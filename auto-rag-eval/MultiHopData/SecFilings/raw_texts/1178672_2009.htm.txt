The Company is mainly involved in exploration work for uranium on properties described in details in subsections Item 2: Properties subsections A throughD, so the Company will present at the outset, a brief Summary of Uranium Exploration analytical procedures in the following paragraphs and a detailed description of these procedures at the end of this Item 2 - Note entitled: Detailed Uranium Exploration Analytical procedures.
Item 2: SUMMARY OF URANIUM EXPLORATION ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES:
Summary of Sampling Methods, Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The sampling program at MATOUSH PROJECT, including all aspects of Quality Assurance and Quality Control (“QA/QC”), is supervised by the Company’s Chief Geologist, Jonathan Lafontaine, P. Geo., who is a Qualified Person as defined under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”).
Drill core is hydraulically split on-site by dedicated personnel and samples are collected over 30 cm to 3 m intervals based on geology. All reported samples are split with hydraulic splitter. Samples are individually bagged and tagged and shipped as per transportation protocols. Blanks, duplicates, and standards are randomly inserted in the sample shipment within the sample number sequence.
Prior to shipping, sealed sample bags are stored in a locked facility. Samples are shipped via air to Témiscamie float plane base, trucked to Chibougamau and from there sent by courier to the Geo-analytical Laboratories at the Saskatchewan Research Council (“SRC”) in Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan in Canada. The laboratory is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada as an ISO/IEC 17025 Laboratory for Mineral Analysis Testing. On arrival at SRC, samples are sorted into lots according to radioactivity level and prepped and analyzed in that order. Samples are dried and jaw crushed to 60% passing -2 mm and 100 g to 200 g sub sample split out using a riffler. The sub-sample is pulverized to 90% passing 106 microns using a ring and puck grinding mill. The mills are cleaned between samples using steel wool and compressed air.
After sample preparation, SRC analyzes for U3O8content by several means. ICP 4-3R (partial digestion) and fluorimetry are used on samples with U3O8 less than 100 PPM. ICP 4-3 (total digestion) is employed on samples with normal to high radioactivity, hence for the majority of the samples submitted. Samples with greater than 1,000 PPM U3O8 are also subjected to an Aqua Regia digestion before determination of wt% U3O8 also by ICP. The Company independently adds one blank sample and one quarter split duplicate each with every 14 samples. Results are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
In addition to chemical analysis, the Company employs a down-hole gamma probe instrument to estimate uranium grades. Prior to probing, the holes are washed to eliminate minor mineralization smearing or radon effects. Probe results, in cps units, are converted to eU3O8 (equivalent U3O8) using well established algorithms specifically calibrated to the Matoush deposit. A calibration hole (MT-07-29), for which there are complete chemical analyses, is probed at least once per month to ensure the probe is calibrated accurately and functioning properly. Results are also compared with chemical analysis when received. Discrepancies in results are immediately investigated and corrected.
Analytical results are received and imported into the Company’s data base. Laboratory replicates and laboratory standards are checked. Internal duplicates, blanks and standards are checked. Analytical drift from expected results triggers re-analysis.
Results are also compared with estimated Grade and Thickness (“GT”) values from in-situ down-hole probing, and with counts per second (“CPS”) values logged during initial core logging procedures.
In the following text covering in details exploration works on the Company’s properties, the letter “e” in “eU3O8” represents the estimated orequivalent value of U3O8 as determined by down-hole calibrated geophysical probing.
Further information on the various technical subjects relating to exploration work for uranium, namely the “eU3O8” and “CPS” nomenclatures, exploration program analysis methods, sampling techniques, quality control for the results obtained by the gamma probe and laboratory chemical analyses is available on the Company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com in section “Investor Relations” subsection “Q/A and Q/C” and in this annual report at Item 2 Properties- in the Note: Detailed Uranium exploration analytical procedures.
Item 2 A: MATOUSH PROJECT
The map in Figure 2 below represents the Company interests in different properties constituting the MATOUSH PROJECT including MATOUSH PROPERTY, MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY, ECLAT PROPERTY and PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The MATOUSH PROJECT (See subsection A) is located in the Otish Mountains in northern Quebec, Canada, about 275 kilometres north of Chibougamau, and consists of the wholly-owned MATOUSH PROPERTY (See subsection A.1), the wholly-owned MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY (See subsection A.2), the wholly-owned ECLAT PROPERTY (See subsection A.3) and PACIFIC-BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY in which the Company has an option to earn a 60% interest (See subsection A.4). The MATOUSH PROJECT currently comprises 590 claims for a total area of 32,195.54 hectares (321 km2).
The project is accessible by air, and in winter by the Eastmain winter road, which runs about seven kilometres to the west of the Project. The winter road has been upgraded over a 142-km length to allow access to the camp and transport of equipment and fuel required for 2009. The winter road repair work was carried out as planned. The contract was awarded to Entreprises CARSA Inc. for a second consecutive year. Repair work began in mid-December 2008 and maintenance was ongoing until March 20, 2009. In addition to various materials and a shovel excavator 700,000 litres of fuel and four new 50,000-litre fuel tanks were transported to the site. The four drills belonging to Major Drilling Group International Inc. that were on site were taken away and replaced by two new drills.
The workers and consultants benefit from a 50 persons camp completed in 2007, with all modern commodities.
The technical data in the following text is based on a report entitled: Technical Report on the Mineral Resources Update for the Matoush Uranium Project Central Quebec, Canada, dated September 16, 2008, prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 respecting standards of disclosure for mineral projects (“NI 43-101”). This data has also been reviewed by the authors of the report, David A. Ross, M. Sc. P. Geo. and R. Barry Cook, P. Eng. of Scott Wilson RPA. The technical data in the following text is also based on a memorandum entitled Matoush Mineral Resource Update, dated September 18, 2009, and reviewed by David A. Ross, M. Sc. P. Geo. of Scott Wilson RPA. The technical data based on recent information has been reviewed by Jean-Pierre Lachance, Executive Vice President of the Company. All three are qualified persons as defined in NI 43-101.

U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally minable.
In 2008, the Company began a 40,000-metre drilling program on the MATOUSH PROJECT and planned a budget of $22 million in exploration works. The Company carried out an extensive drilling program on its wholly-owned MATOUSH PROPERTY, located in the Otish Mountains, 275 km north of Chibougamau and the Company obtained interesting drill results. The potential and size of the new MT-22 mineralized zone was confirmed, as well as the extension of the AM-15 zone at depth.
In the second quarter of 2008, drilling was primarily focused on the new MT-34 mineralized zone that lies in the depth extension of the AM-15 zone, as well as on the MT-22 mineralized zone.
Third quarter of 2008, exploration work on the MATOUSH PROJECT essentially consisted of drilling and prospecting. A total of 16,837 metres were drilled in 52 holes. Of this total, 15,327 metres (45 holes) were drilled on the MATOUSH PROPERTY and the remaining 1,510 metres (7 holes) on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The Company prospected in the Laurent Martin area, 5.0 km to the east of the AM-15 lens, where a train of boulders including one that returned nearly 60,000 counts per second had been identified during prospection in summer 2007.
In the fourth quarter 2008, drilling continued on the MATOUSH PROJECT in the northern and southern extensions of well defined lenses and also along the Matoush fault with the objective to identify new mineralised lenses.
Twenty three drillings have been completed for a total of 9,517 metres during the fourth quarter 2008. These drillings explored at the North of the MT-22 lens and the south of the MT-34 lens.
In 2008, a total of 119 holes were drilled on the MATOUSH PROJECT for a total of 59,603 meters leading tothe delineation of Indicated mineral resources of 3.73M pounds U3O8and Inferred mineral Resources of 13.070 M pounds U3O8 as reported in Item 2: Properties-Technical Reports of Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 8.
All exploration drill holes results for the year 2009, longitudinal sections as well as photos of the mineralized intersections can be seen on the company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com.
In 2009, the Company continued to focus its efforts on the exploration and development of its uranium project, the MATOUSH PROJECT, using advanced exploration methods. The Company drilled 75 holes on its various properties for a total of 35,026 metres of drilling, including 34,240 metres on the MATOUSH PROJECT. Most notably, the holes drilled on the MATOUSH PROJECT resulted in the doubling of the indicated mineral resource to 7.46 million pounds of U3O8at the high grade of 0.78% U3O8.
The true width of the mineralized intersections of the holes drilled in 2009 has not yet been determined.
In order to describe the exploration work in 2009 conducted on its uranium properties in details, the Company must include in this annual report a description of the techniques used and required for exploration work, namely: (i) analytical procedures used in the exploration program; (ii) sampling methods; (iii) quality assurance and control (including information on the use of the letter “e” in eU3O8, which represents the estimatedor equivalentU3O8value determined using a calibrated spectral or gamma probe); (iv) the methodology for the use of the gamma probe; and, finally, (v) a comparison of eU3O8and U3O8 results.
This technical description can be found in the NOTE following the Item 2: Properties and in the QA/QC section under the About Strateco tab on the Company’s website, at www.stratecoinc.com.
In 2009, 68 holes totalling 34,240 metres were drilled on the MATOUSH PROJECT as a whole. Drilling was distributed as follows: 26,144 metres in 44 holes on the MATOUSH PROPERTY; 4,375 metres in 11 holes on the ECLAT property, and 3,721 metres in 13 holes on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH property. No drilling was done on the MATOUSH EXTENSION property. In all, 160,216 metres (378 holes) have been drilled on the MATOUSH PROJECT since exploration began in 2006.
The 2009 drilling program began in early February on the MATOUSH PROJECT, with two drills in operation. One drill was assigned to drilling on the southern extension of the MT-34 zone, about 1 km away from that zone, with the goal of identifying a new lens at a depth of between -400 and -650 metres. The second drill was first mobilized on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH property to drill 1,500 metres in the Rabbit Ears South area, and was then moved in early March to an area of the ECLAT property 9.5 km south of the MT-34 zone, near Hole EC-08-01, which returned very interesting results in the winter of 2008.
Drilling was temporarily suspended during the spring thaw, from April 27 to May 27. Drilling then resumed, with two drills operating on the properties, as well as one helicopter-borne drill for holes drilled on the MISTASSINI and PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH properties. Besides the exploration holes, five geotechnical holes totalling 526 metres were drilled as part of the preparatory work for the underground exploration program. The 2009 drilling program ended on November 26.
The MATOUSH PROJECT remains the Company’s priority in the pursuit of its objective to become the first Québec Company to advance a uranium exploration project to the underground exploration stage.
Item 2: A1. MATOUSH PROPERTY
The Company owns a 100% interest in this uranium property representing for the moment the main focus of the MATOUSH PROJECT located about 275 km north of Chibougamau, in the Otish Mountains, in Québec, Canada (See Figure 1 for regional location of the MATOUSH PROPERTY).
Location and Access
This property is accessible by air, and in winter by the Eastmain winter road, which runs about seven kilometres to the west of the property.
Mining Claims
The property consists of 25 claims covering an area of 1,328.46 hectares.
A letter of intent dated May 12, 2005 provided for the Company to earn a 51% interest from Ditem Explorations Inc. ("Ditem"), which owned then a 100% interest in the MATOUSH PROPERTY, in consideration of payments totalling $125,000 over two years, including $5,000 on signature of the agreement; $750,000 in exploration work over three years, including $200,000 the first year; and the issuance of 600,000 common shares of the Company over two years. The Beaver Lake Area project, which lied approximately 20 kilometres to the west, was also covered by this initial agreement.
A new letter of intent was signed with Ditem on February 21, 2006, giving the Company a 100% interest in the MATOUSH PROPERTY under the following terms: The Company paid $10,000 at the execution of the letter of intent and within five days following approval of the transaction by regulatory authorities, the Company paid to Ditem $140,000 and issued to Ditem 400,000 common shares. The shares were subject to a resale restriction of four months plus a day. Ditem became entitled upon production to a 2% NSR, as defined by industry standards. The claims in the Beaver Lake area have not been renewed by the Company upon acquisition of this 100% interest in the MATOUSH PROPERTY.
Uranium Potential
The Otish Mountains area is well known for its uranium potential, particularly due to exploration conducted by Uranerz Exploration and Mining (“Uranerz”) and Cogema in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The results of exploration conducted by Uranerz in the early 1980s before uranium prices tumbled, as well as those obtained by the Company in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, indicated that the MATOUSH PROPERTY had a very good potential.
Uranerz only explored a 900-metre section of the Matoush structure, which had been traced over 3,900 metres on this property. The Matoush structure was discovered in the early 1980s by the German company. In 1984, Uranerz drilled 23 holes, including Hole AM-15, which returned a 16-metre intersection at a vertical depth of 200 metres grading 0.95%U3O8 or over 20 pounds of U3O8 per tonne of ore, a very high grade by today’s standards. Due to low uranium prices from 1985 to 2005, the uranium potential of the MATOUSH PROPERTY was not explored any further. Uranerz exploration work results dated from the late 1970s and early 1980s and preceded the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”)
Cautionary Note: A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate by Uranerz as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The Company does not consider resources or reserves of an historical estimate to be mineral resources or mineral reserves, as these categories are defined in articles 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI 43-101, as amended. The investor or reader should not rely upon this historical estimate.
This exploration work by Uranerz served however as the Company's point of departure for exploration of the MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The holes drilled on the MATOUSH PROPERTY indicated that the uranium mineralization was closely linked to the fuschite and tourmaline alteration on both sides of a gabbros dike in the sediments. The alteration envelope associated with the Matoush structure was symmetrical, with an average thickness of 40 metres. Typically, adjacent to and moving outward from the dike was first a tourmaline zone, then a chlorite-fuschite-muscovite zone and a limonite-hematite zone.
In 2009, the Company carried out surface exploration on 26,144 metres in 44 holes of surface drilling on the property.
Given the structural context at MATOUSH PROPERTY, various zones of varying grade and thickness were outlined using a smaller drill grid.
It should be noted that the southern extension of the AM-15 zone was tested in the winter of 2006-2007 along the ACF unit that hosts the AM-15 resources.
Detailed geological interpretation of the AM-15 zone as part of the NI 43-101 resource estimate in September 2007 revealed that the AM-15 zone dips about 200 to the south and that the mineralization appears to continue in the underlying CBF unit. Drilling carried out on the lake ice showed clearly that the AM-15 zone continues at depth toward the south.
The five holes drilled in the less porous, 75-metre thick intermediate CBF unit all intersected the fault zone, with variable thicknesses and grades that averaged 0.08% eU3O8over 4.2metres. The mineralization extends to the lower CBF contact, and the goal was to explore the underlying ACF unit in the extension of the AM-15 zone plunge.
The potential of this major mineralized zone was supported by the marked presence of fuschite alteration and the absence of dykes in the three most northern holes (MT-08-001, MT-08-003, MT-07-129), which returned the best intersections. Drilling on the AM-15 lens had shown that the best intersections corresponded to the intensity of the fuschite alteration and the absence of dykes.
The drill results resulted in an initial resource estimate for the AM-15 zone in September 2007, discovery of a new zone (MT-22) and confirmation of the extension of the AM-15 zone at depth. On September 27, 2007, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) completed a NI 43-101 technical report on the MATOUSH PROPERTY, including a resource estimate on the AM-15 core zone.
Scott Wilson RPA prepared the initial mineral resource estimate for the AM-15 core zone at MATOUSH PROPERTY using drill-hole data available as of September 27, 2007. This technical report concluded that, Indicated mineral resources were estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79%U3O8 containing 3.48million pounds of U3O8. Inferred mineral resources were estimated to total 65,000 tonnes grading 0.43%U3O8 containing 0.62 million pounds.
Results of this resource estimate have been described in details in Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2007 at Item 2 Properties-MATOUSH PROPERTY.
Through geophysical surveys and several drill holes on the MATOUSH PROPERTY, the Company also established the presence of the Matoush fault and sedimentary horizons ACF-3 (AM-15 zone) and ACF-4 (MT-22 and MT-34 zones) on a distance of over 15 km, including a mineralized section located by Hole EC-08-01, 8.5 km south of the AM-15 zone. This hole intersected 0.15% eU3O8over 2.1metres at a vertical depth of 550 metres in the ACF-4. These ACF horizons of coarse sediments represent a favourable context for uranium precipitation.
Two holes drilled in the ACF-4 (MT-08-019 and MT-08-027) proved encouraging, both in terms of geological context and the potential size of the mineralized body and showed a fault offset that is a prime site for uranium precipitation.
During the second quarter of 2008, the drill results confirmed the potential in uranium sought by the Company, especially on the MT-34 zone, which lies in the ACF-4, as does the MT-22 zone.
Extensive surface exploration and airborne VLF geophysics were carried out during the summer 2008 on MATOUSH PROPERTY.
During the third quarter of 2008, the exploration holes drilled in the northern extension of the AM-15 zone (600 m to the north) and the MT-22 zone (200 m to the north) resulted in the identification of a new fault, the Coonishish fault. This fault lies about 200 m east of the Matoush fault and is sub parallel to it. Two sections spaced at approximately 75 metres were drilled to determine the fault’s strike and dip and assess its uranium potential. The task proved relatively arduous, as the Coonishish fault is cut by other siliceous, clayey faults. From an exploration perspective, the results
were compelling, as the genesis model allowed the confirmation of a second system detached from the Matoush fault. The Coonishish fault was intersected in almost all the layers: ACF 1, 2 and 3 and CBF 1, 2 and 3. Only one hole has intercepted mineralization to date, with the notable presence of fuschite alteration, which remains a key element for exploration. Hole MT-08-084 returned an intersection of 0.04% eU3O8over 2.0metres.
Exploration work
MT-22 ZONE
The new MT-22 mineralized zone discovered by the Company in 2007 on the MATOUSH PROPERTY lies under the AM-15 zone and is parallel to its plunge. The MT-22 lens drilled on a grid of approximately 100 m, lies at a vertical depth of between -300 m and -650 m and over a length of 450 m, between sections 31+50S and 27+00S and remained open to the north over its full height (350 m) (see longitudinal section on the Company’s website: www.stratecoinc.com ). Given the known structural context of MATOUSH PROPERTY, several lenses with various grades and thicknesses were expected from drilling on a tighter grid and were also expected to return significant grades at the intersection with the Matoush fault.
In comparison, the AM-15 zone is 50 metres high and 300 metres long, contained an estimated resource of 4.1million pounds of U3O8 according to the Technical Report on the Matoush Uranium Project Central Quebec, Canada NI 43-101 of Scott Wilson RPA dated September 27, 2007.
Between November 2007 and March 2008, more than 25 holes had been drilled on this new MT-22 zone. Good results on the MT-22 zone were obtained in the two last holes drilled in 2007, MT-07-129 and MT-07-130, and were located 80 metres apart at the same depth, -350 metres. Hole MT-07-129, which intersected 8.3 metres at 0.24% eU3O8, including 3.7metres at 0.51%eU3O8, was encouraging, particularly as the alteration halo in this hole is identical to that of the AM-15 zone.
The holes drilled in the first quarter of 2008 on the MT-22 zone proved positive, with impressive intersections that confirm the importance of this major new zone. The best intersections included Hole MT-08-003, with 2.86%eU3O8 over 5.8 metres including 4.48% eU3O8 over 3.4metres and Hole MT-08-013 with 0.52% eU3O8over 7.2metres.
In February 2008 the Company intersected a new high grade section at the North End of the MT-22 lens and in March 2008, the Company realised that the MT-22 mineralized zone on the MATOUSH PROPERTY, discovered at depth under the AM-15 zone, was proving to be major and planned for 50,000 metres of drilling during the year 2008 on this property.
During the second quarter of 2008, drilling on the MT-22 mineralized zone, continued on a 50-metre grid in preparation for the next resource estimate. The results for this zone were conclusive. The best results were obtained in holes MT-08-022, 028, 036 and 043. Hole MT-08-022 intersected 0.37% eU3O8 over 18.4m, including 1.16% eU3O8 over 5.3m. Hole MT-08-027, drilled in early April 2008, returned an exceptionally wide mineralized section of 63 metres downhole, representing a true width of about 23 metres. The hole intersected 0.05% eU3O8 over 63.2 metres, including 0.13% eU3O8over 8.0metres showing a strong potential for this sector. Hole MT-08-028 intersected 0.47% eU3O8 over 41.6m, including 2.40% eU3O8 over 7.0m. Hole MT-08-036 intersected 0.41% eU3O8over 7.5m, including 1.25%eU3O8 over 2.0m, and Hole MT-08-043 intersected 2.45% eU3O8 over 10.5 m, including an high-grade section of 2.0 m at 8.97% eU3O8.
The most interesting holes drilled up to the end of the second quarter of 2008 on the MT-22 zone are indicated in bold in the following table:
* Grades determined by chemical analysis
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
These equivalent uranium values were generated by the Gamma probe.
During the third quarter of 2008, five holes (3,096 metres) were drilled for the definition of the MT-22 zone on the MATOUSH PROPERTY. Two holes (MT-08-061 and 064) were drilled in the MT-22 zone to provide geological information within the mineral resource envelope. The three other holes (MT-08-077, 079 and 080) were drilled within the envelope in the northern extension of the MT-22 zone between the -400 m and -450 m levels. The hole MT-08-077 intersected 0.80% eU3O8 over 7.0m, including 2.07% eU3O8 over 2.2m.
The holes in the northern part were drilled from 500 metres to 1 km from the MT-22 zone, between sections 18+00S and 22+00S, from near surface to -425 metres. These holes failed to intersect any new zones. However, three of the four holes drilled on section 20+00S intercepted very strong fuschite alteration, which represented a favourable environment for the deposition of uranium mineralization. The best result was obtained in Hole MT-08-098, which returned a grade of 0.06% eU3O8over 2.8 metres in the ACF 3.
These results were not part of the resource estimate of September 2008 since the cut-off date of this technical Report was July 25, 2008 (See Item 2: sub-section A-1, entitled: TECHNICAL REPORTS).
All the results of MT-22 zone can be viewed on the longitudinal section on the Company’s website, at www.stratecoinc.com.
MT-34 ZONE
During the winter of 2006-2007, the Southern Extension of the AM-15 zone was drilled along the ACF horizon hosting the AM-15 estimated resources.
Detailed geological interpretation of the AM-15 zone revealed that the zone dipped about 200 to the south, and that the mineralization appeared to continue in the underlying CBF unit. Drilling to be carried out on the lake ice began at the end of January 2008. The holes drilled show clearly that the AM-15 zone continues at depth toward the south. The goal was then to explore the underlying ACF layer, the same unit that hosted the MT-22 zone to the north.
In 2008, the Company explored and outlined the Southern Extension of the AM-15 zone at depth. This new zone had returned impressive core lengths with lower U3O88 grades than the AM-15 and MT-22 zones. However, it should be noted that exploration of this area had just begun, and based on the MT-22 zone model, there were likely high-grade zone in the ACF at depths of between -300 and -650 metres.
Five holes were drilled in the CBF unit, and intersected values similar to those seen in the same CBF unit above the MT-22 zone.
This drilling on the Southern Extension of AM-15 led to the discovery of a new mineralized zone, the MT-34 lens, on the Company’s MATOUSH PROPERTY at the end of April 2008.
Drilled in this new area at the end of the first quarter of 2008, holes MT-08-019 and MT-08-027 (see table above) revealed a major displacement of the Matoush fault between the two holes. Hole MT-08-034 was planned on the basis of this observation.
The understanding of the geology and mineralization obtained from three years of work led to the discovery of this new, high-grade uranium zone and could likely result in the discovery of other mineralized zones. In fact, work by the Company has shown that the high-grade areas of the AM-15 and MT-22 uranium zones are associated with horizontal displacement of the Matoush fault.
The new zone, named MT-34, was intersected by Hole MT-08-034 at a vertical depth of 370 metres, south of the AM-15 and MT-22 zones. The Hole MT-08-034 was the most interesting hole drilled by the Company at that time on the MATOUSH PROPERTY (the location of Hole MT-08-034 can be seen at www.stratecoinc.com).
Hole MT-08-034 had intersected mineralization over a 54.4 -metre section of drill core and graded an average of 0.69%eU3O8, including a 28.0 -metre section grading at an average of 1.32% eU3O8 (29 lbs/tonne) and a 4.80 -metre section with a grade of 6.13% eU3O8 (135 lbs/tonne). The true width of the mineralized sections had not yet been determined. The equivalent uranium values were generated by the Gamma probe.
Following Hole MT-08-034, 11 other holes were drilled in the MT-34 area to test the extensions of this new mineralized zone. The results were conclusive, showing a high-grade core within the MT-34 zone. Hole MT-08-047 intersected a 10.0 -metre mineralized zone grading an average of 2.24% eU3O8, including a 3.0 -metre section grading 3.20% eU3O8 at a vertical depth of 454 metres, about 70 metres south of hole MT-08-034.
The most interesting hole drilled on the MT-34 zone were: Hole MT-08-047, at a vertical depth of 454 metres about 70 metres south of MT-08-034, which intersected a 10.0 -metre mineralized section grading an average of 2.24% eU3O8, including 3.0metres with a grade of 3.20% eU3O8.
Two other holes drilled between holes MT-08-034 and MT-08-047 on a 40-metre grid in preparation for the next resource estimate confirmed the potential of this new zone. Hole MT-08-050 intersected the mineralized zone over 21.6 metres averaging 0.44% eU3O8, including1.8metres grading 1.88% eU3O8, while hole MT-08-053 intersected an 11.4 -metre mineralized section averaging 2.02% eU3O8, including 5.2m grading 4.38% eU3O8.
The most interesting results for holes drilled on the MT-34 zone are indicated in bold in the following table:
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
The equivalent uranium values were generated by the Gamma probe.
Holes MT-08-062 and MT-08-068, drilled to an approximate depth of -450 m about 190 m north of the heart of the MT-34 zone, returned interesting results, with respective intersections of 1.86% eU3O8 over 3.1m (including 2.3% eU3O8 over 2.3m) and 0.05% eU3O8 over 1.39m. In the depth extension, hole MT-08-058 (-530 m) returned a notable intersection of 0.03% eU3O8 over 19.3m, including 0.13% U3O8 over 1.6m. Hole MT-08-069 (-580 m) returned 0.19% eU3O8 over 1.0m. (The hole pierce points and results can be seen on longitudinal section on the Company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com).
Hole MT-08-105 intersected 0.06% eU3O8 over 3.5metres and Hole MT-08-107 intersected 0.02% eU3O8 over 7.1 metres, including 0.10% eU3O8 over 0.9metres.
Finally, six holes were drilled in the MT-34 zone extensions, particularly the southern extension. The best hole was MT-08-083, which returned 0.16% eU3O8 over 7.7metres, including 0.37% eU3O8 over 1.2metres. Drilling ended on December 5, 2008.
With the exception of Hole MT-08-062, these holes were not part of the resource estimate as of July 25, 2008 (See following Item 2 A.1, sub-section entitled: TECHNICAL REPORTS).
As of April, 2009, the 30,000-metre exploration drilling program which started in February 2009 had already resulted in the discovery of two new mineralized zones on the Company’s MATOUSH PROJECT.
Hole MT-006, drilled in April 2009, is located on section 46+00S, 1.0 km south of the MT-34 core zone. The new mineralized zone was intersected by Hole MT-09-006, which returned an 8.9 -metre intersection grading 0.21% eU3O8, including 1.1 metres at 0.96% eU3O8. This intersection is strongly altered in fuschite with the presence of pitchblende and uranophanes, and is similar in size, grade and alteration to intersections near the MT-34 and MT-22 core zones.
*Core length
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
The equivalent uranium grades are obtained using a spectral probe.
As of the end of May 2009, the Company resumed exploration drilling campaign that had been halted temporarily at the end of April 2009 for the spring break-up. This campaign was part of the 30,000-metre exploration drilling program which started in February 2009, on the Company’s wholly-owned MATOUSH PROPERTY.
MT-006 ZONE
Drilling continued with one of two drills, in Hole MT-09-011 which was interrupted at a depth of 180 metres and is located on the new MT-006 zone discovered in April 2009. The MT-006 zone is located on section 46+00S, 1.0 km south of the MT-34 core zone. Hole MT-09-006 returned an 8.9 -metre intersection grading 0.21% eU3O8including1.1 metres at 0.96% eU3O8. Thisintersection is strongly altered in fuschite with the presence of pitchblende and uranophanes and is similar in size, grade and alteration to intersections near the MT-34 and MT-22 core zones.
As for the second drill mobilized for geotechnical drilling as part of preliminary work for the underground drilling program, it went back to exploration drilling in the first week of June 2009.
Before going back to the MT-006 zone, the drill made a stop in the sector of the high grade MT-34 lens, where hole MT-08-034 had intersected 1.32% eU3O8 on 28.0metres including 6.13% eU3O8 on 4.8metres. Two strategic drill holes were carried out in order to expand already delineated mineral resources.
On the MT-34 zone, indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 88,000 tonnes grading 0.97% U3O8 containing 1,890,000 pounds U3O8 and inferred resources that were estimated to total 527,000 tonnes grading 0.55% U3O8 containing 6,350,000 pounds U3O8 These results came from the NI 43-101 resource estimate updated by Scott Wilson RPAin September 2008.
As of July 2009, one of the two drills in operation on the MATOUSH PROPERTY, wholly-owned by the Company, had been assigned to the MT-34 zone area. Due to the high grades obtained in Hole MT-34 (1.36% U3O8 over 27.50 m including 6.03% U3O8 over 4.80 m) relative to the other grades and thicknesses for the zone, the influence of Hole MT-34 in the September 2008 resource estimate done by Scott Wilson RPA was voluntarily limited. Furthermore, because a 50 m x 70 m drill grid was used in the area of Hole MT-34 in 2008, this resource could not be categorized as an indicated resource.
The four holes drilled in June and the fifth hole allowed the total MT-34 zone resource to be increased and a portion of the resource to be upgraded from inferred to indicated.
Scott Wilson RPA was retained to prepare an update of the resource estimate for the MT-34 zone. The memorandum is entitled: Matoush Mineral Resources Update, dated September 18, 2009 prepared by David A. Ross, M.Sc. P. Geo of Scott Wilson RPA and is further detailed in Item 2 A.1, sub-section entitled: TECHNICAL REPORTS
Four holes (MT-09-012, 014, 016 and 019) were drilled in the upper part of the MT-34 zone in June 2009. Three of the four holes intersected high grades over considerable intervals.
Hole MT-09-019, with a pierce point in the upper part of the ACF-4 near the contact with the CBF, 35 m north of Hole MT-08-051 (0.40% eU3O8 over 5.1 m), intersected 0.26% eU3O8 over 14.1metres, including a section of 0.95% eU3O8 over 2.8m. Hole MT-09-017 was drilled on the same section, but was abandoned due to excessive deviation. Hole MT-09-014 returned an intersection of 0.08% eU3O8over 5.1m. This hole lies at the lower limit of the MT-34 zone. Hole MT-09-020 was drilled to test the extension of Hole MT-08-034 up dip from the MT-34 zone
in the direction of the upper part of the ACF-4. Another hole was planned on the MT-34 zone at a vertical depth of -470 m between holes MT-08-047 and MT-08-055, alongside the MT-34 zone in an area where no resources were estimated.
*Core length
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
The equivalent uranium grades are obtained using a spectral probe.
All exploration drill holes results of 2009 and longitudinal sections can be seen on the company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com.
The drill results for the first quarter of 2009 were promising, particularly south of the MT-34 zone. Hole MT-09-006, drilled 1 km away from the heart of the MT-34 zone on Section 46 + 00S, intersected a 8.9 -metre zone strongly altered in fuschite with the presence of pitchblende and uranophanes. This intersection graded 0.27% U3O8 over 9.5 metres, including 0.97% U3O8 over 1.2metres.
The four completed holes (MT-09-011, 013, 015 and 018) all intercepted the Matoush fault, with anomalous uranium values.
In the second quarter, another eight holes were drilled in the MT-006 area on a 100-metre grid to test the continuity of the Hole MT-09-006 intersection. The best hole was MT-09-009, drilled to a vertical depth of -600 metres along the presumed plunge of MT-09-006, 100 metres away. It intersected 0.11% U3O8 over 2.4metres at the level of the fault.
Early in June, one of the two drills in operation on the MATOUSH PROPERTY was assigned to the MT-34 zone area. Due to the high grades obtained in Hole MT-08-034 (1.36% U3O8 over 27.5 m including 6.03% U3O8 over 4.8 m) relative to the other grades and thicknesses for the zone, the influence of Hole MT-08-034 in the September 2008 resource estimate done by Scott Wilson RPA was voluntarily limited.
Furthermore, because a 50 m x 70 m drill grid was used in the area of MT-08-034 in 2008, this resource could not be categorized as an indicated resource.
Four holes were drilled in the upper part of the MT-34 zone in June 2009. Three of the four holes intersected high grades over considerable intervals.
Hole MT-09-012, whose pierce point lies just a few metres from Hole MT-08-50 due to strong deviation, returned an intersection of 0.69% U3O8 over 25.5 metres, including 1.44% U3O8 over 7.2 metres.
Hole MT-09-016, whose pierce point lies midway between holes MT-08-050 and MT-08-34, returned an intersection of 0.56% U3O8 over 25.8 metres, including 0.94% U3O8 over 12.5 metres, while Hole MT-08-050 previously intersected 0.49% U3O8 over 21.3m, including 1.99% U3O8 over 2.0m.
On or about the end of July 2009, the Company discovered a uranium high grade intersection in the extension of the MT-34 lens.
In fact, hole MT-09-022 has intersected 0.99% eU3O8 over 30.6 metres including 5.98% eU3O8 over 4.5 metres.
This drill hole, with a pierce point located on section 34+85S at a vertical depth of 456 metres in the extension on the MT-34 lens, is one of the best holes drilled to date by the Company on its wholly-owned MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The pierce point of MT-09-022 is located outside of the resources estimated by Scott Wilson RPA published in September 2008 and as such its results are interesting.
Another drill hole was planned at the same elevation, 50 metres south of MT-09-022, to fill in the gap between holes MT-09-022 and MT-08-062 located 100 metres apart.
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
Location of pierce point of Hole MT-09-022 can be seen on the MT-34 longitudinal section available on the Company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com.
As of July, 2009, 20,000 metres of the planned 30,000 metres of exploration drilling in 2009 had been completed.
At the end of September 2009, the Company increased its 2009 surface exploration program from 30,000 metres to 35,000 metres of drilling.
In the third quarter of 2009, drilling continued steadily on the MATOUSH PROPERTY, with two drills in operation. One drill (1419) was dedicated to definition drilling on the MT-34 zone to improve data quality in preparation for a new resource estimate. The second drill (1420) was essentially used for exploration drilling on the southern extension of the MT-34 zone (widely-spaced holes).
The closely-spaced holes drilled on the MT-34 zone returned very good results overall, confirming and increasing confidence in the geological continuity and high grades, as can be seen by the increase in the indicated resource and grades in the new September 2009 update of the resource estimate.
The 2009 drilling program continued with two drills working on the property. One of these was assigned to systematic drilling on a 200-metre grid to locate new mineralized zones in the southern extension of the MT-34 zone, in the upper part of the ACF-4 stratigraphic unit.
The Company plans to carry out 60,000 metres of surface drilling per year in 2010 and 2011, in parallel with underground exploration work. The results of the surface drilling program should allow the maximum capacity of the Matoush ore processing plant to be established.
In 2011, the Company plans to begin the environmental studies required for mill and tailings pond construction. These studies are required to obtain a mine construction permit.
In addition to the definition drilling, the results for the 12 exploration holes drilled to the south of the AM-15 zone in the ACF-3 and south of the MT-34 zone in the upper ACF-4 confirmed the new-zone discovery potential. Of the three holes drilled approximately 400 metres south of the AM-15 zone in the ACF-3 (MT-09-30, 031, 032), Hole MT-09-030 proved the most encouraging, with a mineralized intersection of 3.9 metres grading 0.26% U3O8. The nine holes drilled in the ACF-4 over a distance of 1,800 metres along strike, relatively loosely spaced at about 200 metres, all intersected the Matoush fault and an alteration halo typical of the one around the mineralized zones. The three last holes (MT-09-035 to 038), drilled in virgin ground, proved the most interesting, with intersections of 0.17% U3O8 over 2.0 metres in Hole MT-09-035 and 0.48% U3O8 over 4.2 metres in Hole MT-09-036.
The 2009 drilling program continued, with two drills working on the property. One of these is assigned to systematic drilling on a 200-metre grid to locate new mineralized zones in the southern extension of the MT-34 zone, in the upper part of the ACF-4 stratigraphic unit. The two most recent holes confirmed mineralization to the south. Hole MT-09-035, drilled 1.0 km south of the edge of the current mineral resources, intersected the mineralized zone over 2.9 metres grading 0.12% eU3O8,lying characteristically at the contact of the Matoush fault. Hole MT-09-036 was drilled 200 metres further south from MT-09-035, and intersected a 4.7 -metre section of mineralization grading 0.26% eU3O8(see longitudinal sections at www.stratecoinc.com).
These results confirm the very important potential for increasing the resource on the MATOUSH and ECLAT PROPERTIES over an 11.1 km distance along the Matoush fault, to the south of the mineralized envelope hosting the resources. As previously reported, two holes drilled 200 metres apart, last winter in the upper part of the ACF-4 (EC-09-05 and EC-09-06) more than 6 km south of Hole MT-09-036 returned very good results (0.12% eU3O8 over 2.6 metres and 0.11% eU3O8 over 2.1 metres).

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors concerning estimates of Measured and Indicated Resources. This section uses the terms “measured” and “indicated resources”. We advise U.S. investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize them. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors concerning estimates of Inferred Resources. This section uses the term “inferred resources.” We advise U.S. investors that while this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize it. “Inferred resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally minable.
1. Mineral Resource Classification, Category and Definition
The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) guideline for resource classification includes the following definitions which are pertinent to the classification of the Matoush Property resource:
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
The Technical Report on the Mineral Resources Update for the Matoush Uranium Project Central Quebec, Canada, NI 43-101 resource estimate completed by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. ("Scott Wilson RPA") on September 16, 2008, assessed the resources for the MATOUSH PROJECT of the AM-15, MT-22 and MT-34 zones. On September 18, 2008, the Company deposited on SEDAR, (www.sedar.com), this technical report prepared by Mr. R. Barry Cook, P.Eng. and Mr. David A. Ross, P.Geo.of Scott Wilson RPA, who are qualified persons pursuant to NI 43-101.
Scott Wilson RPA has updated the NI 43-101 Resource estimate for the MATOUSH PROJECT using drill hole data available as of July 25, 2008, at a cut-off grade of 0.05% U3O8, Indicated mineral resources were estimated to total 250 thousand tonnes grading 0.68% U3O8 containing 3.73 million pounds U3O8. Inferred mineral resources were estimated to total1.3 million tonnes grading 0.44% U3O8 containing13.07 million pounds U3O8.The Mineral Resources are contained within three zones: AM-15, MT-22 and MT-34.
This resource estimate showed, as of August 2008, with the data as of July 25, 2008, an increase of 300% from the last technical report pursuant to NI 43-101 dated September 27, 2007.
Scott Wilson RPA concluded that there is also potential for unconformity-type uranium deposits on the MATOUSH PROPERTY.
There are no mineral reserves estimated at MATOUSH PROJECT. See longitudinal section on www.stratecoinc.com.
Table 1 - Mineral Resource Estimate for Matoush, July 25,
Notes:
1.
CIM Definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
2.
The cut-off grade of 0.05% U3 O8 was estimated using a price of US$55/lb and assumed operating costs.
3.
Wireframes at 0.05% U3 O8 and a minimum true thickness of 1.5 metres were used to constrain the grade interpolation.
4.
High U3 O8 grades were cut to 9% prior to compositing to two metre lengths
5.
Several blocks less than 0.05% U3 O8 were included for continuity or to expand the lenses to the minimum thickness.
6.
Totals may not sum correctly due to rounding.
The Matoush drill holes included 257 diamond core holes totalling more than 98,000 m. A set of cross sections and plan views were interpreted to construct three-dimensional wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 0.05% U3O8, and a minimum true thickness of 1.5metres. High U3O8 values were cut to 9% U3O8 prior to compositing to two metres. Variogram parameters were interpreted from two metres composited U3O8 values. Block model U3O8 grades within the wireframe models were estimated by ordinary kriging. More than 98% of the U3O8 values in the drill hole database used in the grade estimate were derived from chemical analysis. The remaining values, from 27 of the most recent drill holes, were derived from gamma-probe data.
Classification into the Indicated and Inferred categories was guided by the drill hole density, interpreted variogram ranges and the apparent continuity of the mineralized zones.
The Inferred category had a general drilling grid of approximately 50 metres by 50 metres up to 70 metres.
On September 18, 2009, Scott Wilson RPA has updated the NI 43-101-compliant resource estimate for the MATOUSH PROJECT based on drill results available as of September 1st, 2009 and using similar methods as applied in the previous estimate (Scott Wilson RPA, Sept. 2008). At a cut-off grade of 0.10% U3O8, the indicated mineral resources are now estimated at 436,000 tonnes grading 0.78% U3O8 containing 7.46 million pounds U3O8, and the inferred mineral resources are estimated at 1.16 million tonnes grading 0.50% U3O8 containing 12.78 million pounds U3O8. These resources lie in the AM-15, MT-34 and MT-22 zones, and extend over a strike-length of 1.4 km. The Matoush structure has been traced 11 km to the south and 2.5 km to the north.
The increase in the indicated resources from 3.73 million pounds grading 0.67% U3O8 (Scott Wilson RPA, Sept. 2008) to 7.46 million pounds at 0.78% U3O8 is significant. The indicated resources for the MT-34 zone, which lies in the upper part of the ACF-4 stratigraphic unit, is now estimated at 174,000 tonnes grading 0.89% U3O8 containing 3.42million pounds U3O8. It should be noted that no indicated resources have yet been estimated for the MT-22 zone due to the current drill hole spacing, which is about 50 metres by 50 metres. This zone will be drilled at a tighter spacing during the underground exploration program.
Mineral reserves have not been estimated for the MATOUSH PROJECT.

Table 2 - Mineral Resource Estimate for Matoush - Different Cut-off Grades
Beginning in late January 2010, three drills worked full time to systematically explore the best targets identified during this first phase. While only a small part of the first phase has been completed this far, new targets have already been defined. The main targets are on the ECLAT PROPERTY (Drill holes EC-09-05, 06 and 08) and the MATOUSH PROPERTY (Drill holes MT-09-035, 036 and 038).
SCOPING STUDY DATED DECEMBER 17, 2008
Concurrently with the Technical Report dated September 16, 2008, discussed in the preceding subsection, the Company had also mandated Scott Wilson RPA with the participation of Melis Engineering Ltd. for capital and processing costs, Golder Associates for radiation, environment and reclamation costs and SD Energy Associates Ltd. (SD Energy) for marketing and price determination to prepare a Scoping Study.
The Scoping Study report entitled: Technical Report on the preliminary assessment of the Matoush Project, Central Québec, Canada, NI 43-101 Report dated December 17, 2008 provided first economics assessment of the Company’s 100% owned MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The following technical data has been read and revised by Jean-Pierre Lachance, Geo., Executive Vice President of the Company and Normand L. Lecuyer, P.Eng, Principal Mining Engineer and David A. Ross, P.Geo., Senior geologist at Scott Wilson RPA who are the qualified persons as defined under NI 43-101.
The Scoping Study was based on the NI 43-101 compliant, indicated and inferred resource estimate, established by Scott Wilson RPA in its Technical Report on the Mineral Resource Update for the Matoush Uranium Project, dated September 16, 2008, based on drilling results as of July 25, 2008 that does not include results of the subsequent drilling program (see the preceding table entitled Mineral Resource Estimate for Matoush, July 25, 2008 showing results of inferred and indicated resources in preceding subsection TECHNICAL REPORTS).
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The Scoping Study is preliminary in nature. It includes indicated and inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic consideration applied to them that would enable them to be characterized as mineral reserves and there are no certainties that the Scoping Study will be realized.
The following is a summary of the Scoping Study results. The complete report was made available on the Company’s website (www.stratecoinc.com) and on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) as of December 23, 2008 and were cited cited in detail in Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2008 in Item 2 - A:MATOUSH PROPERTY-SCOPING STUDY DATED DECEMBER 17, 2008.

The Company’s management concluded upon reading this Scoping Study that even with significant inflation in operating costs in the mining industry, the MATOUSH PROJECT indicates strong economics. Even with the dramatic correction in the commodity prices in 2008, it was possible to see the Company’s economics improve despite the input prices decrease. The Company continues to evaluate different engineering alternatives to enhance the project economics. Results of this Scoping Study justify, according to the Company’s management, the underground exploration program as part of the feasibility study.
REVISION OF PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT, FEBRUARY 2010
As of February 2010, based on the Scott Wilson RPA memorandum entitled Update Mineral Resources Estimate for Matoush in September 2009 discussed above, a revision of the Preliminary Assessment was conducted by Scott Wilson RPA with the participation of Melis Engineering Ltd. for capital and processing costs. The updated report will be available on the Company’s website (www.stratecoinc.com) and on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on or about April 9, 2010.
The Preliminary Assessment is based, in part, on inferred resources, and is preliminary in nature. Inferred resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them and to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the reserves development, production and economic forecasts on which this preliminary assessment is based will be realized.
I PRODUCTION AND RECOVERED METAL
The mining plan was based on mineral resources with factors applied for dilution and extraction. Recovered metal is based on metallurgical tests done at SGS Lakefield Research Ltd. in Lakefield, ON; an average of 97.6% recovery is used. Potential grade implied mining dilution at 15% at zero value. Mill design was modified to increase annual mill capacity from 2.0 M to 2.7M pounds U3O8.

V CAPITAL COSTS
According to management of the Company, regardless of the significant inflation in operating costs in the industry, the MATOUSH PROJECT indicates stronger economics, compared to the initial scoping study. Despite a possible price decrease, it is still possible to see the economics improve. The Company continues to evaluate different engineering alternatives to enhance the project’s economics, such as the use of windmills to produce electricity. The Company plans to expand mineral resources on the MATOUSH PROPERTY with an aggressive drilling program of 120,000 meters over the next 24 months.
Item 2.A. 2:ECLAT PROPERTY
Location and Access
The ECLAT PROPERTY is located in the Otish Mountains of northern Québec, immediately south of the MATOUSH PROPERTY. The property is accessible by helicopter as well as by the winter road that links the Eastmain mine to Témiscamie. Please see Figure 1 at page 7 for the general location of ECLAT PROPERTY mining claims.
Mining Claims
The property consists of 90 mining claims covering 4,786.90 hectares. Strateco holds a 100% interest in this property. Please see the General location map of the MATOUSH PROJECT Figure 2 at page 9 for the location of the mining claims of ECLAT PROPERTY.
A letter of intent dated July 12, 2005, granted the Company an option to acquire a 100% interest on all minerals except diamonds of the ECLAT PROPERTY over a period of 4 years.
The agreement provides for the Company to earn its 100% interest by making payments totalling $150,000 over four years, including (i) $7,000 on signature of the agreement and (ii) $7,000 on the first anniversary, $20,000 on the second and third and $96,000 on the fourth anniversary, (iii) by carrying out $500,000 in exploration over four years and (iv) by issuing 600,000 common shares of the Company over three years.
The Company paid the last payment in the amount of $96,000 on June 15, 2009 or on or before the fourth anniversary of the Agreement. The property is subject upon production to a 2% NSR in favour of Vija on all minerals other than diamonds and a 2% portion in favour of Vija of all gross proceeds from the eventual sale or disposition of carbon emission rights tied to the production of uranium on the property.
Uranium Potential
The property is strategically located in a relatively unexplored area with known uranium potential. It is bordered to the north by the MATOUSH PROPERTY, wholly-owned by the Company, and to the south by ground staked by Cameco Corporation (“Cameco”).
The property lies in the southern extension of the Matoush structure, which was traced by Uranerz over 3,900 metres using ground VLF surveys conducted in the early 1980s. The holes drilled by Uranerz and the Company clearly showed uranium potential.
The Matoush structure also appears to continue for at least two kilometres on the ECLAT PROPERTY.
Exploration Work
Hole EC-06-01, drilled 5.8 kilometres south of Uranerz Hole AM-15, primarily to maintain certain mining claims in the area, confirmed the southern extension of the Matoush fault.
The results were compelling. The structure was intersected at 111 metres down the hole, at a vertical depth of 76 metres. While un-mineralized, the typical tourmaline alteration of the structure was intersected over a 10-metre section, with the fault appearing to be strongly choritized. This hole therefore confirms the presence of the Matoush structure over a distance of more than seven kilometres.
The radiometry and magnetometry survey carried out by Aeroquest Limited in the fall of 2006 on the Matoush property also covered the entire ECLAT PROPERTY.
On the southern portion of the MATOUSH PROJECT, on ECLAT PROPERTY, 10 holes were completed (EC-07-01 to 07-10) for a total of 2,260 metres. These exploration holes drilled with the assistance of the helicopter allowed the Matoush fault to be accurately located on the ECLAT PROPERTY, with radiometry on the core showing a low cps.
More drilling was done in this area during winter 2008 at the border with the Cameco Corporation property, 11.5 km south of the AM-15 zone. The first hole (EC-08-01) had to be abandoned at 759 metres because of large influxes of water and sand. However no influxes of water or sand had been encountered in AM-15 and MT-22 zones. It should be noted that the stratigraphy seen in the sediments was the same as that seen in the AM-15 area 8.5 km to the north. A clay brecchia appearing to correspond to the Matoush fault was intersected at a depth of 575 metres down-hole, followed by disseminated mineralization grading 0.15% eU3O8 over 2.1metres at 587 metres.
The next hole, EC-08-02, was drilled on the same line at a depth of 321 metres, with the pierce point 425 metres above the pierce point of EC-08-01, and would appear to indicate that locally, the Matoush fault has an inverse dip, being to the west. However, it should be noted that no anomalies were found in this hole. Finally, Hole EC-08-03 was drilled a few hundred metres north of the border with Cameco’s property, and targeted the basement rock. The basement was reached without any anomalous traces found in the sediments. The basement rock intersected was mafic in nature, and very likely represents the folded extension of the “Camie River” greenstone belt.
As of April 2009, the Company discovered on the ECLAT PROPERTY, part of the MATOUSH PROJECT a second mineralized zone. Drilled 9.5 km south of the MT-34 zone, Hole EC-09-05 intersected two mineralized zones 20 metres apart in the Matoush fault, one intersected 1.5 metres at a grade of 0.08% eU3O8 and the other 2.6 metres at a grade of 0.12% eU3O8. Furthermore, Hole EC-09-06 drilled 200 metres north of EC-09-05 and at the same elevation, intersected 2.1 metres at a grade of 0.11% eU3O8.
*Core length
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined.
The equivalent uranium grades are obtained using a spectral probe.
Aside from Hole EC-09-04, which had to be abandoned due to excessive deviation, four holes were drilled on the Eclat property in the first quarter. Hole EC-09-05 proved very revealing, both because it intersected two mineralized zones with particularly strong tourmaline and fuschite alteration, and because of the analytical results for the two zones, which lie 20 metres apart. The zones returned values of 0.16% U3O8 over 2.4 metres and 0.11% U3O8 over 1.5 metres. Hole EC-09-06 intersected a zone of 0.15% U3O8 over 1.5 metres.
The results for holes MT-09-06 and EC-09-05, drilled 200 metres apart with pierce points at the same elevation, clearly indicate the mineral potential of the Matoush fault, which has been traced by drilling over a distance of more than 15 km. This confirms that the deposition mechanisms for the uranium mineralization are not limited to the area of the AM-15 zone.
The similarities between the two mineralized zones in terms of degree of alteration, local presence of pitchblende mineralization in shear zones and proximity to mafic intrusives in the Matoush fault, and the marked similarities of the texture and nature of these mafic intrusives to those found around the mineralized zones, are impressive.
The almost carbon-copy nature of these hydrothermic systems and the reducing agents supports the presence of mineral potential along the entire length of the Matoush fault, and confirms the potential for discovery of new mineralized zones at the Matoush project.
Three holes were drilled on the Eclat Nord property in the third quarter, but with mitigated results. Holes ECN-09-01, 02, 03, drilled on a 150-metre grid about 1.5 km north of the AM-15 zone, intersected the Matoush fault but no mineralization despite the presence of strong alteration.
In the fourth quarter, two holes, EC-09-07 and EC-09-08, were drilled on the Eclat Sud property. Measuring 600 metres and 570 metres long respectively for a total of 1,170 metres, the two holes intercepted the Matoush fault, as well as interesting uranium values. Hole EC-09-07, drilled on section 64+50 S, intersected 7.5 metres grading a weighted average of 0.05% U3O8. Hole EC-09-08, drilled on section 66 + 50 S, intersected two zones, the first 2.5 metres thick grading an average of 0.09% U3O8, and the second 15.5 metres thick grading an average of 0.04% U3O8. The pierce points for the two holes were located about 460 metres below surface.
Item 2.A3: MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY
Location and access
The MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY is located north, west and east of the MATOUSH PROPERTY in the Otish Mountains, in Northern Québec. The property is accessible by helicopter as well as by the winter road that links the Eastmain mine to Témiscamie. Please see Figure 1 at page 7 for the regional location of the property.
Mining Claims
Wholly-owned by the Company, the MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY consists of 198 claims covering 10,503.85 hectares. These mining claims were acquired by the Company in the fall of 2005 and the winter and summer of 2006 to protect the area in the vicinity of the MATOUSH and ECLAT properties. Please see the map of the MATOUSH PROJECT in Figure 2 at page9 for the location of the MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY mining claims.
The northern border of the property is very close to the northern edge of the Otish Basin. The property is broken up by a row of mining claims belonging to Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd.
With the addition of the MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY, the MATOUSH PROJECT as a whole covers 23 kilometres along its north-south axis, intersected by a 900-metre section belonging to Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd (See section Item 2. A.4 PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY below).
Exploration Work and prospecting
During the year 2008, no significant exploration work was conducted on the MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY except for the radiometry and magnetometry survey, which covered most of the property. On the northern portion of the MATOUSH PROJECT, on MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY, exploration work in 2007 consisted in prospection and limited drilling. Prospecting was successful with the identification of an outcropping radioactive zone with 600 to 10,000 cps. Four drill holes were completed in the area for a total of 1,290 metres. Mixed results were obtained, the Matoush fault being laterally displaced.
Three holes were drilled on the same section on the MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY in 2008 for a total of 1,473 metres. The section lies a few hundred metres north of the east-west string of Pacific Bay claims, on what should be the extension of the Matoush fault. However, none of the holes intersected the fault.
The first hole, MT-08-002, was extended to the basement without hitting the Matoush fault. Discordance was seen at a depth of 685 metres down hole. The basement rock consists of alternating granitic material and large laminae of mafic units. Many marginal uranium anomalies were intersected in the basement, the most important being 0.02% U3O8 over 4.0 metres. The subsequent holes, MT-08-006 and MN-08-01, were drilled on the same section and failed to detect the extension of the Matoush fault. No radiometry anomalies were detected.
Exploration work in 2009 on the Matoush Extension property was limited to prospecting in the summer.
Item 2A.4: PACIFIC BAY - MATOUSH PROPERTY
Location and access
The PACIFIC-BAY MATOUSH PROPERTY is located in the Otish Mountains in northern Quebec, about 40 km south-west of the MATOUSH PROPERTY. The Property comprises an area of 145 square kilometres (56 square miles) in the Otish Mountains where the Company has been drilling the Matoush high-grade uranium ore body. See Figure 2 for location of this property on the map of the MATOUSH PROJECT.
Mining claims
On January 14, 2008, the Company and Consolidated Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd. (now called Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd.) (“Pacific Bay”) executed a definitive agreement with an effective date of October 29, 2007 whereby the Company can earn a 60% interest in 277 Pacific Bay mineral claims representing 14,576.33 hectares located in the Matoush District of Québec's Otish Mountains.
The agreement calls for the Company: (i) to pay to Pacific Bay a total of $500,000; (ii) to issue 200,000 common shares of the Company over 4 years and (iii) to incur $3 million in exploration expenditures over 4 years, including a minimum of 10,000 metres of drilling. As part of the transaction, the Company has acquired one (1) million units of Pacific Bay at a price of $0.30 per unit. Each unit consists of one common share of Pacific Bay and one warrant to purchase one common share of Pacific Bay at $0.60 per share for a period of 24 months. The shares and warrants were subject to a 12-month resale restriction period that expired on January 14, 2009.
On October 22, 2009, the Company notified Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd. (“Pacific Bay”) that it had incurred cumulative exploration expenses of $1.5 million before the date of the second anniversary of the option and joint venture agreement dated October 29, 2007, and completed more than the required cumulative minimum of 5,000 metres of drilling on the Pacific-Bay Matoush property.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company also issued 40,000 common shares at $0.86 per share to Pacific Bay on that date, as well as a cash payment of $100,000.
To acquire an undivided 60% interest in the Pacific Bay-Matoush property, the Company must still issue a total of 120,000 common shares, make cash payments totalling $300,000, incur an additional $1.5 million in exploration expenses and complete an additional 5,000 metres of drilling before the fourth anniversary of the date of the agreement.
Exploration work
Since October 29, 2007, the Company assumed direction of exploration activities on the PACIFIC BAY -MATOUSH PROPERTY. The Company is working closely with Pacific Bay field personnel to maximize the value of the exploration programs.
Four holes were drilled with the help of a Versadrill helicopter-borne drill (Major Drilling) between October 31 and November 25, 2007 for a total of 1,061 metres. These holes are all located in the southern block of the Rabbit Ears claims about 10 km north-east of the MATOUSH PROPERTY camp. These holes were drilled in an area of the property with favourable geophysical anomalies such as magnetic lineaments and airborne radiometric anomalies, as well as VLF/EM conductors. Uranium-bearing boulders have also been discovered in the area during prospecting in the summer of 2007.
Drilling on the Rabbit Ears south block intersected the two same types of sedimentary facies seen in the Matoush sector. These correspond to the active channel facies (ACF) an arkosic to subarkosic conglomeritic coarse sandstone, and the channel-bar facies (CBF), a finely laminated subarkosic fine-to-medium sandstone, of the Indicator Formation. The vertical hole, PB-07-01, confirmed a sub-horizontal bedding in this area of the basin. The best hole was PB-07-05 which intersected a 10 cm altered sandstone averaging 0.03% eU3O8 .
Early August 2008, the Company started diamond drilling of uranium targets on the PACIFIC BAY - MATOUSH PROPERTY. The 1,500-metre program followed intensive ground prospecting and geological work, focused on the South Rabbit Ears claims, where outcrops, in situ radiometric anomalies, and radioactive boulder trains strongly suggest the potential of Matoush-type uranium mineralization.
Seven holes totalling 1,510 metres were drilled on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY. The holes were drilled between August 8 and September 7, 2008 using a helicopter-transportable drill (Versa drill). The holes were drilled in the “Rabbit Ears South” sector, about 5 km east of the AM-15 zone. The targets were established for the purpose of identifying a Matoush-type uranium mineralized zone, based on the results of prospecting done in 2007 and 2008, geophysical surveys and the geomorphology study done by Poly-Géo Inc. in 2008.
Two sectors were tested (see Company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com for details). Five holes were drilled on Sector 1 to trace a potentially-mineralized north-south fault similar to Matoush. The holes covered an east-west lateral distance of 630 m to a vertical depth of about 300 m. Sector 2, where two holes were drilled for a total of 596 metres, lies about 700 metres directly south of Sector 1. The goal was to test for the presence of a geophysical lineament interpreted as having a similar slip to that of the Matoush fault.
No significant mineralization was intersected during this drilling program. However, ACF and CBF layers with the same alternation as those at MATOUSH PROPERTY were encountered. From a structural perspective, no major faults comparable to the Matoush fault were intersected by drilling. Nevertheless, several highly-fractured to sub-brecciated zones were seen in five holes, and potential remains for the discovery of a uranium-bearing structure. The fractured zones seen in the holes do not appear to be large enough to explain the geophysical lineaments in the sectors drilled..
In the first quarter of 2009, five holes were drilled to test for a major structure like the Matoush fault in the “Rabbit Ears South” area on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY. Hole PB-09-02 proved to be of particular interest, intersecting a major clay-rich breccia structure several metres thick. Despite the absence of mineralization and of the mafic dikes characteristic of the Matoush fault, the presence of this strongly brecciated structure indicates potential for the discovery of a structure similar to the Matoush fault. This area lies 10 km east of the Matoush fault.
Following the completion of drilling on the Mistassini property in late June 2009, the Company took advantage of the availability of the helicopter-borne drill to drill a 200-metre hole on a section of the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY, which consists of four mining claims in the possible extension of the Matoush fault, 3 km south of the Eclat property. The presence of the Matoush fault was confirmed by drilling in April 2008 less than 200 metres from the southern border of the Eclat property with a property belonging to Cameco Corporation (“Cameco”).
In the third quarter of 2009, seven holes were drilled on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY, but the results were inconclusive. Four holes were drilled to trace the Matoush fault, which becomes diffuse north of the Eclat Nord property. No remarkable structures were identified. Three holes were drilled to test a linear geophysical anomaly on the “Rabbit Ears” area, about 3 km east of the AM-15 zone, but failed to locate any structures of note. Work ended on the property in September.
Report and recommendation preparation began in the fourth quarter of 2009, to determine future work to be done on the PACIFIC BAY-MATOUSH PROPERTY.
Item 2A.5: PERMITS AND LICENCE
In May 2007, the company retained Golder Associates to begin various environmental baseline studies that were completed in the summer of 2008. Since November 2007, Melis Engineering is conducting at the Lakefield laboratory in Ontario, Canada, metallurgical testing on the AM-15 zone ore. Initial results indicated that 98% recovery can be achieved and that the ore does not generate acid or contain arsenic. Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (“Scott Wilson RPA”) has been retained for underground design work. A call for tenders has been completed and a mining contractor has been retained for the work once the authorizations have been obtained. About 100 people are currently assigned to the project on a permanent basis. The Company invested about $25 million in the MATOUSH PROJECT in the year 2006-2007, the budget for 2008 was of $22 million and of $15M for the year 2009.
In April 2008, the Company received permission to begin the process of obtaining the authorizations required to proceed with underground exploration at its MATOUSH uranium PROJECT. The Company notified the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ("CNSC") and Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment Parks (“MSDEP”) Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement et des Parcs by written "letter of intent" of its intention to begin the process of obtaining the permits required for planned underground exploration work. In the context of a feasibility study, this work will essentially consist of site preparation, excavation of an access ramp to the -300-metre level, and the excavation of exploration drifts for definition drilling.
Excavation will take place in waste rock and ore. The exploration work will also allow assessment of the quantity and processing of mine water, ventilation, mining methods and ore stockpiling.
The following tables demonstrate as of December 31, 2009, the authorizations, licenses and permits either already obtained, pending or to be obtained before the Company can start the underground exploration works:
By obtaining such authorizations, the Company will become the first company in the Province of Quebec, Canada to advance a uranium exploration project to the underground exploration stage, and the first so-called junior company to do so in the present uranium price cycle, or in nearly 25 years.
With regard to the environmental impact study, the Company received guidelines from the Evaluating Committee (COMEV), the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and from the CNSC in March 2009 pursuant to the filing of the Project Description in July 2008.
Following filing on November 5th, 2008, of the Licence Application to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for the underground exploration program and following the comments received from the CNSC in February 2009, the Company continued its detailed engineering plans and field work related to the environmental impact study.
In addition to the mandates awarded to Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. for the underground pumping and ventilation studies and to Melis Engineering Ltd. for finalization of the mine runoff treatment plan, contracts were granted to Golder for various studies and health and safety programs.
Golder carried out fieldwork in a number of disciplines in the winter of 2009. Most of these activities were related to work plans approved in 2008. Field activities for animal counts were completed in January and February.
The winter surface water and sediment sampling program, hydrology and geochemistry work were completed in March 2009.
The ramp stability rock mechanics study was started in the first quarter of 2009. The study is aimed at meeting Québec regulatory requirements for excavations within 100 metres of a body of water, and responding to CNSC requirements.
In February 2009, GENIVAR carried out supervision work for the construction of the new fuel storage area, as well as design work for a cement base for a new communications antenna.
In March 2009, GENIVAR was awarded a contract for the detailed engineering of the facilities required for exploration ramp construction. This contract essentially consists of the detailed engineering for the treatment plant for water from the exploration ramp, portal, power grid, power supply, ventilation system, fuel and propane distribution system, camp expansion and approval applications, all new surface facilities, civil works and a landing strip.
As in the first quarter of 2009, the Company continued work on the various studies in preparation for the underground exploration program, which will begin once the Company has obtained all the required permits.
Two other consultants, SENES Consultants Limited (SENES) and the Montreal office of GENIVAR, joined the list of the Company’s many consultants conducting the various detailed studies required to obtain the various provincial and federal permits in Canada.
Following up on the comments received from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) on February 16, 2009, in relation to the underground exploration licence application, the Company began field works with the assistance of Golder Associates Ltd. (“Golder”) for a geo-mechanical study on the crown pillar. The Company will use the same study to comply with Quebec provincial government requirements regarding an underground excavation under the influence of a water body, meaning when an excavation is less than 100 m from a water body. Field works consisted of the drilling of three holes and various tests performed in the holes and on the drill core in an area totalling 526 metres.
GENIVAR of Val-d’Or and Amos continued to work on the detailed engineering of the surface facilities required for underground exploration.
Environmental work by Golder continues, with the drafting of the “terms of reference (baseline)” for most of the study components, including hydrogeology, surface and sediment water quality, fish and fish habitats and wildlife. The writing of the geochemistry report, updating of the hydrogeology report and drafting of the restoration plan were also among the activities that took place during the quarter.
Phase 2 of the drafting of detailed procedures and manuals for the radioprotection program is progressing as planned.
With the drafting of the base studies nearing completion, Golder was able to begin studying the potential impact of the exploration project on the physical and biological components on which they are working.
The Company awarded a new contract to Golder for the preparation of an environmental emergency measures plan from April to June 2009.
SENES, an Ontario firm with extensive experience in the uranium industry received the mandates to conduct Risk studies (ecological risk, risk on human health and industrial risk) and the air and climate and radiometry studies.
The field works carried out by Golder between April and June 2009 consisted of a spring sampling program of surface and sediment water and geochemistry (work plan approved in 2008).
SENES provided training to Company personnel and set up air sampling stations on site. They also carried out a surface radiometry survey for the baseline radioactivity study.
Various health and safety programs were prepared, including radioprotection, emergency measures, occupational safety and industrial hygiene, which are only a few of the many programs required as demonstrated in the following table. The Company completed all these programs by the end of September 2009.
LICENCE
In April 2008, the Company received authorization to begin the process of obtaining the approvals required for an underground exploration program at its Matoush uranium project.
The Company advised the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment Parks (MSDEP) by letter of intent of its intention to begin the process of obtaining the permits required to begin underground exploration work. As described supra in this section A5. PERMITS AND LICENCE,, in the context of a feasibility study, this work would essentially consist of site preparation, excavation of an access ramp to the -300 metre level, and the excavation of exploration drifts to carry out definition drilling. Excavation would take place in waste rock and ore. The exploration work would also allow assessment of the quantity and processing of mine drainage, ventilation, mining methods and ore storage.
Once it receives the required authorizations, the Company will become the first company in Quebec and the first so-called junior company in Canada in this uranium cycle, or nearly 25 years, to advance a uranium exploration project to the underground exploration stage.
On July 15, 2008, as part of the underground exploration via ramp program, the Company presented its Preliminary Project Description to the CNSC, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and the MSDEP for comments. The Preliminary Project Description for the underground exploration program included: the project components, metallurgy, mine drainage, the health and safety program, and 15 separate appendices on environmental assessment, the water treatment plant, metallurgical testing, the project timetable, etc.
Comments were received on August 21, 2008, from those in charge of the file at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, and the Company provided the required information in mid-September 2008.
The Company was then told that instructions and comments would be issued by the Evaluating Committee (COMEV), which is responsible for large projects in the James Bay area of Quebec.
On November 5, 2008, the Company filed an application for an underground exploration permit for its MATOUSH uranium PROPERTY with the CNSC. This application is part of the project authorization process, which began on July 15, 2008 with the filing of the Preliminary Project Description to the CNSC, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and the MSDEP. This document describing the underground exploration program can be found on the Company’s website (www.stratecoinc.com) and on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).
The upgrading of the Eastmain winter road to an all-season road became essential. Consequently, permit applications were filed in the fall of 2008 for construction of a permanent one-lane gravel road for year-round supply of equipment and fuel to the MATOUSH PROJECT. This link will also substantially reduce the costs associated with the underground exploration program.
In February 2009, the Company received comments from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regarding the licence application filed on November 4th, 2008, for the underground exploration work.
The Operations and Engineering department was very productive in 2009. Multiple reports required for the underground exploration program were completed and submitted to the regulatory authorities.
An important step was made toward obtaining the licence and various permits in the first quarter of 2009. Comments were received from the CNSC on February 16, 2009, in relation to the licence application filed on November 5, 2008. The Company also received the COMEV directive on March 19, 2009, for the environmental impact study.
Following receipt of the COMEV directive and CNSC comments, many activities were carried out by various consultants for the permits required for the underground exploration program. In addition to the mandates awarded to Scott Wilson RPA for the underground pumping and ventilation studies, and to Melis Engineering Ltd. for finalization of the mine runoff treatment plan, contracts were granted to Golder Associates (“Golder”) for various studies and health and safety programs.
Golder carried out field work in a number of disciplines in the winter of 2009. Most of these activities were related to work plans approved in 2008. Field activities for animal counts were completed in January and February 2009. The winter surface water and sediment sampling program, hydrology and geochemistry work were completed in March 2009.
In February, the borrow pits (gravel, sand and till) on the Matoush property were drilled by the Amos office of GENIVAR and Poly-Geo Inc. to outline the sources of borrow material for the construction of surface facilities required for the exploration ramp. The Amos office of GENIVAR also carried out supervision work for the construction of the new fuel storage area, as well as design work for a cement base for a new communications antenna.
The ramp stability rock mechanics study was also started in the first quarter of 2009. The study is aimed at meeting Quebec regulatory requirements for excavations within 100 metres of a body of water, at the request of the CNSC.
In March 2009, GENIVAR was awarded a contract for the detailed engineering of the facilities required for exploration ramp construction. This contract essentially consists of the detailed engineering for the treatment plant for exploration ramp runoff, portal, power grid, power supply, ventilation system, fuel and propane distribution system, camp expansion and approval applications for all new surface facilities, civil works and a landing strip.
In the second quarter, two other consultants, SENES Consultants Limited (“SENES”), an Ontario firm with extensive uranium industry experience, and the Montreal office of GENIVAR, joined the list of the many consultants conducting the various detailed studies required to obtain the various provincial and federal permits.
Following up on the comments received from the CNSC on February 16, 2009, in relation to the underground exploration licence application, the Company began field work with the assistance of Golder for a rock mechanics study on the crown pillar. This study will also be used to meet provincial government requirements regarding an underground excavation under the influence of a water body, meaning when an excavation is less than 100 m from a water body. Field work consisted of the drilling of three holes and various tests performed in the holes and on the drill core. A total of 526 metres were drilled.
In the second quarter, the Val-d’Or and Amos offices of GENIVAR continued to work on the detailed engineering of the surface facilities required for the underground exploration program.
With the completion of the baseline studies, Golder was able to begin studying the potential impact of the exploration project on the physical and biological components on which they were working. Phase 2 of the drafting of detailed procedures and manuals for the radioprotection program was also completed. A new contract was also awarded to Golder for the preparation of an environmental emergency measures plan. Field work carried out by Golder between April and June 2009 consisted of a spring sampling program of surface and sediment water and geochemistry (work plan approved in 2008).
In the second quarter, risk studies (ecological risk, risk on human health and industrial risk) were also awarded to SENES, along with mandates for the air and climate and radiometry studies. SENES provided training to Company personnel and set up air sampling stations on site. They also carried out a surface radiometry survey for the baseline radioactivity study.
Throughout the second quarter, the Company received a number of provincial permits for the Matoush project, including the land use lease for the camp and the petroleum equipment operating permit (renewal) in April, and in June, the exemption of the landing strip from the impact study and the environmental and social impact review.
In the third quarter, the environmental work done by Golder continued, with the preparation of baseline assessments for most of the study components, including hydrogeology based on the field rock mechanics results, surface water and sediment quality, hydrology and wildlife. Activities for the quarter also included the preparation and submission of the geochemistry and rehabilitation reports and the environmental emergency response plan. The field work carried out by Golder from July to September 2009 was part of the summer program of surface water and sediments sampling and geotechnical drilling of the crown pillar.
Meanwhile, SENES completed analysis and drafting of the risk study (ecological, human health and industrial risk) in the third quarter, and filed the preliminary report on the ecological and human health risks in September for review. The drafting of the baseline assessment for air quality, the climate and radiometry continued during the quarter, and the final report on air quality and climate was completed in early October.
The crown pillar geotechnical study was completed and the final report was received. Furthermore, most of the studies were completed, including the radiation safety study, a high priority element for the permit application.
In addition, the Val-d’Or and Amos offices of GENIVAR completed the detailed engineering work and started construction engineering.
In the third quarter, the Company received some of the permits required for the Matoush project development, such as the land usage rights for the landing strip and related access road, as well as the access roads to some of the borrow pits. Timber cutting rights were also granted.
The last quarter of 2009 was very busy due to two major applications. The environmental impact study was completed and sent to the regulatory authorities in October 2009, and the application for a licence for underground exploration work was filed with the CNSC on November 6. The latter application contains a dozen programs and a significant number of sub-programs, all related to occupational health and safety and the environment.
The Company also filed an updated preliminary rehabilitation plan as requested by the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune (“MRNF”).
The Company filed two exemption requests in November with the Ministère du Développement durable de l’Environnement et des Parcs (“MDDEP”), one for the use of the winter road to the Matoush camp, and the other for the exploitation of a sand pit smaller than 3 hectares (ha).
The Company filed a request for an authorization to mine without a lease for eight borrow pits smaller than 3 ha on the property. The material is required to pursue surface exploration work, repair the site access and build the landing strip.
Finally, a request for an authorization certificate to mine six borrow pits larger than 3 ha was filed with the regional MDDEP office in Rouyn-Noranda. This material is required for future underground exploration work.
Golder also finalised its limited impact study document. No field work took place between October and December 2009. The final Golder and SENES documents to be included in the overall underground exploration project impact study were submitted.
Finally, numerous translation contracts were granted in the last quarter of 2009 to comply with Quebec government requirements.
Community and Investor Relations
Throughout 2009, the Company continued to strengthen communications with the First Nations to inform them on the various stages of the MATOUSH PROJECT development. A technical presentation on mineral exploration was made to five representatives of the Grand Council of the Crees and two representatives of the Cree Mineral Exploration Board at the Company’s head office on February 10, 2009. This working session proved excellent, enabling those present to be well informed and to obtain clear answers to their questions and concerns.
An official meeting was held at the site on February 21, 2009. Twenty-three of the 26 participants were Cree, including four tallymen responsible of the trap lines in the Matoush project area. A similar meeting took place at the same time last year. Because they are directly on site, these meetings generate more dialogue.
Company management made two presentations, one to the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune and the other to the deputy minister of mines and his entourage. A third presentation was made in Chibougamau to the MNA for Ungava.
These presentations and exchanges had two specific goals: to publicize the Matoush project overall, particularly its development stages, and to inform the main stakeholders on the various aspects of uranium, particularly potential concerns such as radioactivity, radon, health and safety and environmental protection.
In early April, the Company was an active participant and a major sponsor of the fourth annual Learning Together conference in Montreal, which brings together aboriginal communities from across Canada. Among other things, this conference aims to create strong links between First Nations communities and the mining industry. It allowed the Company to address questions from many participant on uranium projects. The presentations and the participation of a Company representative in discussion groups that included representatives from Cameco and the CNSC proved very beneficial.
On April 21, a meeting was held with the chief of the Mistassini band council to discuss the progress of the Matoush project, as well as the work remaining for the preparation of the underground exploration program.
At the end of April, a Company representative also met with the members of the Uranium Committee in Chibougamau to provide support in terms of the planning process and strategy for public meetings. This new committee has been set up by the board of directors of the regional committee of CREBJ for the purpose of informing the public on all aspects of uranium in an open, transparent process.
In addition to its various meetings, the Company retained the services of consultants to optimize its website in 2009. The website provides access to a broad range of information on the nature and characteristics of the MATOUSH PROJECT, the health and safety of the local population and workers and environmental protection. The website now also has pages on “News to Investors” and “News to the Communities” that provide up to the minute news on the MATOUSH PROJECT. Anyone interested can, for instance, consult the latest resource estimate or be notified of the most recent information document uploads. The site also provides new information files on interesting subjects related to uranium, such as environmental protection, transport, site restoration and health and safety programs. The site was updated out of a concern for transparency, so that the public, investors and anyone else interested in the project could find answers to questions they might have.
In the third and fourth quarter, to maintain direct contact with investors, the president and chief executive officer travelled to Europe three times and made several trips to Toronto and Montreal, where he attended numerous meetings to maintain direct contact with investors. He also gave media interviews, notably on Canal Argent, to inform investors and the public on MATOUSH PROJECT developments.
These initiatives show that the Company is pursuing its efforts to establish and maintain good relations and open, ongoing communications with local communities, the Cree community, investors, regulatory authorities and the general public.
In 2010, the Company plans to begin the environmental studies required for mill and tailings pond construction. These studies are required to obtain a mine construction permit.
Item 2 B. MISTASSINI PROPERTY
Location and access
The Mistassini property consists of 171 claims shown on the NTS32P map for a total area of 9,114.47 hectares (91.15 km2). It is located in the Otish Mountains approximately 40 km south-west of the Matoush property wholly-owned by the Company. Please see Regional Location Map Figure 1 at page 7 for the location of the property and Figure 3 below for the location of the claims:
Mining Claims
Pursuant to the letter of intent dated November 20, 2007 and following receipt of analyses for three holes drilled by Majescor Resources Inc. (“Majescor”) in December 2007 on the Lac Mantouchiche uranium prospect, the Company decided on February 14, 2008, to exercise its option right to acquire an option to earn an undivided 60% interest in Majescor’s uranium rights and uranium only on the MISTASSINI PROPERTY.
The Option Agreement provides for the Company to acquire a 60% interest in the uranium rights on the property by carrying out a total of $1.3 million in exploration expenditures over three years. The Company reimbursed Majescor for the cost of the drilling program completed in December 2007 and spent additional sums in exploration expenses on the property for a total firm commitment of $500,000 in Year 1 of the option. The remaining $800,000 in exploration expenses will be spent equally between Years 2 and 3.
During the option period, the Company will be the sole operator for all uranium exploration and will have full access to the property. Northern Superior Resources Inc., which holds 100% of the diamond rights and 50.5% of all other mineral rights to the exception of diamonds and uranium rights, renounced to conduct exploration and exploitation works for diamonds on the property during the duration of the Agreement. Furthermore, Northern Superior Resources Inc. is entitled to a 2.0% Yellow Cake Royalty on the uranium rights of the property.
The MISTASSINI PROPERTY consisted originally at the time of the letter of intent of 721 mining claims covering 391 km2. On November 3, 2008, the Company gave a 90 days notice to Majescor that it was no more interested to pursue exploration on 550 claims. As of November 24, 2008, Majescor and the Company executed a definitive agreement with an effective date of February 14, 2008. The Company maintained its option to acquire a 60% interest in the remaining 171 claims covering an area of 9,114.71 hectares.
On or about February 14, 2009, the Company had met its obligations of the First Anniversary of the Option Agreeement in spending more than $500,000 on exploration expenses on the Mistassini Property
Exploration work
The discovery hole drilled in 2002 by Majescor (MIST 02-08) on the MISTASSINI PROPERTY had intersected 0.20% U3O8 over 4.50 metres.
In December 2007, three holes were drilled by Majescor to verify the extension down dip of Lac Mantouchiche uranium prospect. The best intersection was obtained in Hole MIST-07-03, with 18.5 -metre grading 0.215% U3O8 near-surface.
The Company began late February 2008, a comprehensive exploration program, which included drilling aimed at confirming the strike and dip extensions of the Lac Mantouchiche uranium prospect, as well as detailed ground mapping and prospecting.
The potential of the property as a whole was assessed primarily on the basis of geophysical data. In this regard, magnetic susceptibility data combined with systematic core radiometric data have shown a clear inverse correlation between uranium grade and magnetism. These observations strongly suggest that low magnetic zones could be used to target regional exploration on the property. The use of other geophysical surveys, such as detailed gravity and VLF-EM over the uranium discovery will also be evaluated.
As a precursor to the drilling program planned for 2009, the Company started in December 2008 and completed on January 23, 2009, a 1,869 line-kilometre helicopter-borne geophysical survey over the Mistassini property.
This technical data has been approved by Jean-Pierre Lachance, P.Geo., Executive Vice President of Strateco Resources Inc., a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101.
As of June 2009, the Companyand Majescor Resources Inc.("Majescor”) began a drilling program at Majescor’s MISTASSINI PROPERTY. The MISTASSINI PROPERTY is host to the Lac Mantouchiche uranium showing where Majescor drilled an 18.5 -metre intersection grading 0.215% U3O8 near-surface in Hole MIST-07-03. The property is located in the Otish Mountains, 50 km southwest of the Company’s MATOUSH PROPERTY.
The principal objective of the 600 m drilling program, started in early June 2009, was to begin testing the strike and dip extensions of the Lac Mantouchiche uranium prospect. This drilling program was based on a target zone identified from a 1,200 line-kilometre helicopter-borne geophysical survey completed over the MISTASSINI PROPERTY for the Company in January 2009. Fugro Airborne Surveys Corp. carried out the survey.
The high resolution magnetic and electromagnetic survey was interpreted by Jeremy S. Brett of MPH Consulting Ltd, and identified an ESE-WNW trending km-scale structural lineament, coincident with the Lac Mantouchiche uranium showing. Drilling completed to date at the MISTASSINI PROPERTY, together with recently outlined geophysical targets, confirm the uranium mineralisation potential of the basement rocks near surface. The MISTASSINI PROPERTY lies along the Otish sedimentary basin’s proposed SW extension axis to the Papaskwasati basin, in the vicinity of a major basement fold axis. The Mantouchiche sedimentary outlier is entirely confined within the limits of the property, near the main uranium prospect.
As of July 2009 the Companyand Majescor obtainedthe preliminary results of a drill program recently completed on the Mistassini uranium property held by Majescor and located in the Otish Mountains of Quebec, 50 km southwest of the Company’s MATOUSHPROPERTY.
A new uranium-bearing zone was intersected in the immediate vicinity of the Lac Mantouchiche uranium showing (“Mantouchiche showing”). Drill hole MIST-09-03, drilled at -45°, intersected 11.0 metres grading 0.13% eU3O8 , including 0.9 metre at a grade of 1.03% eU3O8 . This new uraniferous zone is located in the hanging wall of the Mantouchiche showing, at a vertical depth of 32 metres. The Mantouchiche showing discovery hole, MIST-07-03, drilled an angle of -70° along the same section as hole MIST-09-03, had intersected 18.5 metres grading 0.215% U3O8 , at a vertical depth of 47 metres.
A second drill hole, MIST-09-04, drilled along the same section at -70°, confirmed the vertical extension of the new uranium-bearing zone, with an intercept of 13.9 metres grading 0.08% eU3O8 at a vertical depth of 40 metres, including a sub-intercept of 5.1 metres grading 0.186% eU3O8. The latter hole did not reach the extension of the Mantouchiche showing, inferred to be at about 170 metres vertical depth. The extension of the Mantouchiche showing was however intersected in drill hole MIST-09-03 at a vertical depth of 64 metres, with an intercept of 3.0 metres grading 0.08% eU3O8 including 0.14% eU3O8 over 1.2metres.
The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined. The equivalent uranium grades are obtained using a spectral probe. Analytical results are pending.
The drilling campaign on the MISTASSINI PROPERTY took place on a period of 18 days in June 2009. Seven holes were completed for a total of 786 metres.
The drill holes tested three areas in the immediate vicinity of the Mantouchiche showing, over a total strike length of 125 metres. Two drill holes were completed per section to test the strike extensions namely 50 metres to the west and 75 metres to the east of the Mantouchiche showing. Drill holes MIST-09-01, 02, 05 and 06, drilled to this end, intersected anomalous eU3O8 values. Drill holes MIST-09-03 and 04 were drilled along the same section as the discovery hole MIST-07-03. The strike extension of the new zone could not be confirmed by the last hole in the campaign, namely MIST-09-07, drilled along the same section as MIST-09-05 and 06.
Given the positive results of the drill campaign and following a structural and geological interpretation, further exploration work will be carried-out over the coming year. At first, a ground geophysical survey will be conducted to test for the possible presence of high-grade uranium lenses preferentially aligned along a north-south axis.
Item 2 C. APPLE PROPERTY
Location and access
The property is located at 80 km southeast of Radisson, in the James Bay area in the Province of Quebec in Canada. The property is accessible by a 40 km winter road from Km 510 on the paved James Bay road. In summer, the property can be accessed by boat from the Trans-Taïga road. Float planes and helicopters are readily available in the city of Radisson. Please see Figure 1 at page 7 for the general location of the property.
Mining claims
The APPLE PROPERTY consists of 194 mining claims covering 9,928.13 hectares recorded in the name of the Company.
On August 28, 2007, the Company has acquired 100% the Apple uranium property, wholly owned by Virginia Mines Inc (“Virginia”) in consideration of 3,250,000 common shares of the Company.
The agreement also provided for a 2% NSR royalty payable upon production to Virginia, half of which can be bought back by the Company for $1.0 million. The transaction closed on September 6, 2007.
Figure 4 below represents the location of the claims for APPLE PROPERTY:
Uranium potential
The project covers a portion of the Apple Formation, which came to light in the early 1970s with the discovery of several extensive uranium-pyrite matrix, quartz pebble conglomerate zones.
The Apple uranium deposit was in fact discovered in 1971 during an airborne survey. The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited (“INCO”) and James Bay Development Corporation subsequently conducted an extensive joint exploration program from 1972 to 1975, with INCO as the operator. A total of 65 holes were drilled for a total of 14,000 metres, and the uranium conglomerates were traced over a distance of eight kilometres along an east-west axis.
Exploration work
From 1972 to 1975 Canadian Nickel Company (Canico) drilled 66 holes for a total of 14,445 metres on Apple in order to evaluate the uranium potential. In the end of 1974, Canico completed a historical grade and tonnage estimate in all categories of 9,365,000 tons grading 0.054% U3O8. Their resource estimate was prepared only for a strike length of approximately 1,000 m and to a depth of approximately 300 m; the mineralized horizon remaining opened at depth.
Cautionary Note: A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The Company does not consider resources or reserves of an historical estimate to be mineral resources or mineral reserves, as these categories are defined in articles 1.2 and 1.3 of the National Instrument 43-101, as amended. The investor or reader should not rely upon this historical estimate.
In 2006, Virginia completed a helicopter-borne, combined magnetic and radiometric orientation survey over most of the actual property. The strongest radiometric anomalies were found to have a direct correspondence to the area drilled by Canico form 1972 to 1975.
On August 23, 2007, two Company’s representatives visited the property as part of a due diligence process, accompanied by two representatives of Virginia and guided by Mr. Jean-François Ouellette of Geonordic Technical Services Inc. and Mr. Michel Gauthier, Ph.D., a Professor at UQAM and Liège University in Belgium. Mr. Gauthier is very familiar with the geological context of the APPLE PROPERTY and has extensive experience in the uranium of the James Bay region, having been involved there since the 1970s.
During the field visit, two outcrops 2.9 km apart belonging to the same Apple Formation were seen. The strength and size of the system were also witnessed.
The second outcrop, which corresponded to the radiometry anomaly that led to the Apple discovery, is exposed over about 75 metres along strike. Readings from a few thousand to 10,000 counts per second were taken during the visit. The Company has for objective to substantially increase the existing estimated resource of about 9.0 million pounds of U3O8 in considering that the prospection unit (Apple Formation) was traced for nearly 14.0 km while the resources calculated by Canico were limited to 1.0 km.
In the fall of 2007, the Company conducted a helicopter-borne radiometry survey covering the entire property. This survey led to the identification of new radiometry anomalies and confirmed those identified by earlier surveys.
In early January 2008, the Company began construction of a 14-person camp. Drilling began as soon as construction was completed in mid-February. Various targets were to be tested.
On the APPLE PROPERTY, an initial drilling program totalling 4,000 metres started. The 2008 budget for this property was of $2.3 million. Five twin holes covered a strike length of 1.1 km where the resource had been estimated by Inco, most of the program tested new radiometry anomalies identified by the helicopter-borne survey conducted by the Company in the fall of 2007.
From February to April 2008, 13 holes totalling 3,357 metres were drilled on the property, including four holes to twin Canico’s intersection and five holes to infill along the Apple trend. The holes completed by the Company were successful confirming the lateral and vertical continuity of the uranium mineralization within the Apple Formation.
As of March 2008, five holes totalling 1,668 metres had been completed. The first four holes (AP-08-01 to 04: 1,413 metres) were drilled near old holes drilled by INCO in the 1970s (twin holes) to confirm the geology and verify the mineralized zones intersected by the old holes, drilled over a linear distance of one kilometre. The casings of the twinned holes were located on the property.
In the four twinned holes totalling 1,413 metres (AP-08-01 to 04), the main geological units intersected are the same and in virtually the same position as those shown on INCO’s drill sections (GM57894). There is also good correlation between the conglomerate beds identified by INCO and those seen in the 2008 holes. The conglomerate beds are where they were expected to be with similar grades. The grades and thicknesses obtained by INCO and those for the 2008 twin holes were correlated once the assay results had been received.
The results of these first four holes provided the basis under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) for the technical report dated June 2, 2008 entitled: Technical Report on the Apple Project, James Bay Area, Northwestern Québec, Canada prepared for Strateco Resources Inc. NI 43-101 Report prepared by R. Barry Cook, M.Sc., P.Eng. and Paul Chamois, M.Sc., P.Geo. of Scott Wison Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA).
Scott Wilson RPA was of the opinion that the Company’s Apple Project merited considerably more uranium exploration and a substantial work program was recommended. Scott Wilson RPA recommended work on the Phase I program, beginning as soon as practical in early summer 2008 and continuing through winter 2009. The Phase I program included: i) line cutting and ground geophysical surveys (magnetics, radiometrics, Induced Polarization (IP)) and geological mapping along the main Apple trend, ii) prospecting and sampling along the main Apple trend and investigating airborne radiometric anomalies elsewhere, and iii) diamond drilling primarily along the main Apple trend with a proposed budget of $4,176,000.
According to Scott Wilson RPA, a Phase II program were envisioned to begin in early summer 2009 and to consist of first pass definition drilling in the most attractive areas. Advancing to Phase II with a proposed budget of $6,011,000 would be however contingent upon positive results from Phase I.
Five holes totalling 1,263 metres (AP-08-05, 10, 11, 12 and 13) were drilled to verify the lateral extensions of the mineralized zones surrounded by Canico for the resource estimate done between the 4, 400 West and 1,100 West sections. To the exception of hole AP-08-13 drilled on the 4,000 West section, the other holes the Company drilled east of the 1,100 West section over a lateral distance of 790 metres, with an average spacing of 150 metres between holes, with the exception of hole most to the east, AP-08-10, distant of 370 metres with hole AP-08-11. (The 4.400 West and 1,100 West Sections can be seen on the Company’s website at www.stratecoinc.com.
Among those four holes, only Hole AP-08-10 did not intersect uranium mineralization. Hole AP-08-05 centered on an important radiometric anomaly, turned out to be conclusive with the intersection of three mineralized zones measuring from 3.7 metres to 7.1 metres in length with an average grade of 0.03% U3O8.
Holes AP-08-11 and AP-08-12 have each intersected two mineralized zones of an average length of 3.5 metres with grades oscillating between 0.02 and 0.06% U3O8 The best intersection was 0.06% U3O8 over 4.0metres in hole AP-08-12.
Hole AP-08-13 drilled on the 4,400 West section intersected the mineralization on thickness of 2.5 and 3.6 metres with an average grade of 0.04% U3O8.
The four other holes for a total of 710 metres (AP-08-06 to 09), drilled to investigate certain radiometric anomalies identified by the 2007 airborne survey in the southern portion of the property, did not intersect any significant mineralization.
Exploration work on the Apple property consisted primarily of prospecting, channel sampling and geological reconnaissance carried out on the basis of the results of an airborne radiometry survey conducted in the fall of 2007. The field work took place from June 5 to August 9, 2008.
The geological reconnaissance revealed five main outcrops, each with different anomalous bands generally corresponding to the uranium-bearing quartz pebble/pyrite matrix conglomerate. Subsequent, tighter prospecting of each of the outcropping areas allowed the uranium zones to be precisely traced to determine their morphology, which is primarily controlled by ductile/fragile deformation. Systematic GR-135 spectrometer readings were taken to characterize the various anomalous bands and determine their uranium content.
The Apple uranium-bearing conglomerates were also traced over a distance of nearly 8 km along the northern contact with the Yasinski volcano-sedimentary formation. Many readings were obtained for each outcrop, ranging from a few thousand to up to 10,000 counts per second (“cps”). Four of the five outcrops returned values of 5,000 to 13,000 cps. Some anomalous bands also returned values of up to 20,000 cps. The uranium content of the main Apple band therefore ranges from 0.082% to 0.330% eU3O8 in the richest zones. The average uranium/thorium ratio is about 0.75. Chemical assays have not been received yet.
In addition to having better outlined the Apple formation, the exploration work in this program revealed fold zones in the conglomerate horizons that do not seem to have been identified by earlier work. The presence of these folds could entail the repetition of the uranium bands to the south of and parallel to the main band.
Given the extent of the pyrite-matrix uranium-bearing conglomerates as well as their degree of deformation, a 42 line/km induced polarization survey was performed in mid-August following the geological prospecting program to locate the anomalous conglomerates at depth and identify new drill targets south of the 8-km-long Apple formation.
Preliminary data was received at the end of September 2008 for holes not included in the NI 43-101 report.
In reason of the international financial crisis, the Company has decided not to drill on APPLE PROPERTY during winter 2009 and to concentrate its moneys and efforts on the MATOUSH PROJECT.
The Company did not conduct any exploration work on the Apple property in 2009.
Item 2 D. MONT-LAURIER URANIUM PROPERTY
Location and Access
The MONT-LAURIER URANIUM PROPERTY is located in Pérodeau Township, 40 kilometres northeast of Mont-Laurier, Québec in Canada. The property is easily accessible by paved road from Mont-Laurier.
Please see Figure 1 for the regional map indicating the location of the MONT-LAURIER URANIUM PROPERTY at page 7and the following Figure 5 for the location of the Company’s claims on this property.
Mining Claims
The property consists of 80 claims that cover an area of 4,710.35 hectares. The Company owns a 100% interest in the property, acquired at the end of March 2005.
Uranium Potential
The ground acquired lies within the Cabonga-Mont-Laurier radioactive district of the Grenville geological province. Intensive exploration work was conducted in the area from 1969 to 1981, after Canadian Johns-Manville discovered uranium mineralization in 1967.
The Company’s property covers ground previously held by Mont-Laurier Uranium Mines in the 1970s. The claims block straddles the crest of a northeast-trending anticline and covers the high-potential southern extension of the Tom Dick uranium zones.
The uranium occurs mainly as disseminated uraninite in metamorphosed white pegmatites, as well as in biotite gneiss and impure biotite feldspath quartzites. The paragneiss covers Archean granite gneiss exposed mainly in the eroded windows along the crest of the major northeast-trending anticlinal folds.
Two white pegmatite uranium zones have been identified in the centre-south portion of the ground held by the Company, previously known as the Lac Hanson claims. The largest zone, which is six metres thick and dips 20o to the northwest, has been traced over a distance of 365 metres to the northeast by trenching. The central portion of the Company’s property, on the same axis between the Lac Hanson and the Tom Dick zones, remains virtually unexplored due to the fluvio-glacial overburden.
Exploration Work
The Company initiated exploration work on the MONT-LAURIER URANIUM PROPERTY in the summer and fall of 2006.
First, in mid-June 2006, a helicopter-borne geophysical survey was done over the entire property. The radiometry, Mag and VLF survey was flown along lines spaced at 100 metres, totalling 885 line-kilometres. Various anomalous zones were identified.
The radiometry anomalies, particularly the uranium anomalies, are primarily concentrated along a 200- to 1,000-metre wide, northeast striking band that crosses the entire property. This band of anomalies covers a distance of over 14 kilometres. The two most strongly-anomalous areas are in the north and south of the property.
Following this survey, prospecting was carried out on the most promising areas. This work primarily consisted of scintillometry prospecting over approximately 26 line-kilometres, blasting and collection of 73 samples in the Tom Dick area. Some 11.2 kilometres of line-cutting was done in the Lac Hanson area.
This exploration work resulted in the identification of zones of high radioactivity (many times the background level) in the Tom Dick South, Hanson West and Hanson Centre areas. Occasional readings of over 10,000 cps were seen.
Local outcrop spectrometry measurements (GR-135 spectrometer) confirmed the presence of uranium in association with the target helicopter-borne anomalies. For instance, on an outcrop containing white pegmatite on Tom Dick South, the unit recognized as the host of uranium mineralization showed readings of 1,800 to 2,500 cps. Readings of 2,000 to 10,250 cps were recorded at sites on Hanson West, and 4,800 cps on Hanson Centre.
In 2007, the exploration program on the property consisted essentially of drilling.
From January to March 2007, a 2,614 metres - 32-holes drilling program was completed on Area A, B and C. This is the first program carried by the Company since the staking of the property in 2005 and since the work done by Mont-Laurier Uranium Mines in 1971 and SOQUEM in 1973.
In Area A (Lake Hanson West) the 2007 drilling was aimed at testing this zone on a 100-metre spacing drill grid over 1,000 metres of strike. A series of 28 mostly vertical holes (2,274 metres) were drilled to an average depth of about 81 metres. The key white pegmatite units alternating with granitic gneiss were intersected as expected but the dissemination of uranium-bearing minerals seems greater than expected. Decimetric to metric assayed intervals returned values below 0.05 % U3O8.
In Area B between Hanson West and Tom Dick South, only one hole was drilled and abandoned at 54 metres. Water and logistic problems were encountered.
For the Area C (Tom Dick South) three drill holes totalling 285 metres were completed. Only minor intersections of decimetric width with grades below 0.02% U3O8 were obtained.
Even with the mixed results of the 2007 drilling program, the property still shows various exploration targets but the Company did not conduct any exploration work on this property in 2008 and in 2009 but claims have been renewed. The Company decided to write off this property in the financial statements as of December 31, 2008 as mentioned in Form 10-K for the exercise ended December 31, 2008 at Item 8: Financial Statements of an exploration stage company, Note 8 Deferred expenditures.
Item 2 E. QUÉNONISCA PROPERTY - ZN, PB, CU, AG
The QUÉNONISCA PROPERTY consists of 33 claims for a total area of 1,799 hectares. It lies 180 kilometres northwest of Chibougamau, Québec, Canada.
On February 26, 1996, Altavista Mines Inc. (“Altavista”) obtained an exclusive, irrevocable option from SOQUEM to acquire a 50% undivided interest in the Quénonisca property as consideration for exploration work to be carried out under SOQUEM’s direction for a total of $75,000, plus an undertaking by Altavista to subsequently finance a minimum of $127,500 in exploration work by February 28, 1997. In 1997, stripping and drilling were carried out on the property. In 1998, three sulfide occurrences in stockworks were discovered on the Montagnes-Nord grid by SOQUEM.
In 1999, SOQUEM carried out a linear 19.6 line-kilometre magnetometer and Max-Min survey on the Montagnes-Nord grid. Various conductors were detected by this survey.
In the fall of 2000, SOQUEM conducted a 1,050-metre, eight-hole drilling program in order to test the best conductors detected in 1999. Numerous sections of mineralized cherts were intersected. Several lenses of pyrrhotite-rich massive sulfides were identified. The Company contributed 50% of the total $201,173 program cost for 2000.
No significant work was carried out on the QUÉNONISCA PROPERTY since 2001. In 2008, the mining claims have been renewed but no exploration work was made on this property.
Item 2: NOTE Detailed uranium exploration analytical procedures
Commitment to Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Ensuring proper quality measurements in all aspects of the exploration phase is a priority for Strateco Resources Inc. (the “Company”). The Company continuously reviews data quality and routinely reviews and enhances its methods of monitoring quality. The Company is committed to proper data gathering and management. External reviews of quality assurance and quality control methods by outside experts such as Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (“Scott Wilson RPA”) have enabled the Company to continuously enhance its procedures. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (“QA/QC”) are notably critical in two aspects of the mineral resource assessment phase: geochemical sampling (assays) and radiometric readings (probing). This Note 1 to the annual report is intended to comprehensively review methods applied to both aspects.
Geochemical sampling
The sampling program at Matoush Project, including all aspects of Quality Assurance and Quality Control, is supervised by the Company’s Chief Geologist, Jonathan Lafontaine, P.Geo., who is a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101.
Sample preparation
Drill core is accurately measured, descriptively logged, and samples picked based on lithology, alteration, and radiometric data carefully measured with a hand-held spectrometer (GR-135 from SAIC). The Company samples all fault zone intersections.
Individual sample lengths vary between 0.5 m to 1.0 m but are subject to variations if the geologist deems this absolutely necessary to ensure proper and comprehensive sampling. Barren samples typically 1.0 m in length are taken to close off the intersections. Core length intersections do not represent true width and are corrected when mineral resources are assessed. It is not the Company’s policy to estimate true widths until three-dimensional continuity of the intercepts is definitively established.
Sampling and Shipment
Three-part sample tags are used to track the samples. The first tag is stapled in the core box with a numerically corresponding aluminum “dymo” tag. The second tag is inserted into a clear plastic bag identified with the identical number inscribed on the bag. The third is archived in the field office located on the Matoush Property. Core is split using a hand or hydraulic splitter according to sample intervals marked on the core with one half preserved in the box and the other inserted into the sealed plastic bag. The sample bags are then placed in large plastic or metal pails of 5 gallons and sealed for shipping. Pails of samples are shipped by helicopter or float plane to the Temiscamie float plane base, trucked to Chibougamau where they are sent by courier to the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) in Saskatoon, SK.
Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) Analytical Procedure
The Geo-analytical Laboratories at SRC are a high quality analytical service facility with a stringent Quality Assurance (QA) program dedicated to actively seeking to evaluate and continually improve the internal quality management system. The laboratory is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada as an ISO/IEC 17025 laboratory for Mineral Analysis Testing and is licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for possession, transfer, import, export, use and storage of designated nuclear substances by CNSC Licence Number 01784-1-09.3.
On arrival at SRC, samples are sorted into lots according to radioactivity level and samples are prepared in order from least to most radioactive. SRC inserts, at the minimum, a blank sample, a duplicate from the batch and a Quality Control (QC) standard of its own with each sample batch.
Sample processing includes the following steps:
1.
Samples are dried and jaw crushed to 60% passing -2 mm.
2.
A 100 g to 200 g subsample is split using a riffler.
3.
A ring and puck grinding mill pulverizes the subsample to 90% passing 106 microns. The mills are cleaned between samples using steel wool and compressed air.
4.
Uranium content is measured by inductively coupled plasma ICP 4-3 (near total tri-acid digestion using fluoric, nitric and perchloric acids followed by a dilute nitric acid bath), ICP 4-3R (partial aqua-regia digestion); fluorimetry on partial digestion is also used if total digestion of U3 O8 is less than 100 PPM.
5.
Samples done by ICP 4-3 also have the full package of trace elements run. Samples with greater than 1,000 ppm U3 O8 are also subjected to an aqua regia digestion before determination of U3 O8 wt% also by ICP and samples are also fire assayed for precious metals (Au, Pt, Pd).
QA/QC methods
SRC QA Protocols
Upon receipt, batches of data are checked in order to determine that the batches of data comply with SRC own analytical protocols; the repeats and standards inserted by the SRC into the batches of samples are also verified.
Quarter-split drill core duplicates
Drill core duplicates assess: the variability introduced by selecting one half of the drill core versus the other, the sample numbering mistakes, and the nugget effect. Samples to be duplicated are randomly selected by the sampling technician with rough guidelines given by the geologist. A quarter-split duplicate is separately inserted every 14 samples by the Company’s sample technician. Once the sample to be duplicated is selected, the sample bag is re-opened; split core is pulled out and quartered into separate bags. Duplicates are inserted randomly into the sample number sequence. A thorough program is underway to clearly determine natural heterogeneity but pairs are considered acceptably identical if they are within 10%. The Company is currently standardizing sample batches to ensure that approximately 5% of all samples in a batch correspond to quarter split duplicates.
Blanks
The regular submission of blank material is used to assess contamination during sample preparation and to identify sample numbering mistakes. Blanks are selected by the sampling technician under the guidance of the geologist. Blanks correspond to clean, non-radioactive, 1 m-long, fine-grained silicified sandstone samples. A blank is separately inserted every 14 samples by the Company’s sample technician. SRC’s system of sorting samples in ascending order of radioactivity helps eliminate significant contamination from preceding samples but also nullifies the use of blanks as contaminant assessment mechanisms. Nonetheless, submission of blanks inserted into the sampling sequence is used to asses sample numbering mistakes. The Company is currently reviewing the threshold for allowable trace uranium to be detected but blanks are considered acceptable if they contain less than 50 PPM. The Company is currently standardizing sample batches to ensure that approximately 3% of all samples in a batch are blanks.
Certified Reference Materials (CRM)
Results from the regular submission of certified reference materials (CRM) are used to identify problems with specific sample batches and long-term biases associated with the regular assay lab (SRC). It is important that the uranium grade of the CRM be representative of the grade range of the resource assays. CRM are sampled with a small baggie and placed in a standard sample bag which is identified and inserted into the sample number sequence. The Company considers that failure occurs when assays from two consecutive CRM are greater than +/- two standard deviations or if the assays from a single CRM are greater than +/- three standard deviations from the expected value. The Company is currently standardizing sample batches to ensure approximately 2% of all samples in a batch are CRM and at least one CRM is inserted into the sample batch.
Future QA/QC methods
The Company is committed to continuously improving QA/QC procedures. As such, the Company is currently reviewing potential analytical procedures to implement assessment of laboratory bias by sending out pulps to a second independent laboratory and re-analysis of coarse pulp duplicates. Although intermittent studies of this type have been completed to satisfaction, a routine has yet to be established.
Radiometric Assays (probing)
All completed drill holes are probed from collar to the end of hole by a geo-technician of the Company after allowing adequate time for washing to remove smear and ensuring proper radon diffusion to ambient background levels. The Company currently uses a Mount Sopris 2GHF triple gamma downhole probing tool which uses a combination of two Geiger-Müller detectors and a sodium iodide detector incorporated into one tool allowing accurate measurements of a variety of uranium mineralization types (from background levels to high grades). Data is collected every 5 cm going up hole.
These data are compared with geochemical grades once sample results are returned from the SRC. Natural variations on the order of 5% - 10% differences in grade x thickness (GT) do occur, though variations are typically less than 5%. Cable stretch and slip are of particular concern and can be as high as approximately 1% (meaning one centimetre of slip and stretch going up hole per metre of coiled cable). Although this value is negligible for drill holes of less than 100 m, it can be significant for the Matoush Project where drill holes usually exceed 300 m and can go as deep as 800 m or more. Stretch and slip of the cable during uphole readings are assumed to be due to cable twisting-untwisting or slip of the pulley that measures cable length. Usually, downhole gamma readings appear higher up in the log than radioactive peaks as measured on drill core. To compensate for this effect, depths are multiplied by 1.01.
Grade X Thickness (GT) estimates
All calculations for the grade x thickness (GT) estimates are based on instrument readings inside a water-filled drill rod string. Raw counts per second (CPS) data are compensated for the dampening effects of steel rods and water. For the 2GHF triple gamma tool, once a simple correction is applied to compensate for the spatial distribution of the detectors in the instrument, the values are smoothed by a moving average covering 70 cm centred on the depth of the instrument measurement to remove spurious short narrow peaks which are not considered representative. The results are triaged based on the ideal range of detection for both types of detectors. The sodium iodide detector readings are retained if they are below 6,000 CPS (i.e., low grades), and the sum of the Geiger-Müller detectors above this cut-off.
An in-house Excel macro uses a high order polynomial (3rd order for sodium iodide detectors, 2nd order for Geiger-Müller detectors) to assign grade to CPS value on a sample per sample basis. This polynomial is determined through controlled experiments using an on-site calibration drill hole from which known assay results are taken. Thus, a known grade over a known thickness is assigned a CPS value for both detectors for a variety of grades typically encountered on the property. The calibrated polynomial curve is acceptable up to the maximum grade encountered on the calibration curve. When this maximum CPS is
exceeded in a drill hole, the calibrated polynomial is no longer applicable over this value and a procedure is in place to re-compute a more accurate polynomial once accepted assay data have been recovered. Finally, the macro will attempt to estimate U3O8 content (eU3O8) over a minimal length that the Company has determined to be geo-physically reliable as per suggested by Mount Sopris information (70 cm). GT estimates are then un-convoluted to length and grade.
QA/QC methods
Once data are imported into the database, the down-hole probing data are visually compared with logged radiometric readings on drill core. Discrepancies in results are immediately investigated and corrected. Although the data sources and reporting methods are significantly different, it is visually checked to ascertain the concordance of peak spacing and general width of mineralized zones. Radiometric data on drill core is gathered by removing each piece of drill core from the ambient background, noting the most pertinent reproducible result, and carefully returning it to its correct place in the core box.
Prior to and after each probed drill hole, the geophysical instrument is tested with a calibration sleeve composed of several Am241 point sources distributed evenly within a steel sleeve slid onto the NaI detector. The Company considers the calibration test acceptable if 95% of measurements fall within 2 standard deviations of the average value.
Furthermore, a water-filled and cased calibration drill hole is probed once per 3-weeks to ensure minimal but measured instrument drift (if any).
Finally, a highly-regarded outside independent specialist in the field of nuclear log analysis, Dr. Robert D. Wilson, reviewed and audited the probing procedures and methods used by the Company. Dr. Wilson concluded that the procedural methods are valid, and protocols are adequate for the remote environment in which the instruments are used.
All reported samples are split with hydraulic splitter by dedicated personnel. Samples are individually bagged and tagged and shipped as per transportation protocols. Blanks, duplicates, and standards are randomly inserted in the sample shipment within the sample number sequence.
Analytical results are received and imported into our data base. Laboratory replicates and laboratory standards are checked. Internal duplicates, blanks and standards are checked. Analytical drift from expect results triggers re-analysis.
Results are also compared with estimated GT values from in-situ downhole probing, and with CPS values logged during initial core logging procedures.
Reference to eU3O8 means the following:
The "e" in eU3O8 represents the estimated or equivalent value of U3O8 as determined by downhole geophysical probing. The "e" indicates that the value is not obtained by drill core assays, but rather by converting gamma radiation measured in situ in the drill hole into U3O8 values by assuming that all gamma radiation can be directly attributed to the quantity of uranium present in the rock. The Company can clearly show that all our mineralized intersections typically have a negligible quantity of radioactivity related to thorium or potassium that would skew this analysis. Furthermore, after isotopic analysis, the Company can safely say that, like most other deposits older than 0.35 million years, the uranium is in equilibrium (i.e. daughter elements are produced and disintegrated at a steady sate, correlated to the quantity of uranium).
This method of distinguishing analytical assay values from geophysical measurements is common in the industry. Although the Company may indicate that reported U3O8 values are estimated from gamma probe readings, it is best to use eU3O8 for clarity, if applicable, as per the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) guidelines cited here: Equivalent Assay: ”Determination of uranium content by radiometric methods. The validity of Equivalent Assays must be demonstrated with chemical assay determination. Where employed, equivalent uranium determination should be reported and appropriately illustrated in the database (e.g. eU3O8)”. Excerpt: http://www.cim.org/committees/estimation2003.pdf at page 50 of 55.
Explanation for U3O8 and eU3O8 comparison:
Assays are considered by the Company to be the “reliable” value. However, down-hole readings are used in lieu of assay data if these data are not available due to missing core or lengthy turn around time by analytical procedures. Comparing the down-hole gamma log data against the assay results is best made on a GT basis for several reasons. First and most obviously, sampled media is different.
Assays represent a measured quantity of uranium, whereas uranium values obtained from the in situ probing represent the radioactive signature of a football-shaped volume incorporating fluids, rod casing and wall rock. Furthermore, the natural heterogeneity of the mineralization may also lead to variation in the estimated grades. It is also important to note that the probe is not centered in the drill rod string but is gravity-held in the trough (bottom) of the rod string as it is descended and raised and thus
does not evenly read the mineralization in the wall rock. Variation of sample length is yet another reason for comparing GT values. Finally, because the end product of the down-hole probing estimate is the GT value (which is later un-convoluted to length and grade), it is simply more advisable to compare the “source” of the data, the GT, rather than the actual grade and lengths.
