Fund VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture
On January 10, 1997, the Fund VIII-Fund IX Joint Venture acquired a two-story office building containing approximately 65,006 rentable square feet on a 4.4-acre tract of land located at 15253 Bake Parkway, in the Irvine Spectrum planned business community in metropolitan Orange
County, California (the "Quest Building"), formerly the Bake Parkway Building. The total consideration paid for the building was $7,193,000 excluding acquisition expenses.
The funds used by the Fund VIII-Fund IX Joint Venture to acquire the Quest Building were derived entirely from capital contributions made to the Fund VIII-Fund IX Joint Venture by Wells Fund IX and Wells Fund VIII. Wells Fund IX and Wells Fund VIII made capital contributions of approximately $3,608,109 and $3,620,316, respectively, to fund the purchase of the building, for total capital contributions to the Fund VIII-Fund IX Joint Venture with respect to the Quest Building of approximately $7,228,425.
On June 15, 2000, the Fund VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture was formed between Wells OP and Fund VIII and Fund IX Associates, a Georgia joint venture partnership between Wells Real Estate Fund VIII, L.P. and Wells Real Estate Fund IX, L.P. (the "Fund VIII-IX Joint Venture"). On July 1, 2000, the Fund VIII-IX Joint Venture contributed its interest in the Bake Parkway Property to the Fund VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture.
A 42-month lease for the entire Bake Parkway Building has been signed by Quest Software, Inc. Occupancy occurred on August 1, 2000. Quest is a publicly traded corporation that provides software database management and disaster recovery services for its clients.
Construction of tenant improvements required under the Quest lease cost approximately $1,231,000 and was funded by Wells OP. As of December 31, 2000, Wells OP held a 15.7% equity interest in the Fund VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture.
On February 18, 1999, Wells Op entered into a Rental Income Guaranty Agreement with Fund VIII and Fund IX Associates, whereby Wells OP guaranteed the VIII-IX Joint Venture that it would receive rental income on the Bake Parkway Building previously leased to Matsushita Avionics at least equal to the rental and building expenses that the VIII-IX Joint Venture would have received over the remaining term of its original lease with Matsushita Avionics. Under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement, Wells OP also guaranteed that, if a joint venture such as the VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture was ever formed by the parties for the ownership and operation of the Bake Parkway Building, Wells OP would guarantee to the VIII-IX Joint Venture that it would receive monthly cash flow distributions from such joint venture at least equal to the rent and building expenses guaranteed under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement. Wells OP had paid approximately $595,000 in rental income guaranty payments to the VIII-IX Joint Venture through December 31, 2000, but has since ceased making such payments since the Bake Parkway Building is now fully leased to Quest. Our maximum liability exposure to the VIII-IX Joint Venture for rental income and building expenses potentially payable under this Rental Income Guaranty Agreement of approximately $3,000,000 was taken into account in the economic analysis performed in making the determination to go forward with the development of the Matsushita Building. Although the lease of the Bake Parkway Building by Quest has, at least temporarily, relieved Wells OP of its obligations under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement, we cannot, at this time, determine the amount Wells OP continues to guaranty payment under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement and, consequently, continues to bear some risk, even though their risk has been substantially minimized by the lease with Quest. Any payment made to the VIII-IX Joint Venture under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement will be made from investor proceeds of the Company.
The average effective rental per square foot at the Quest Building is $13.72 for 2000, $10.11 for 1999, and $10.32 for 1998. The occupancy rate at year end was 100% in 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
