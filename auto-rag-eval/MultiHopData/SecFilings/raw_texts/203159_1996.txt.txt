Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General ------- This discussion contains some forward-looking statements. A forward- looking statement may contain words such as "will continue to be," "will be," "continue to," "expect to," "anticipates that," "to be," or "can impact." Management cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward- looking statements.
The Company engages in financing real estate collateralized contracts, acquiring real estate that is either held for sale or developed and leased or sold and operating Birdies Golf Center as its primary activities. During the past two years, the Company has been emphasizing the development and lease of its commercial office building projects as demand for the available space in these projects has increased. Virtually all of the Company's development of these commercial office building projects has involved extensive remodeling efforts in connection with preparation of previously unoccupied space for a new tenant and structural changes as required by current building codes. As a result of the Company's emphasis, operating lease income has become an increasingly larger portion of total Company income.
The Company invests in real estate collateralized contracts and real property primarily within the state of Washington, with a concentration in Spokane County. The Company has concentrated its efforts primarily on the development and sale of existing real estate projects to maximize the return from those investments. The Company has curtailed its contract acquisitions and now primarily originates real estate contracts to facilitate the sale of its property held for sale or development.
Birdies Golf Center opened to the pubic in fiscal 1996. The Company has focused on a marketing campaign to increase public awareness and attraction to the facility. In addition to its many unique amenities, Birdies has on staff a golf pro and a general manager. In its second year of operations, Birdies is expected to contribute an increasing portion of the Company's income.
The Company finances its investments in real estate and contracts and operates Birdies Golf Center primarily through the sale of fixed rate debentures with terms ranging from one to ten years, real estate notes or mortgages, and a collateralized line-of-credit arrangement with a local bank. The Company intends to continue using these funding sources in the future.
Results of Operations --------------------- For the years ended July 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company's net income was approximately $39,000, $159,000 and $72,000, respectively. Due to dividends and the accretion of the discount on the issuance of preferred stock, the loss applicable to common shareholders was approximately $75,000 in fiscal 1996.
Rental real estate activities have increased as more available space in existing projects has been let and rental rates have been increased. Total rental income has increased from approximately $2,654,000 in fiscal 1994 to $2,715,000 in fiscal 1996. The Company anticipates this trend will continue as additional space is leased and rental rates increase. However, reduced rental income could result from sales of some rental properties.
The total interest income and amortization of discounts on acquired real estate contracts has continued to decline from approximately $1,610,000 and $1,458,000 in fiscal 1994 and 1995, respectively, to approximately $1,265,000 in fiscal 1996. This decline corresponds directly with the decline in the Company's investment in real estate contracts. The Company has curtailed its real estate contract acquisition activities to concentrate its efforts in renovating and leasing commercial office buildings and developing real estate. Collections on real estate contracts have significantly exceeded new acquisitions in each of the last three fiscal years. These funds were used to remodel and develop existing real estate projects and repay outstanding obligations.
Gains on the sale of real estate were approximately $486,000, $585,000 and $186,000 in fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company anticipates that it will continue to recognize gains both on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure and real estate acquired for resale.
Sales of services and tangible products at Birdies were approximately $294,000 in fiscal 1996, which is in line with the Company's expectations for its first year of operations. Overall, the golf center recorded a loss from operations of approximately $143,000, primarily reflecting the initial start-up and staffing costs. The Company anticipates that the margins from its golf center will improve through increased sales in its second year of operations and the non- recurrence of start-up costs.
The expenses associated with rental operations have increased to approximately $2.5 million in fiscal 1996 from approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 1995 and $2.2 million in fiscal 1994. As new tenants are added to the major office building projects, the Company anticipates increased depreciation and interest expense and othercosts associated with the major remodeling projects. However, the resultant increase in rental income is anticipated to more than offset the expected increases in related costs. The rental activities of the Company are expected to continue to contribute significantly to its profitability.
Interest expense, exclusive of interest on rental properties, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $1,216,000, $1,263,000 and $1,363,000 in fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The decline in interest costs over the three-year period has been primarily as a result of a decrease in outstanding borrowings.
Salaries and commissions and general and administrative costs have increased modestly in absolute dollar amounts for each of the last three fiscal years. The commencement of the Birdies operation in early fiscal 1996 contributed to an increase in the number of employees and related salaries and other administrative costs.
The Company's effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before federal income tax was 31% in fiscal 1996; however, its current income tax provision increased significantly due to the reversal of deferred installments gains for tax purposes. Effective August 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was a charge to operations of $61,894 in fiscal 1994.
Liquidity and Capital Resources ------------------------------- At July 31, 1996, the Company had total stockholders' equity of approximately $9,397,000 and a total liabilities to equity ratio of 2.45 to 1, which decreased slightly from 2.64 to 1 a year before. In fiscal 1996, the Company's primary sources of funds were approximately $259,000 from the sale of real estate, $4.2 million in real estate contract collections, $863,000 from the sale of debentures and $1.3 million from the issuance of mortgage and notes payable. The primary uses of funds were approximately $2.5 million used for the acquisition and improvements of real estate projects, $2.2 million in net repayments on the line of credit borrowings and approximately $1.1 million in repayment of outstanding long-term debt. As a holder of monetary assets and liabilities, the Company's performance may be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. These changes are somewhat mitigated or delayed to the extent that much of the Company's investment in real estate contracts, and established real estate leases have fixed returns, as do the Company's debentures. Additionally, the Company will be affected by changes in the real estate market in Washington.
The Company anticipates that sales of debentures and the availability of funds under its $8,000,000 line-of-credit arrangement, of which only approximately $4,448,000 was outstanding at July 31, 1996, will be sufficient to fund its short- and intermediate-term needs to retire maturing debentures and mortgage obligations and continue development of its real estate projects as demand warrants.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards ---------------------------------------------- The Company is required to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" on August 1, 1996. SFAS No. 121 requires that an impairment loss be recognized when the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to result from the use of an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset if the asset is expected to be held and used. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

PACIFIC SECURITY COMPANIES AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Pacific Security Companies and subsidiaries (the Company) is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington. The Company is engaged in the business of owning, selling and leasing real properties and in contract and loan financing, collater- alized by real estate. Most of the Company's real estate activities are concentrated within the state of Washington. The Company completed construction and commenced operations of a golf center during the year ended July 31, 1996. The golf center, located in Spokane, Washington, serves as a practice and teaching center and sells golf clubs and related golf supplies.
A summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company is presented below:
Consolidation ------------- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Aqua View Apartments, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Henry George & Sons Co., Inc. (and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper George Company) (Cooper George) was dissolved during the year ended July 31, 1996. Upon dissolution, all assets of Cooper George were transferred to the Company for the redemption of the outstanding common stock. Cooper George was included in the accounts of the Company during the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994.
The Company sold the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary, Park Manor, Inc., in August 1993. The operating results of Park Manor, Inc., were included in the accounts of the Company during the year ended July 31, 1994.
Cash and Cash Equivalents ------------------------- The Company deposits all cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. The Company considers highly liquid debt instruments, if any, purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Contracts, Mortgages and Finance Notes Receivable ------------------------------------------------- Contracts, mortgages and finance notes receivable are stated at unpaid principal balance, plus accrued interest, less acquisition discounts and an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts, as necessary. Management evaluates receivables which may not be fully collectible to determine if a provision for loss is necessary based on the present value of expected future cash flows from the receivables in the ordinary course of business or from amounts recoverable through foreclosures and the subsequent resale of the collateral.
Interest continues to be accrued on non-performing receivables until such amount is not expected to be recovered.
In May 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" was issued. SFAS No. 114 requires that certain impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. The Company adopted this new standard August 1, 1995, which did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Discounts on Contracts ---------------------- The Company amortizes discounts on purchased contracts using the level-yield method over the expected term of the contracts.
Investment in Rental Properties ------------------------------- Rental properties, including land, buildings and improvements and furniture and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as summarized below: Years ----- Buildings and improvements 15-40 Furniture and equipment 5-10
Upon sale or retirement of depreciable properties, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resultant gain or loss is reflected inoperations.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Investment in Golf Center ------------------------- The golf center, including land, building and improvements and furniture and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as summarized below:
Years ----- Buildings and improvements 15-40 Furniture and equipment 3-10
Interest Capitalization ----------------------- All costs associated with self-constructed assets (including interest and real estate taxes) incurred during the construction period are capitalized. Interest costs of approximately $205,000, $204,000, and $152,000 were capitalized in fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Property Held for Sale or Development ------------------------------------- The Company acquires real estate through direct acquisition and foreclosures and records these assets at the lower of fair value less estimated costs to sell or cost. Losses on properties held for sale or development are recognized if the anticipated cash flows from disposition, less estimated selling costs, are estimated to be less than the carrying value of the related asset.
In March 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long- Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," was issued. SFAS No. 121 requires certain long-lived assets, such as the Company's real estate assets, to be reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review, if expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset or the fair value, less selling costs, from the disposition of the asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is to be recognized. The Company is required to adopt this new standard by August 1, 1996. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 121 will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Marketable Securities --------------------- The Company's investments, consisting of debt and equity securities, are considered to be "available for sale" and, therefore, are carried at market value. Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized on a specific identification basis in the consolidated statement of operations in the period the securities are sold. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of related income taxes, until realized.
Restricted Investments ---------------------- Restricted investments in U.S. Treasury bonds are carried at amortized cost. Premiums or discounts at acquisition are amortized using the interest method over the term of the investment.
Vehicles and Equipment ---------------------- Vehicles and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 5 and 5 to 10 years, respectively. Accumulated depreciation associated with vehicles and equipment was $207,505 and $197,217 at July 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resultant gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Golf Center Inventories ----------------------- Golf center inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.
Sales of Real Estate -------------------- Receipts on sales of real estate investments are accounted for as customer deposits until the principal payments received on the sales contracts exceed the minimum guidelines for gain recognition as established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate" (see Note 4). Losses arising from sales of real estate are recognized immediately upon sale.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Income Taxes ------------ The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109), effective August 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 in fiscal 1994 was a charge to operations of $61,894. SFAS No. 109 requires a company to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company's financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Income or Loss Per Share ------------------------ Income or loss per common share is based on net income or loss after deducting preferred stock dividends and the accretion of the discount on preferred stock divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year.
Credit Risk ----------- Financial instruments which expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, contracts, mortgages and finance notes receivable.
As of July 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company has various cash and investment accounts totaling approximately $446,000 and $564,000, respectively, with one financial institution. These accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000.
The Company's contracts, mortgages and finance notes receivable are primarily from borrowers in the state of Washington and are collateralized principally by real estate located in Washington. Additionally, the outstanding balance of five individual loans totaled approximately $6,740,000 and $8,130,000 at July 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Estimates --------- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications ----------------- Certain amounts in the 1995 and 1994 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on retained earnings or net income as previously reported.
2. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS:
At July 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company holds cash and cash equivalents and investments which are restricted for the following purposes:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
2. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS, CONTINUED: The U.S. Treasury notes held in the replacement and residual receipt reserves at July 31, 1996 bear interest at 6% and mature October 15, 1999.
3. CONTRACTS, MORTGAGES AND FINANCE NOTES RECEIVABLE: At July 31, 1996 and 1995, the aging of amounts due on contracts, mortgages and finance notes receivable was as follows:
1996 1995 ----------- ----------- Current $10,474,252 $13,578,288 31 to 60 days 46,448 133,575 60 to 90 days 85,767 21,345 Over 90 days 102,771 108,998 ----------- ----------- 10,709,238 13,842,206 Less unearned acquisition discounts (216,294) (384,310) ----------- ----------- $10,492,944 $13,457,896 =========== ===========
Substantially all of these receivables are collateralized by land, commercial buildings and single and multi-family residences. Interest rates on most loans are fixed and range from 5.25% to 14.25% at July 31, 1996 and 1995. Approximately $2,626,000 and $2,484,000 of loans outstanding at July 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, have variable interest rates.
Management of the Company provides an allowance for losses based upon estimates of the cash flows to be collected on the receivable or the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of selling costs. At July 31, 1996 and 1995, the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of selling costs, is estimated to be greater than the carrying value of the related contracts and notes, and thus, no allowance for loss has been provided. These estimates can be affected by changes in the economic environment in the state of Washington and the resultant effect on real estate values. As a result of changing economic conditions, it is reasonably possible that the amount of the allowance for loan losses could change in the near term.

The Company leases office space in certain of the above buildings under operating leases. Most of the lease agreements contain renewal options and escalation provisions associated with inflation over the term of the lease. The following is a schedule by years of minimum future rentals on noncancellable operating leases as of July 31, 1996:
Year Ending July 31, ----------- 1997 $1,347,865 1998 1,127,188 1999 911,404 2000 530,203 2001 407,115 Thereafter 412,212 ---------- Total minimum future rentals $4,735,987 ==========
These properties are primarily located in the greater Spokane, Washington geographical area. Losses on investments in rental properties are recognized if the anticipated cash flows from operations or the sale of the rental property, net of selling costs, are estimated to be less than the carrying value of the related asset. These estimates can be affected by changes in the economic environment of the Spokane, Washington area and the resultant effect on the real estate rental and property values. As a result of changing economic conditions, it is reasonably possible that these estimates could change in the near term.

The weighted average interest rate for outstanding debentures at July 31, 1996 and 1995 was 8.01% and 7.99%, respectively. The Securities Act of Washington contains specific statutory and regulatory requirements concerning companies selling debentures in the state of Washington. These regulations require maintenance of minimum net worth and liquidity levels, define debenture terms and maturity limitations, describe financial reporting requirements and prohibit certain activities by controlling persons of the issuer of debentures. Failure to comply with these requirements may jeopardize a company's ability to issue debentures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
12. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK:
The 6% annual dividends on the Class A preferred stock are cumulative. Dividends of $62,400 were declared on the preferred stock during the years ended July 31, 1996 and 1995 and were paid subsequent to each respective year end.
The Company has the right to redeem any shares after three years from the date of issuance. However, all shares are required to be redeemed by the Company ten years after issuance at the par value plus accrued dividends to date of redemption. Due to the mandatory ten-year redemption, the discount on the issuance of the preferred stock is being accreted using the interest method over the redemption period. This accretion is recorded as an increase in the carrying value of the preferred stock and as a charge against retained earnings. The accretion of this discount was $52,000 in each of the years ended July 31, 1996 and 1995.
Each share of Class A Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a stockholders' meeting. The preferred stockholders have liquidation rights equal to the par value plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The liquidation preference of the preferred stock was $1,102,400 at July 31, 1996 and 1995. At July 31, 1996, $800,000 face value of preferred stock has been pledged as collateral for a contract receivable from WCI (see Note 14).
13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments." The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and to develop the estimates of fair value.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Potential income tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses that would be incurred in an actual sale and/or settlement have not been taken into consideration.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED:
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Due to the nature of these financial instruments, carrying value approximates fair value.
DEBENTURE BONDS, CONTRACTS RECEIVABLE AND INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS PAYABLE - Fair values are determined using future cash flows discounted at a rate of interest currently offered for debt or receivables with similar remaining maturities and credit risks. At July 31, 1996, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximated their fair values.
NOTE PAYABLE TO BANK - Fair value approximates the carrying value because the loan bears a variable interest rate.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS - Fair value approximates the carrying value based on quoted market prices.
LIMITATIONS - The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. Because no market exists for many of these financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of what the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

Guthrie and his wife, Constance Guthrie, purchased the Heritage Village apartment complex located in King County, Washington for $2,100,000 from Pacific National Capital Company (which subsequently merged into Pacific Security Companies). The purchase was partially seller-financed by a real estate contract bearing interest at 8% in an original amount of $2,060,000. This contract was assigned to WCI in 1990 (see below). The balance owed on this contract was $539,481 and $654,084 on July 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The taxable gain on this sale was $932,348.

Washington Capital, Inc. (WCI) ------------------------------ In July 1990, certain contracts receivable from Company officers, directors and stockholders were assigned by the Company to WCI, a corporation whose sole stockholder was Wayne E. Guthrie. In December 1991, Mr. Guthrie transferred his ownership interest in WCI to his brother, who is now the sole stockholder in WCI. Generally accepted accounting principles include members of the immediate families of principal owners or management as related parties.
The assignment of the contracts receivable from officers/ directors/stockholders of the Company was made at no gain or loss as WCI executed installment notes payable to the Company for the same principal amounts and interest rates as the contracts assigned to WCI. In 1993, one of the contracts was paid in full. At July 31, 1996 and 1995, the only significant assets and liabilities of WCI were the contract receivable from the officer/stockholder of the Company and the installment contract payable to the Company.

Guthrie and/or WCI pledged $800,000 face value of the Company's Class A Preferred Stock (see Note 12) to guarantee performance and full payment of any account that he or WCI may owe to the Company.
In the event the Company elects to redeem this preferred stock at any time prior to 2002, the proceeds shall be applied to the debt. Also, any dividends included therewith shall be applied to accrued interest paid on the debt.
If the debt is not paid in full prior to July 5, 2002, the Company shall become the owner of the preferred stock, and the liquidation shall be at the Company's sole discretion with the proceeds being applied to the debt along with accrued dividends that may be declared.
The contract receivable by the Company from WCI had balances outstanding of $539,481 and $654,084 at July 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. This contract is repayable in $15,000 monthly installments and bears interest at 8% per annum.
The Securities Act of Washington prohibits a debenture company's officers, directors or controlling persons from directly or indirectly borrowing funds from a debenture company or from indirectly or directly owning real property upon which the debenture company holds a mortgage, deed of trust or property contract. The Securities Division takes the position that the holding of these receivables, whether by the Company or WCI, violates this provision of the Securities Act. The Company has agreed to work with WCI to move these receivables to a party which may legally hold them subject to such restrictions (see Notes 10 and 12).
