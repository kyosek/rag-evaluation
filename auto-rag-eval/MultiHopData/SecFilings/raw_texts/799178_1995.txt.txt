ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Well Statistics
The following table sets forth the number of gross and net productive wells of the Partnerships as of December 31, 1995. The designation of a well as an oil well or gas well is made by the General Partner based on the relative amount of oil and gas reserves for the well. Regardless of a well's oil or gas designation, it may produce oil, gas, or both oil and gas. As used in this Annual Report, "Gross Well" refers to a well in which a working interest is owned, accordingly, the number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. In addition, as used in this Annual Report, "Net Well" refers to the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and
fractions thereof. For example, a 15% leasehold interest in a well represents one Gross Well, but 0.15 Net Well.

- ----------
(1) Wells which have not been designated as oil or gas. (2) Total number of wells for the I-D Partnership represents a significant increase over the number of wells reported in the I-D Partnership's Form 10-K for prior years primarily due to the General Partner obtaining from the third party operator the actual number of wells in the Jo-Mill Unit and the Foster North Unit, both of which are located in the Permian Basin in west Texas.
Drilling Activities
The I-E and I-F Partnerships drilled one gross (.03 and .02 net, respectively) developmental well during the year ended December 31, 1995. This well was completed as a producing gas well on March 12, 1995. The I-B, I-C, and I-D Partnerships did not drill any wells during the year ended December 31, 1995.
Oil and Gas Production, Revenue, and Price History
The following tables set forth certain historical information concerning the oil (including condensates) and natural gas production, net of all royalties, overriding royalties, and other third party interests, of the Partnerships, revenues attributable to such production, and certain price and cost information. As used in the following tables, direct operating expenses include lease operating expenses and production taxes. In addition, gas production is converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf per barrel, representing the estimated relative energy content of gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil
and gas prices. The respective prices of oil and gas are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content.

Proved Reserves and Net Present Value
The following table sets forth each Partnership's estimated proved oil and gas reserves and net present value therefrom as of December 31, 1995. The schedule of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves was prepared by the General Partner in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain reserve information was reviewed by Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Engineers ("Ryder Scott"), an independent petroleum engineering firm. As used throughout this Annual Report, "proved reserves" refers to those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Net present value represents estimated future gross cash flow from the production and sale of proved reserves, net of estimated oil and gas production costs (including production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and operating expenses) and estimated future development costs, discounted at 10% per annum. Net present value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves was calculated on the basis of current costs and prices at December 31, 1995. Such prices were not escalated except in certain circumstances where escalations were fixed and readily determinable in accordance with applicable contract provisions. The prices used in calculating the net present value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and gas production subsequent to December 31, 1995. Furthermore, gas prices at December 31, 1995 were higher than the price used for determining the Partnerships' net present value of proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 1994. There can be no assurance that the prices used in calculating the net present value of the Partnerships' proved reserves at December 31, 1995 will actually be realized for such production.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history, and viability of production under varying economic conditions; consequently, it is reasonably possible that material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the near future. Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that the reserve estimates reported herein represent the most accurate assessment possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.

No estimates of the proved reserves of the Partnerships comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. Additional information relating to the Partnerships' proved reserves is contained in Note 4 to the Partnerships' financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Title to Oil and Gas Properties
Management believes that the Partnerships have satisfactory title to their oil and gas properties. Record title to all of the Partnerships' properties is held by either the Partnerships or Geodyne Nominee Corporation, an affiliate of the General Partner.
Title to the Partnerships' properties is subject to customary royalty, overriding royalty, carried, working, and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, and to other encumbrances. Management believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the Partnerships' interest therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the Partnerships' business.
