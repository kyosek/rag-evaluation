Our Hotel Management Agreements
We are party to hotel management agreements for our 26 hotels owned as of December 31, 2011. Each hotel manager is responsible for (i) the hiring of certain executive level employees, subject to certain veto rights, (ii) training and supervising the managers and employees required to operate the properties and (iii) purchasing supplies, for which we generally will reimburse the manager. The managers (or the franchisors in the case of the Vail Marriott Mountain Resort & Spa, Atlanta Westin North at Perimeter, Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, JW Marriott Denver at Cherry Creek, Courtyard Denver Downtown, and Radisson Lexington Hotel New York) provide centralized reservation systems, national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services. Each manager also prepares and implements annual operations budgets subject to our review and approval. Each of our management agreements limits our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee (i) is not a competitor of the manager, (ii) assumes the related management agreements and (iii) meets specified other conditions.
Term
The following table sets forth the agreement date, initial term and number of renewal terms under the respective hotel management agreements for each of our hotels. Generally, the term of the hotel management agreements renew automatically for a negotiated number of consecutive periods upon the expiration of the initial term unless the property manager gives notice to us
of its election not to renew the hotel management agreement.
________________
(1)
The hotel is under contract to be sold and is classified as "held for sale" and reported in discontinued operations. The sale is expected to close during the first quarter of 2012.
Amounts Payable under our Hotel Management Agreements
Under our current hotel management agreements, the hotel manager receives a base management fee and, if certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management fee. The base management fee is generally payable as a percentage of gross hotel revenues for each fiscal year. The incentive management fee is generally based on hotel operating profits, but the fee only applies to that portion of hotel operating profits above a negotiated return on our invested capital, which we refer to as the owner's priority. We refer to this excess of operating profits over the owner's priority as “available cash flow.”
The following table sets forth the base management fee, incentive management fee and FF&E reserve contribution, generally due and payable each fiscal year, for each of our properties:
____________
(1
)
As a percentage of gross revenues.
(2

Based on a percentage of hotel operating profits above a negotiated return on our invested capital as more fully described in the following footnotes.
(3

Calculated as a percentage of operating profits after an owner's priority of $3.7 million in 2011, $4.2 million in 2012, $4.7 million in 2013 and $5.0 million in 2014. In 2015 and thereafter, the owner's priority adjusts annually based upon CPI. The incentive management fee cannot exceed 1.5% of total revenue.

Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) the payment of certain loan procurement costs, (ii) 10.75% of certain capital expenditures, (iii) an agreed-upon return on certain expenditures and (iv) the value of certain amounts paid into a reserve account established for the replacement, renewal and addition of certain hotel goods. The owner's priority expires in 2027.
(9
)
The contribution is reduced to 1% until operating profits exceed an owner's priority of $3.8 million.
(10
)
Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) actual debt service and (ii) 15% of cumulative and compounding return on equity, which resets with each sale.
(11
)
Calculated as 20% of net operating income before base management fees. There is no owner's priority.
(12
)
The base management fee is reduced by the amount in which operating profits do not meet the performance guarantee. The performance guarantee was $8.2 million in 2011 and base management fees were reduced to zero.
(13
)
The owner's priority is calculated as 103% of the prior year cash flow.
(14
)
The base management fee will increase to 2.5% of gross revenues if the hotel achieves operating profits in excess of 7% of our invested capital and 3% of gross revenues if the hotel achieves operating profits in excess of 8% of our invested capital.
(15
)
Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of 12% of our invested capital and an additional 5% of operating profits in excess of 15% of our invested capital.
We incurred $22.0 million, $19.1 million and $16.8 million of management fees from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The total management fees from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of $5.2 million of incentive management fees and $16.8 million of base management fees. The total management fees from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $4.8 million of incentive management fees and $14.3 million of base management fees. The total management fees from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted of $4.0 million of incentive management fees and $12.8 million of base management fees.
Performance Termination Provisions
Our management agreements provide us with termination rights upon a manager's failure to meet certain financial performance criteria. Our termination rights may, in certain cases, be waived in exchange for consideration from the manager, such as a cure payment. The Conrad Chicago failed the performance test under the management agreement in early 2011 and we negotiated an amendment to the management agreement with Hilton, which permitted them to remain as manager under certain terms and conditions, including a performance guarantee for the remainder of the term of the agreement. The Orlando Airport Marriott failed the performance test under the management agreement at the end of 2011. We are currently evaluating whether we will exercise our termination right. Based on our forecast and the hotel's budget, the Oak Brook Hills Marriott Resort is at risk of failing its performance test at the end of 2012.
Our Franchise Agreements
The following table sets forth the terms of the hotel franchise agreements for our six franchised hotels:
____________
We recorded $5.7 million, $2.6 million and $1.9 million of franchise fees during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The ground lease payment and related property tax liability were negotiated as a single payment in lieu of taxes. The single payments increase at a rate of 5% per year through 2018. Beginning in 2019, there will no longer be a stipulated single payment and the hotel will pay only the real property tax portion of the initial single payment based on the then assessed valuation and applicable tax rate.

The hotel is under contract to be sold and is classified as "held for sale" and reported in discontinued operations. The sale is expected to close during the first quarter of 2012.

We have the right to extend the term of this lease for two consecutive renewal terms of ten years each with rent at then market value.
Subject to certain limitations, an assignment of the ground leases covering the Courtyard Manhattan/Fifth Avenue, a portion of the Marriott Griffin Gate Resort golf course and the Oak Brook Hills Marriott Resort golf course do not require the consent of the ground lessor. With respect to the ground leases covering the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown hotel and extension, Bethesda Marriott Suites, Westin Boston Waterfront and Hilton Minneapolis, any proposed assignment of our leasehold interest as ground lessee under the ground lease requires the consent of the applicable ground lessor. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our ground lessee's interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of the ground lessor, even if such transaction may be in the best interests of our stockholders.
