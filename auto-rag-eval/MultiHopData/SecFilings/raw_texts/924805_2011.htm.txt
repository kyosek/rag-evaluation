Item 2. Properties
Our properties comprise an 850 contiguous square kilometer area in the Mangistau Region of southwestern Kazakhstan.
Exploratory and Developmental Acreage
The following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped mineral acreage by block at March 31, 2011.
Development of Oil and Gas Properties in Kazakhstan
Under the statutory scheme in the Republic of Kazakhstan prospective oil fields are developed in two stages. The first stage is an exploration and appraisal stage during which a private contractor is given a license to explore for oil and gas on a territory for a set term of years. During this stage the primary focus is on the search for a commercial discovery, i.e., a discovery of a sufficient quantity of oil and gas to make it commercially feasible to pursue execution of, or transition to, a commercial production contract with the government. Under the terms of an exploration contract the contract holder has the right to sell all oil and natural gas produced during the term of the exploration contract.
Emir Oil holds a 100% interest in both a license to use subsurface mineral resources and a hydrocarbon exploration contract issued by the ROK in 1999 and 2000, respectively (collectively referred to herein as the “license” or the “exploration contract”). The exploration and development stage of our exploration contract expires in January 2013.
This exploration contract originally granted us the right to engage in exploration and development activities in an area of approximately 200 square kilometers referred to herein as the ADE Block. The ADE Block is comprised of three fields, the Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Emir fields. During our 2006 fiscal year our exploration contract was expanded to include an additional 260 square kilometers of land adjacent to the ADE Block, which we refer to herein as the Southeast Block, which includes the Kariman oil and gas field and the Borly and Yessen structures. In October 2008 the MEMR (as defined herein) granted us an additional 390 square kilometer area, referred to herein as the Northwest Block bringing our total contract area to 850 square kilometers (approximately 210,000 acres). The Northwest Block extends north and west from the ADE Block toward the Caspian Sea. The Southeast Block and the Northwest Block are governed by the terms of our exploration contract.
In order to be assured that adequate exploration activities are undertaken during exploration stage, the MOG establishes an annual mandatory minimum work program to be accomplished in each year of the exploration contract. Under the minimum work program the contractor is required to invest a minimum dollar amount in exploration activities within the contract territory, which may include geophysical studies, construction of field infrastructure or drilling activities. During the exploration stage, the contractor is also required to drill sufficient wells in each field to establish the existence of commercially producible reserves in any field for which it seeks a commercial production license. Failure to complete the minimum work program requirements for any particular field during the term of the exploration contract could preclude the contractor from receiving a longer-term production contract for such field and result in relinquishment of the field back to the ROK, regardless of the success of the contractor in proving commercial reserves during the partial fulfillment of the minimum work program.
The contract we hold follows the above format. The contract sets the minimum dollar amount we must expend during each year of our work program. Our work program year ends on January 9 of each year through January 9, 2013. Therefore our work program year does not coincide with our fiscal year. As a result of these timing differences, the amounts reflected in the table below as “Actually Made” may differ from amounts disclosed in this report in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations or the consolidated financial statements included in this report, which present figures based on our fiscal year rather than our work program year.

* Investment as of March 31, 2011.
Under the rules of the MOG there is a process whereby expenditures above the minimum requirements in one period may be carried over to meet minimum obligations in future periods. As the above chart shows we have significantly exceeded the minimum expenditure requirement in each period of the contract and have more than doubled the total minimum capital expenditure requirement during the exploration stage.
In addition to mandatory minimum capital expenditures in each year, exploration contracts typically require the contract holder to drill a certain number of wells in each structure for which it plans to seek commercial production rights.
Typically, one exploratory well and two appraisal wells are sufficient to support a claim of commercially producible reserves in a particular field, although in some cases, commercial reserves have been demonstrated with fewer wells. The total number of wells the MOG requires during exploration stage is generally determined by the number of fields or structures identified by the seismic studies done on a territory. Three dimensional ("3D") seismic studies completed on the ADE Block and the Southeast Block, have identified six potential fields or structures.
Chapman Petroleum (as defined herein) has identified four potential structures in the Northwest Block territory based principally on interpretation of recently completed 3D seismic studies in the Northwest Block territory.
To date, we have drilled a total of 24 wells as set forth in more detail below:

Remaining Wells to Drill by 2013
(1) Addendum No. 6 to our exploratory contract requires the drilling of three exploratory wells. Based on our experience, however, we assume we will need to drill a minimum of one exploratory well and two appraisal wells in each of the four potential structures identified in the Northwest Block by Chapman Petroleum Engineering to determine whether commercially producible reserves exist in any of the potential structures.
The bottom half of the above chart shows current progress on drilling of exploratory and appraisal wells.
Pursuant to the terms of the extensions of our exploration contract, we are required to drill not less than nine new wells by January 9, 2013. With the identification of four potential structures in the Northwest Block, we anticipate that well drilling requirement will increase significantly if we are to determine the existence of commercially producible reserves in any of the possible structures in the Northwest Block. Due to the difficult financial situation we have faced the past fiscal year, we were unable to drill any new wells. We do not expect our financial situation to improve sufficiently to allow us to complete our exploration obligations prior to January 2013. In addition to these drilling obligations, once a contractor moves to commercial production, it becomes subject to a new work program designed to maximize production. This new work program imposes additional drilling and development obligations. Given our financial situation, we do not anticipate being able to satisfy the drilling requirements of a commercial production work program, which likely would result in the loss of any commercial production contract we would have been awarded. These factors contributed to our decision to sell our interest in Emir Oil.
Drilling Operations
Over the past fiscal year we have concentrated our operational efforts on stabilizing and maintaining production through work with our existing wellstock, including sidetracking operations. We have utilized services of XIBU Drilling services and Frac Jet Drilling and Workover Company for these purposes.
During the fourth fiscal quarter, in January 2011 we commenced sidetracking at the Dolinnoe 6 well location. The kick off point for the sidetrack was at the depth of 3,140-3,142 m. The sidetrack was drilled to 3,932 m. We have experienced high gas readings while drilling and at the bottom of the well (gas was 100%, methane 40%). The well was completed in April 2011.
Subsequent to the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, in April 2011 we commenced the sidetrack for the Dolinnoe 2 well. The window was milled at the depth of 3,411-3,440 m. The sidetrack was successfully completed to a depth of 3,736m in April 2011.
In February 2011 Frac Jet Drilling and Workover Company commenced a sidetrack on the Kariman 11 well. The window was milled at the depth of 3,309-3,314.8m. We experienced a number of technical difficulties while drilling this section which forced us to re-mill a new window at the depth of 3,299.96m. Drilling of this well was completed successfully in April 2011.
We have also made much progress in eventual transition of a portion of our existing assets to commercial production. Transition of the Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Kariman wells to commercial production is one of the conditions to closing the Sale. We have successfully proved reserves related to the above-mentioned three fields with the Geological Committee of the MOG. Subsequently the technical scheme was developed by our design institute and was also successfully approved by the Government. Currently we are awaiting approval on the working program and feasibility study by the MOG which has to be subsequently reviewed and approved by various ministries and agencies in Kazakhstan before commercial production for Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Kariman can be signed. We expect this process to be completed in the third calendar quarter 2011.
Chapman Petroleum, our independent reserve engineers, has confirmed the presence and identification of at least four structures on the territory of the Northwest block. Our further activities related to the Northwest block will depend on the results of the pending Sale. If the Sale does not close for whatever reason we anticipate we will use internally generated cash flow or will seek alternative funding to commence exploration drilling in the Northwest block.
Well Performance and Production
The following table sets forth our gross and net working interests in exploratory and development wells drilled during the three years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, each of the 24 wells identified above was in test production, testing or under or awaiting workover. Each of the above listed wells is Company operated.
According to the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, we are required to test every prospective target on our properties separately; this includes the completion of well surveys on different modes with various choke sizes on each horizon.
In the course of well testing, when the transfer from target to target occurs, the well must be shut in; oil production ceases for the period of mobilization/demobilization of the workover rig, pull out of the hole, run in the hole, perforation, packer installation time, etc. This has the effect of artificially diminishing production rates averaged over a set period of time.
During our fourth fiscal quarter 2011, our average daily crude oil production was 2,381 barrels per day. Following is a brief description of the production rates of each of our 24 wells during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.

(3) Emir wells are on temporary abandonment as the Company is planning for submission of an application for pilot development project for this field.
(4) We have installed centrifugal submersible pumps at these wells. After a brief period of testing and fine tuning, production from this well stabilized. Stabilized production rates are included in the table above.
Proved Reserves Disclosures
Recent Commission Rule-Making Activity. In December 2008, the Commission announced that it had approved revisions to modernize the oil and gas reserve reporting disclosures. The new disclosure requirements include provisions that:
·
Introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations.
·
Report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end prices.
·
Permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. In the past, proved reserves were the only reserves allowed in the disclosures. We have chosen not to make disclosure under these categories.
·
Require companies to provide additional disclosure regarding the aging of proved undeveloped reserves.
·
Permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.
·
Replace the existing “certainty” test for areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a productive well with a “reasonable certainty” test.
·
Require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company’s overall reserve estimation process. Additionally, disclosures regarding internal controls over reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor will be mandatory.
We adopted the rules effective March 31, 2011.
The new rule does not allow for prior-year reserve information to be restated, so all information related to periods prior to 2011 is presented consistent with prior Commission rules for the estimation of proved reserves.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following table sets forth our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to such reserves as of March 31, 2011. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The oil and natural gas reserve data included in, or incorporated by reference in this document, are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate.
(1)
Under our exploration contract we have the right to sell the oil and natural gas we produce while we undertake exploration stage activities within our licensed territory. As discussed in more detail in “Risk Factors” and “Properties” we have the right to engage in exploration stage activities until January 9, 2013. To retain our rights to produce and sell oil and natural gas after that date, we must apply for and be granted commercial production rights by no later than January 2013 or obtain a further extension of our exploration contract. If we are not granted commercial production rights or another extension by that time, we would expect to lose our rights to the licensed territory and would expect to be unable to produce reserves after January 2013.
(2)
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
(3)
Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(4)
Includes natural gas liquids.
(5)
The coefficient for conversion of production and sales of gas from cubic meters to barrels equals: 1 thousand m3 = 5.8857 barrels of oil equivalent.
(6)
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represents the present value of future net cash flow net of all taxes.
As of March 31, 2011 our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax PV10 value of approximately $545.6 million and a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows of approximately $392.4 million.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our reserve estimates as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 include 3.2 million and 2.6 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves, respectively. The change in proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended March 31, 2011 was due to the increase of proved undeveloped reserves of oil in the amount of 81,000 BOE and an increase in proved undeveloped reserves of gas in the amount of 601,000 BOE. We did not incur capital expenditures for conversion of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves as of year ended March 31, 2011.
Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimates.
We engaged Chapman Petroleum Engineering, Ltd. (“Chapman Petroleum”), to estimate our net proved reserves, projected future production and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of March 31, 2011. Chapman Petroleum’s estimates are based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data provided by us. Chapman Petroleum has independently evaluated our reserves for the past several years. In estimating the reserve quantities that are economically recoverable, Chapman Petroleum used oil and natural gas prices in effect as of March 31, 2011 without giving effect to hedging activities. In accordance with requirements of Commission regulations, no price or cost escalation or reduction was considered by Chapman Petroleum. Our reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by our Chief Executive Officer and our President. Our Chief Financial Officer reviews the reserves estimates to assure compliance with Commission reporting requirements. A letter which identifies the professional qualifications of the individual who was responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates as of March 31, 2011 has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

The reserve data set forth herein represents estimates only. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates, and such revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Furthermore, the estimated future net revenue from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including current prices, production levels and costs that may vary from what is actually incurred or realized.
No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the Commission.
In accordance with Commission regulations, the Chapman Petroleum Report used oil and natural gas average prices in effect during the year ended March 31, 2011. The prices used in calculating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and natural gas production subsequent to March 31, 2011. There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will actually be realized for such production or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

The related production costs were expensed only for the units sold, not produced based on a matching principle of accounting. Therefore, oil and gas operating expense per BOE was calculated by dividing oil and gas operating expenses for the year by the volume of oil sold during the year.

Office Facilities
Our principal executive and corporate offices are located in an office building located at 202 Dostyk Avenue, in Almaty, Kazakhstan. We lease this space and believe it is sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
We also maintain an administrative office in Salt Lake City, Utah. The address is 324 South 400 West, Suite 255, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101, USA.
