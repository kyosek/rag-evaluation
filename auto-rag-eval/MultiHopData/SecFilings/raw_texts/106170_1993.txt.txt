Item 2. Properties
The physical properties of the System are owned or leased by subsidiaries of NU. CL&P's principal plants and other properties are located either on land which is owned in fee or on land, as to which CL&P owns perpetual occupancy rights adequate to exclude all parties except possibly state and federal governments, which has been reclaimed and filled pursuant to permits issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The principal properties of PSNH are held by it in fee. In addition, PSNH leases space in an office building under a 30-year lease expiring in 2002. WMECO's principal plants and a major portion of its other properties are owned in fee, although one hydroelectric plant is leased. NAEC owns a 35.98201 percent interest in Seabrook 1, and approximately 719 acres of exclusion area land located around the unit. In addition, CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO have certain substation equipment, data processing equipment, nuclear fuel, nuclear control room simulators, vehicles, and office space that are leased. With few exceptions, the System's companies' lines are located on or under streets or highways, or on properties either owned, leased, or in which the company has appropriate rights, easements, or permits from the owners.
CL&P's properties are subject to the liens of CL&P's first mortgage indenture and, with respect to properties formerly owned by The Hartford Electric Light Company (HELCO), to the lien of HELCO's first mortgage indenture. PSNH's properties are subject to the lien of its first mortgage indenture. In addition, PSNH's outstanding term loan and revolving credit agreement borrowings are secured by a second lien, junior to the lien of the first mortgage indenture, on PSNH property located in New Hampshire. WMECO's properties are subject to the lien of its first mortgage indenture. NAEC's First Mortgage Bond are secured by a lien on the Seabrook 1 interest described above, and all rights of NAEC under the Seabrook Power Contract. In addition, CL&P's and WMECO's interests in Millstone 1 are subject to second liens for the benefit of lenders under agreements related to pollution control revenue bonds. Various ones of these properties are also subject to minor encumbrances which do not substantially impair the usefulness of the properties to the owning company.
The System companies' properties are well maintained and are in good operating condition.
Notes:
1. Until 1991, awards under the short-term programs of the Northeast tilities Executive Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) were made in restricted stock. In 1991, the Northeast Utilities Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) was adopted, which did not require restricted stock awards. Awards under the 1991 and 1992 short-term programs under the EIP were paid in 1992 and 1993, respectively, in the form of unrestricted stock and, in accordance with the requirements of the SEC, are included as "bonus" in the years earned.
2. The five executive officers listed in the table above each received an award of restricted stock in May, 1991 (which vested in January, 1993), under the EICP. The number of shares in each such award is shown below. All restricted stock awards under the EICP vested prior to December 31, 1993.
Name Shares
B. M. Fox 1,807 W. B. Ellis 2,585 J. F. Opeka 1,349 R. E. Busch 1,090 J. P. Cagnetta 847
3. "All Other Compensation" consists of employer matching contributions under the Northeast Utilities Service Company Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan (401(k) Plan), generally available to all eligible employees. In 1993, the employer match for non-union employees was 100 percent of the first three percent of compensation contributed on a before-tax basis.
4. Awards under the short-term program of the EIP have typically been made by NU's Committee on Organization, Compensation and Board Affairs in April each year. Based on preliminary estimates of corporate performance, and assuming that the individual performance levels of Messrs. Opeka, Busch and Cagnetta approximate those of other system officers, it is estimated that the five executive officers listed in the table above would receive the following awards: Mr. Fox - $180,780; Mr. Ellis - $160,693; Mr. Busch - $64,946; Mr. Opeka - $64,946; and Dr. Cagnetta - $43,828.
5. Mr. Fox served as President and Chief Operating Officer of CL&P, NAEC and WMECO and Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officers of PSNH until July 1, 1993, when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of CL&P, NAEC and WMECO and Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PSNH. Mr. Ellis served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of these companies until July 1, 1993, when he became Chairman. Amounts listed in the "Long Term Incentive Program" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 1993 were received by these individuals prior to their change in responsibilities. $267,500 of Mr. Ellis's 1993 salary was paid prior to July 1, 1993, while he was Chief Executive Officer, and $253,750 was paid after July 1, 1993. $217,500 of Mr. Fox's 1993 salary was paid prior to July 1, 1993, and $261,275 was paid after Mr. Fox became Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 1993.
PENSION BENEFITS
The following table shows the estimated annual retirement benefits payable to an executive officer of NU, CL&P, WMECO, PSNH and NAEC upon retirement, assuming that retirement occurs at age 65 and that the officer is at that time not only eligible for a pension benefit under the Northeast Utilities Service Company Retirement Plan (the Retirement Plan) but also eligible for the "make-whole benefit" and the "target benefit" under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for Officers of Northeast Utilities System Companies (the Supplemental Plan). The Supplemental Plan is a non-qualified pension plan providing supplemental retirement income to System officers. The "make-whole benefit" under the Supplemental Plan makes up for benefits lost through application of certain tax code limitations on the benefits that may be provided under the Retirement Plan, and is available to all officers. The "target benefit" further supplements these benefits and is available to officers at the Senior Vice President level and higher who are selected by the NU Board of Trustees to participate in the target benefit and who remain in the employ of NU companies until at least age 60 (unless the NU Board of Trustees sets an earlier age). Each of the executive officers of NU, CL&P, WMECO, PSNH and NAEC named in the summary compensation table above is currently eligible for a target benefit. If an executive officer were not eligible for a target benefit at the time of retirement, a lower level of retirement benefits would be paid.
The benefits presented are based on a straight life annuity beginning at age 65 and do not take into account any reduction for joint and survivorship annuity payments.

Final average compensation for purposes of calculating the "target benefit" is the highest average annual compensation of the participant during any 36 consecutive months compensation was earned. Compensation taken into account under the "target benefit" described above includes salary, bonus, restricted stock awards, and long-term incentive payouts shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, but does not include employer matching contributions under the Northeast Utilities Service Company Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan (401(k)) Plan. In the event that an officer's employment terminates because of disability, the retirement benefits shown above would be offset by the amount of any disability benefits payable to the recipient that are attributable to contributions made by NU and its subsidiaries under long term disability plans and policies.
As of December 31, 1993, the five executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table above had the following years of credited service for retirement compensation purposes: Mr. Fox - 29, Mr. Ellis - 17, Mr. Opeka - 23, Mr. Busch - 20 and Dr. Cagnetta - 21. Assuming that retirement were to occur at age 65 for these officers, retirement would occur with 43, 29, 35, 38 and 25 years of credited service, respectively.
NU has entered into agreements with Messrs. Ellis and Fox to provide for an orderly management succession. The agreement with Mr. Ellis calls for him to work with the NU Board of Trustees and Mr. Fox to effect the orderly transition of his responsibilities to Mr. Fox. In accordance with the agreement, Mr. Ellis stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of NU, CL&P, WMECO, PSNH and NAEC as of July 1, 1993. The agreement anticipates his retirement as of August 1, 1995.
The agreement provides that, upon his retirement, Mr. Ellis will be entitled to receive from NU and its subsidiaries a target benefit under the Supplemental Plan. His target benefit will be based on the greater of his actual final average compensation or an amount determined as if his salary had increased each year since 1991 at a rate equal to the average rate of the increases of all other target benefit participants and as if he had received incentive awards each year based on this modified salary, but with the same performance as the Chief Executive Officer at the time. The agreement also provides specified death and disability benefits for the period before Mr. Ellis's 1995 retirement.
The agreement with Mr. Fox states that if he is terminated as Chief Executive Officer without cause, he will be entitled to specified severance pay and benefits. Those benefits consist primarily of (i) two years' base pay, medical, dental and life insurance benefits, (ii) a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the difference between the target benefit he would be entitled to receive if he had reached the age of 55 on the termination date and the actual target benefit to which he is entitled as of the termination date, and (iii) a target benefit under the Supplemental Plan, notwithstanding that he might not have reached age 60 on the termination date and notwithstanding other forfeiture provisions of that plan. The agreement also provides specified death and disability benefits. The agreement terminates two years after NU gives Mr. Fox a notice of termination, but no earlier than the date he becomes 55.
The agreements do not address the officers' normal compensation and benefits, which are to be determined by NU's Committee on Organization, Compensation and Board Affairs and the NU Board of Trustees in accordance with their customary practices.
