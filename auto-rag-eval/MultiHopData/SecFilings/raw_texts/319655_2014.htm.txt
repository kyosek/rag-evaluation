ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Royalty conveyed to the Trust was carved out of Southland’s (now Burlington’s) working interests and royalty interests in certain properties situated in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico. See “Item 1. Business” for information on the conveyance of the Royalty to the Trust. References below to “gross” wells and acres are to the interests of all persons owning interests therein, while references to “net” are to the interests of Burlington (from which the Royalty was carved) in such wells and acres.
Unless otherwise indicated, the following information in this Item 2 is based upon data and information furnished to the Trustee by Burlington.
Producing Acreage, Wells and Drilling
The Underlying Properties consist of working interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests and other contractual rights in 151,900 gross (119,000 net) producing acres in San Juan, Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties of northwestern New Mexico and 4,000 gross 1,154.8 net) wells, calculated on a well bore basis and not including multiple completions as separate wells. Of those wells, seven gross (five net) are oil wells and the balance are gas wells. Burlington reports that approximately 845 gross (322.52 net) of the wells are multiple completion wells resulting in a total of 4,845 gross (1,477.62 net) completions. The Trust has inquired of Burlington whether the acreage is developed or undeveloped. Burlington has informed the Trust that all of the subject acreage is held by production, and even though it has not been fully developed in every formation, Burlington has classified all of such acreage as developed. Production from conventional gas wells is primarily from the Pictured Cliffs, Mesaverde and Dakota formations. During 1988, Southland began development of coal seam reserves in the Fruitland Coal formation. In 2011 Burlington drilled a well which was completed not only to the Mesaverde and the Dakota formations, but also to the Mancos Shale formation which lies between the two. In 2012 and 2013 Burlington drilled an exploratory horizontal well in the Mancos Shale formation, which was completed on lands burdened by the Royalty. While Burlington will continue to assess its program of horizontal drilling, it expects no new horizontal drilling activity in the San Juan Basin in 2015.
The Royalty conveyed to the Trust is limited to the base of the Dakota formation, which is currently the deepest significant producing formation under acreage affected by the Royalty. Rights to production, if any, from deeper formations are retained by Burlington.
Capital expenses of $6.5 million were included in calculating Royalty Income paid to the Trust in calendar year 2014, and included expenditures for the drilling of five gross (3.2 net) conventional wells. All five of such conventional wells were commenced in the fourth quarter. Two gross (1.13 net) were completed, and three gross (2.1 net) were still in progress as of December 31, 2014. Burlington reports that a sixth conventional well was spudded December 31, 2014 which, by Burlington’s convention, will be accounted for as attributable to its capital budget for 2015. All of the wells commenced in 2014 were development wells. There were no dry exploratory or development wells drilled in 2014.
Approximately $1.8 million of capital expenditures covered 103 projects budgeted for prior years, including continued work on 49 new wells commenced in the years prior to 2014, all operated by Burlington, and 54 maintenance and facilities projects. The approximately $4.7 million balance for 2014 expenditures was attributable to five operated new drill projects, and 41 projects for the maintenance and improvement of production facilities.
The capital expenses reported by Burlington for 2014 included amounts attributable to the capital budgets for prior years because capital expenditures are deducted in calculating Royalty Income in the month they accrue, and projects within a given year’s budget often extend into subsequent years. Further, Burlington’s accounting period for capital expenditures runs through November 30 of each calendar year, such that capital expenditures incurred in December of each year are actually accounted for as part of the following year’s capital expenditures. In addition, with respect to wells not operated by Burlington, Burlington’s share of capital expenditures may not actually be paid by it until the year or years after those expenses were incurred by the operator.
During 2013, in calculating Royalty Income, Burlington deducted approximately $21.5 million of capital expenditures for projects, including the drilling and completion of 19 gross (9.85 net) conventional wells. All of the wells commenced in 2013 were development wells. There was one exploratory well completed in 2013 at a cost of approximately $3.45 million, as described above. There were no conventional wells in progress as of December 31, 2013. There were no dry exploratory or development wells drilled in 2013.
During 2012, in calculating Royalty Income, Burlington deducted approximately $22.2 million of capital expenditures for projects, including the drilling and completion of 28 gross (7.97 net) conventional wells. There were six gross (4.39 net) conventional wells in progress as of December 31, 2012. As discussed above, during 2012, Burlington commenced an exploratory horizontal well in the Mancos Shale formation. All of the other wells were development wells and there were no dry development or exploratory wells drilled in 2012.
Burlington has informed the Trust that its budget for capital expenditures for the Underlying Properties in 2015 is estimated at $14 million. Burlington reports that based on its actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals, the mix of projects and swings in the price of natural gas, the actual capital expenditures for 2015 are subject to change.
Burlington anticipates 91 projects in 2015. However, in light of the challenged price environment for natural gas and natural gas liquids, Burlington anticipates no new drilling or recompletion activity to be commenced during 2015 after the first quarter of that year. Approximately $5.5 million of the 2015 budget is to be spent on six new drills to be operated by Burlington and $1.7 million is allocated to 40 miscellaneous facilities projects. The $6.8 million balance of the aggregate $14 million is attributable to the budgets for prior years, including five new wells commenced prior to 2015 and 40 miscellaneous capital projects such as workovers and operated facility projects.
Burlington plans a temporary suspension of its drilling program in the San Juan Basin after the first quarter of 2015, indicating that it currently plans to have no drilling rigs operating in the Basin during the balance of calendar year 2015. However, Burlington reported that it continually monitors natural gas prices and plans to restart the program at some point in the future, dependent upon such gas prices. Existing wells will continue to be operated.
In February 2002, Burlington informed the Trust that the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (the “OCD”) had approved plans for 80-acre infill drilling of the Dakota formation in the San Juan Basin. In July 2003, the OCD approved 160-acre spacing in the Fruitland Coal formation. Eighty-acre spacing has been permitted in the Mesaverde formation since 1997. The OCD has approved 320-acre spacing units for wells completed to the Mancos Shale within the Basin Mancos Gas Pool. For wells drilled horizontally, multiple units may be combined along the well bore so long as that well bore is perforated in each such unit.
Oil and Gas Production
The Trust recognizes production during the month in which the related net proceeds attributable to the Royalty are paid to the Trust. Royalty Income for a calendar year is based on the actual gas and oil production during the period beginning with November of the preceding calendar year through October of the current calendar year. Production of oil and gas and related average sales prices attributable to the Royalty for the three years ended December 31, 2014, were as follows:
Production volumes and costs attributable to the Underlying Properties for the three years ended December 31, 2014 were as follows:
Pricing Information
Gas produced in the San Juan Basin is sold in both interstate and intrastate commerce. Reference is made to the discussion contained herein under “Regulation” for information as to federal regulation of prices of oil and natural gas. Gas production from the Underlying Properties totaled 30,872,147 Mcf during 2014.
Gas produced from the Underlying Properties is processed at one of the following five plants: Chaco, Val Verde, Milagro, Ignacio, and Kutz, all located in the San Juan Basin. All of such gas other than that processed at Kutz is being sold to Chevron USA, Inc. (“Chevron”) under a contract with Burlington dated April 1, 2011 which provides for the delivery of gas through March 31, 2015 and from year to year thereafter. Neither Burlington nor Chevron exercised their right to terminate the Chevron contract and therefore, its term has been extended through March 31, 2016, and thereafter until terminated by either party upon six months notice to the other.
Gas produced from the Underlying Properties and processed at Kutz was being sold under three separate contracts with EDF Trading North America, LLC (“EDF”), Shell Energy North America (US), LP (“Shell”) and New Mexico Gas Company, Inc. (“NMGC”). The NMGC contract for the sale of certain winter-only supplies of the Kutz gas is for a five-year term expiring March 31, 2017. The contracts effective as of April 1, 2014 with EDF and Shell are set to expire March 31, 2015. Burlington has circulated another round of requests for proposal for the purchase of those volumes through March 31, 2016.
All four of the current contracts provide for (i) the delivery of such gas at various delivery points through their respective termination dates; and (ii) the sale of such gas at prices which fluctuate in accordance with the published indices for gas sold in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico.
Burlington contracts with Williams Four Corners, LLC (“WFC”) and Enterprise Field Services, LLC (“EFS”) for the gathering and processing of virtually all of the gas produced from the Underlying Properties. Four new contracts were entered into with WFC, each of which is effective for a term of 15 years, which commenced April 1, 2010. Burlington has signed a similar agreement with EFS which was effective
November 1, 2011 for a term of 15 years. Burlington has disclosed to the Trust a summary of that agreement which the Trust has reviewed with its consultants, subject to conditions of confidentiality.
Confidentiality agreements with gatherers and purchasers of gas produced from the Underlying Properties prohibit public disclosure of certain terms and conditions of gas sales contracts with those entities, including specific pricing terms and gas receipt points. Such disclosure could compromise the ability to compete effectively in the marketplace for the sale of gas produced from the Underlying Properties.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The following are definitions adopted by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are applicable to terms used within this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
“Developed oil and gas reserves” are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(6).
“Estimated future net revenues” are computed by applying current oil and gas prices (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements and allowed by federal regulation) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(c)(4)(A). “Estimated future net revenues” are sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “estimated future net cash flows.”
“Present value of estimated future net revenues” is computed using the estimated future net revenues (as defined above) and a discount rate of 10%. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(c)(4)(A).
“Proved oil and gas reserves” are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(22).
“Proved reserves” are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(22); 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(2)(iii).
“Proved undeveloped reserves” or “PUDs” are undeveloped oil and gas reserves.
“Reasonable certainty” means (i) if deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered or (ii) if probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(24).
“Reserves” are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known
accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(26).
“Undeveloped oil and gas reserves” are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(31).
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment. The Trust, however, does not have information that would be available to a company with oil and gas operations because detailed information is not generally available to owners of royalty interests. Given this, the Trustee accumulates information and data provided by Burlington regarding the Royalty derived from the Underlying Properties and provides such information to Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”). CG&A extrapolates from such information estimates of the reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties based on its expertise in the oil and gas fields where the Underlying Properties are situated, as well as publicly available information. The Trust maintains internal controls and procedures applicable to reserve estimation which are reviewed annually and updated as required and reviews the reserve reports prepared by CG&A for reasonableness. The Trust’s internal controls and procedures regarding reserve estimates require proved reserves to be determined and disclosed in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance.
The Trust does not maintain an internal petroleum engineering department and instead relies upon CG&A for a qualified, independent report of estimated reserves. The Trust verifies the qualifications and credentials of CG&A to prepare reserve estimates on behalf of the Trust. The independent petroleum engineers’ reports as to the proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were prepared by CG&A. CG&A, whose firm registration number is, was founded in 1961 and is nationally recognized in the evaluation of oil and gas properties. The technical person at CG&A primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve estimate with respect to the Trust is Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been a practicing petroleum engineering consultant since 1989, with over 26 years of practice experience in petroleum engineering. He is a registered professional engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055). He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987, summa cum laude, with a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering. CG&A and Mr. Meekins have indicated that they meet or exceed all requirements set forth in Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
The following table presents a reconciliation of proved reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty from December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2014, (in thousands):
Estimated quantities of proved developed oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):
A summary of estimated quantities by geographic area for total proved and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
Based on information provided by Burlington, there were 36 PUDs identified as of December 31, 2014, as compared to 30 as of December 31, 2013. This estimate does not include two PUDs previously identified but not drilled within five years from date of booking. For the year ended December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 0.1 Mbbls of oil and 52 MMcf of gas were converted from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
The current estimate has also been adjusted to take into account the elimination of PUDs no longer deemed commercially viable due to declines in the market price of natural gas, as well as new PUDs identified during the year and those converted to proved developed, all in the ordinary course of business. See the discussion of historical and budgeted investment and progress to convert PUDs to proved developed under Producing Acreage, Wells, and Drilling in this Item 2. Properties, above.
Generally, the calculation of oil and gas reserves takes into account a comparison of the value of the oil or gas to the cost of producing those minerals, in an attempt to cause minerals in the ground to be included in reserve estimates only to the extent that the anticipated costs of production will be exceeded by the anticipated sales revenue. Accordingly, an increase in sales price and/or a decrease in production cost can itself result in an increase in estimated reserves and declining prices and/or increasing costs can result in reserves reported at less than the physical volumes actually thought to exist. The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires supplemental disclosures for oil and gas producers based on a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities. Under this disclosure, future cash inflows are estimated by applying annual average prices of oil and gas relating to the enterprise’s proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future price changes are only considered to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is achieved by using a discount rate of 10% a year to reflect the timing of future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.
Estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are by their nature imprecise. Estimates of future net revenue attributable to proved reserves are sensitive to the unpredictable prices of oil and gas and other variables. Accordingly, under the allocation method used to derive the Trust’s quantity of proved reserves, changes in prices will result in changes in quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues.
The 2014, 2013, and 2012 changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to future Royalty Income from proved reserves are as follows (in thousands):
Reserve quantities and revenues shown in the tables above for the Royalty were estimated from projections of reserves and revenues attributable to the combined Burlington and Trust interests. Reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty were derived from estimates by allocating to the Royalty a portion of the total net reserve quantities of the interests, based upon gross revenue less production taxes. Because the reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty are estimated using an allocation of the reserves, any changes in prices or costs will result in changes in the estimated reserve quantities allocated to the Royalty. Therefore, the reserve quantities estimated will vary if different future price and cost assumptions occur. The future net cash flows were determined without regard to future federal income tax credits, if any, available to production from coal seam wells.
For 2014, $4.68 per Mcf of gas and $81.09 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of $4.35 per MMBtu of Henry Hub natural gas and $94.99 per Bbl of West Texas Intermediate oil. The upward revision in reserve quantities for 2014 is due primarily to higher natural gas prices and lower lease operating expense.
For 2013, $3.98 per Mcf of gas and $84.86 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of $3.67 per MMBtu of Henry Hub natural gas and $96.94 per Bbl of West Texas Intermediate oil. The upward revision in reserve quantities for 2013 is due primarily to higher natural gas prices.
For 2012, $3.30 per Mcf of gas and $82.87 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu of Henry Hub natural gas and $94.71 per Bbl of West Texas Intermediate oil. The downward revision in reserve quantities for 2012 is due to the natural decline in the production from the properties as well as lower average gas prices during 2012 as compared to 2011.
The following presents estimated future net revenues and present value of estimated future net revenues attributable to the Royalty for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in thousands, except amounts per Unit):
Estimated quantities of proved reserves increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gas prices and lower lease operating expense in 2014. Proved reserve quantities are estimates based on information available at the time of preparation and such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of those reserves may be substantially different from the above estimates. Moreover, the present values shown above should not be considered the market values of such oil and gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to acquire equivalent reserves. A market value determination would require the analysis of additional parameters. Reserve estimates were not filed with any Federal authority or agency other than the SEC.
Regulation
Many aspects of the production, pricing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas are regulated by federal and state agencies. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on affected members of the industry.
Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Natural gas and oil operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations that regulate the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled and unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum allowable production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of natural gas and oil that Burlington can produce and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which Burlington can drill.
Federal Natural Gas Regulation
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce, historically, have been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and its predecessor. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact controls in the future.
Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts. The Trust cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective, or their effect, if any, on the Trust. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach to natural gas sales pursued over the last two decades by FERC and Congress will continue.
Sales of crude oil, condensate and gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The ability to transport and sell petroleum products depends on pipelines that transport such gas in interstate commerce and whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act.
Section 45 Tax Credit
Sales of gas production from certain coal seam wells drilled prior to January 1, 1993, qualified for federal income tax credits under Section 29 (now Section 45K) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the “Code”) through 2002 but not thereafter. Accordingly, under present law, the Trust’s production and sale of gas from coal seam wells does not qualify for tax credit under Section 45K of the Code (the “Section 45 Tax Credit”). Congress has at various times since 2002 considered energy legislation, including provisions to reinstate the Section 45 Tax Credit in various ways and to various extents, but no legislation that would qualify the Trust’s current production for such credit has been enacted. No prediction can be made as to what future tax legislation affecting Section 45K of the Code may be proposed or enacted or, if enacted, its impact, if any, on the Trust and the Unit Holders.
Passive Loss Rules
The classification of the Trust’s income for purposes of the passive loss rules may be important to a Unit Holder. As a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, royalty income such as that derived through the Trust will generally be treated as portfolio income that may not be offset or reduced by passive losses.
Climate Change Regulation
The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with federal, state and local regulations and laws regarding the effects of climate change. These laws and regulations have impacted, and will in the future continue to impact, the production, gathering, marketing and transportation of oil and natural gas.
Other Regulation
The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including, but not limited to, environmental protection, occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity.
ITEM 3.
