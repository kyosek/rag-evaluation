Footnotes to Property List (dollars in thousands except per square foot amounts):
(a)
Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases expiring December 31, 2015 aggregating 69,522 square feet (representing 0.3 percent of the Company’s total net rentable square footage) for which no new leases were signed.
(b)
Total base rent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Substantially all of the commercial leases provide for annual base rents plus recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant’s proportionate share of and/or increases in real estate taxes and certain operating costs, as defined, and the pass through of charges for electrical usage. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, total escalations and recoveries from tenants were: $49,480, or $3.11 per leased square foot, for office properties; $10,213, or $2.33 per leased square foot, for office/flex properties; and $1,769, or $4.30 per leased square foot, for other properties.
(c)
Excludes space leased by the Company.
(d)
Base rent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 divided by net rentable commercial square feet leased at December 31, 2015.
(e)
Total base rent for 2015 minus 2015 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP, divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2015.
(f)
This property is located on land leased by the Company.
(g)
As this property was acquired, commenced initial operations or initially consolidated by the Company during the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, the amounts represented in 2015 base rent reflect only that portion of those 12 months during which the Company owned or consolidated the property. Accordingly, these amounts may not be indicative of the property’s full year results. For comparison purposes, the amounts represented in 2015 average base rent per sq. ft. and per unit for this property have been calculated by taking the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 base rent for such property and annualizing these partial-year results, dividing such annualized amounts by the net rentable square feet leased or occupied units at December 31, 2015. These annualized per square foot and per unit amounts may not be indicative of the property’s results had the Company owned or consolidated the property for the entirety of the 12 months ended December 31, 2015.
(h)
Acquired on November 12, 2015. Amounts reflect period of ownership.
(i)
Annualized base rent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 divided by units occupied at December 31, 2015, divided by 12.
(j)
Excludes $7.8 million from properties which were sold during the year ended December 31, 2015.
