Canndescent is a premium flower brand for luxury cannabis in California. The Canndescent Lease requires Canndescent to pay all property related expenses including maintenance, insurance and taxes. The rent for the Canndescent Lease is structured to provide straight-line annual rent of approximately $1,074,000.
On March 12, 2021, we acquired a property (the “Gas Station Property”) for $85,000 located in southern Colorado through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary (“PW Gas Station”) of our wholly owned subsidiary which is comprised of 2.2 acres. As part of the transaction, we agreed to fund the immediate construction of an approximately 24,512 square foot greenhouse and processing facility for approximately $2.1 million including the land acquisition cost. Concurrent with the acquisition, PW Gas Station entered into a 20-year “triple-net” lease (the “Gas Station Lease”) with The Gas Station, LLC (“Gas Station”) which will operate a cannabis cultivation facility. The lease requires Gas Station to pay all property related expenses including maintenance, insurance and taxes. After the initial 20-year term, Gas Station Lease provides two, five-year renewal options. The lease also has a personal guarantee from the owners of Gas Station and they intend to operate the Gas Station Property as a licensed cannabis cultivation and processing facility. The rent for the Gas Station Lease is structured whereby after an eight-month free-rent period, the rental payments provide Power REIT a full return of invested capital over the next three years in equal monthly payments. After the 43rd month, rent is structured to provide a 13.3% return on the original invested capital amount which will increase at a 3% rate per annum. At any time after year six, if cannabis is legalized at the federal level, the rent will be readjusted down to an amount equal to a 9% return on the original invested capital amount and will increase at a 3% rate per annum based on a starting date of the start of year seven.
