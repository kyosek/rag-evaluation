Production and Development Properties
Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
North America
Nevada, USA. We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.7 million ounces for 2011 with ore mined from seven open pit and eight underground mines. At December 31, 2011, we reported 34.7 million ounces
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
of gold reserves in Nevada, with 77% of those ounces in open pit mines and 23% in underground mines. We are advancing several development opportunities in Nevada, including Long Canyon, with significant reserve expansion potential.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 79% of Nevada’s gold production in 2011, compared with 79% in 2010 and 77% in 2009. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately 85% are refractory ores and 15% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores are processed at Carlin by flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site.
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.
In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals.
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold production of 44,000 ounces in 2011, 38,000 ounces in 2010 and 39,000 ounces in 2009 were attributable to Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.
We had ore sale agreements with Yukon-Nevada Gold Corporation (“Yukon-Nevada”) and Barrick to process the Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 47,000 ounces in 2011, 15,000 ounces in 2010 and 700 ounces in 2009, pursuant to these agreements.
On April 6, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold Inc. (“Fronteer”). Fronteer owned among other assets, the exploration stage Long Canyon project, which is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and we believe provides the potential for significant development and operating synergies. During 2011, the project entered into the pre-feasibility stage as we further develop our understanding of what we expect could be another Carlin-type trend at Long Canyon. We have received an expanded exploration area permit
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
allowing access to project targets. We continue to make progress on the drilling program. A total of 72 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2011 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2012. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017 with initial estimated gold production of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 ounces per year.
Mexico. We have a 44% interest in the La Herradura joint venture and related gold properties (Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena), which are located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. Herradura, located in Sonara, Mexico has been in operation since 1998. Soledad-Dipolos is located 9 kilometers northwest of Herradura and commenced operations in January, 2010. Noche Buena is located 23 kilometers northwest of Herradura and operations are expected to commence in the first half of 2012. La Herradura produced 212,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 2.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
South America
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. MYSRL may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable. During 2011, Peru enacted a new mining tax and royalty regime, replacing a 3.75% voluntary contribution that expired in 2010. Beginning October 1, 2011, mining companies are subject to a revised royalty and special mining tax, dependent on whether or not a stabilization agreement is in effect. The revised royalty and special mining taxes are based on a sliding scale and are expected to be 5% to 7%.
Yanacocha, Peru. Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has active open pit mines at Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha, and in 2011, mining operations were reinitiated at Maqui Maqui and Carachugo. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2011 was 1.3 million ounces (728,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2011 we reported 4.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Conga, Peru. The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. In July 2011, the project progressed infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering and procurement of equipment and materials. Construction activities were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru’s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved in October 2010, will be reviewed by independent experts, in an effort to resolve the alleged concerns around the environmental viability of Conga. Construction will remain suspended for the duration of the review, however, progress continues on engineering and procurement. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If the project proceeds, average annual estimated attributable gold production of
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
approximately 300,000 to 350,000 ounces and average annual estimated attributable copper production of approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year are expected during the first five years of production. At December 31, 2011, we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves.
La Zanja, Peru. We hold a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold mine near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. The site consists of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 64,000 attributable gold ounces in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported 0.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Merian, Suriname. We hold a 50% interest in the Merian gold project, a joint venture with a subsidiary of Alcoa. We will earn an 80% interest on completion of the feasibility study, which commenced in the third quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Once we earn our 80% interest, Alcoa may, within 30 days, elect to purchase a 10% interest in the joint venture from us (reducing our interest to 70%). If Alcoa elects this option, it will be required to solely fund the joint venture expenditures in an amount equal to two-thirds of the expenditures we incurred to complete the feasibility study. Negotiations with the government of Suriname on a mineral agreement are continuing, which may affect our equity participation in the project.
Asia Pacific
Australia/New Zealand. In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights. A carbon dioxide tax will commence in Australia beginning July 1, 2012, whereby the largest emitters of carbon dioxide will be required to pay A$23.00 per metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The carbon price is indexed for inflation through June 30, 2015, when a cap and trade system will be in place. Carbon costs will primarily be driven by electricity and diesel fuel consumption.
Boddington. Boddington (100% owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 741,000 ounces of gold and 69 million pounds of copper in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 19.5 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,260 million pounds of copper reserves.
Kalgoorlie. Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in terms of gold production and annual tons mined. During 2011, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 750,000 ounces of gold (375,000 attributable ounces), and at December 31, 2011 we reported 4.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Jundee. Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from underground sources in 2011, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 333,000 ounces of gold in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported 0.6 million ounces of gold reserves.
Tanami. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. In July 2011, a project to develop a shaft to support underground operations was approved by the Board of Directors. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cut-off grade, enhance productivity and facilitate possible additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces per year during the first five years of production. First production is expected in 2015. During 2011, the Tanami operations produced 221,000 ounces of gold and at December 31, 2011 we reported 2.5 million ounces of gold reserves.
Waihi. Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and currently consists of the Favona and Trio (currently under development) underground deposits and the Martha open pit mine. The Waihi operation produced 97,000 ounces of gold in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported 0.4 million ounces of gold reserves.
Duketon. We have a 16.85% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold mine, located approximately 200 miles northeast of Kalgoorlie. Duketon commenced production in the third quarter of 2010 and produced 17,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2011. At December 31, 2011, we reported 0.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2011, Batu Hijau produced 283 million pounds of copper (137 million attributable pounds) and 318,000 ounces of gold (154,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2011, we reported 3,730 million attributable pounds of copper reserves and 3.6 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.
We own 31.50% of the Batu Hijau mine through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which we own with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine. The remaining 44% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), 24%; P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), 17.8%; and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), 2.2%.
On May 6, 2011, we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake, as required under the terms of PTNNT’s Contract of Work with the Indonesian Government. NTPBV entered into the agreement with Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”). The Government of Indonesia designated PIP as the buyer for the final 7% interest by exercising a right of first refusal set out in the Contract of Work. Upon closing of the transaction, NTPBV’s interest in Batu Hijau will be reduced to 49%, as required under the Contract of Work. The price agreed for the 7% stake is approximately $247. Closing of the transaction is pending receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was required to allow PIP to make the share purchase. The Ministry of Finance continues to dispute the need for parliamentary approval and further disputes may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares. NTPBV and PIP agreed to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions of the agreement until May 6, 2012. Our ownership interest in PTNNT following the closing of the transaction will be 27.56%.
We have identified Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. We have financing arrangements with PTPI and PTIMI, unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011 in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be VIEs and our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% (20% interest net of withholding tax) to 48.50% during 2010. We currently provide management for the Batu Hijau operation and our standards are applied at Batu Hijau.
In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
Under the Contract of Work our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the future to as low as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTPBV in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Hijau or apply our operating standards. As part of the negotiation of the divestiture sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the right of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards at Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to our standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTPBV owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we could lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by us. Such loss of control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Africa
Ahafo, Ghana. Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 operating and planned pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo produced 566,000 ounces of gold in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 12.1 million ounces of gold reserves.
Akyem, Ghana. Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. The Akyem project is advancing with awarding of 95% of all construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks, major civil work and underground utilities. The first structural concrete was placed in August 2011. Establishment of the first set of households at the resettlement villages took place in October 2011. First production is anticipated in late 2013 to early 2014, with approximately three to six months expected for ramp-up from construction completion to commercial production. Gold production is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year for the first five years of the mine’s operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). At December 31, 2011, we reported 7.4 million ounces of gold reserves.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The Investment Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Investment Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009, the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are pending, we have paid and included $39 in Income and mining tax expense to date under the levy.
In 2011, the Minister of Finance proposed the following changes in Ghana’s tax laws: (i) an increase in the corporate income tax from 25% to 35%, (ii) the elimination of the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, (iii) the introduction of a windfall tax of 10% and (iv) a change in capital allowances to 20% over 5 years from the previously allowed 80% deduction in year one and then 50% per year on the remaining balance. Per our Investment Agreement, the increase in the corporate income tax rate would be limited to 32.5% and the windfall tax of 10% would not be applicable to our Ghana operations.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
In addition, the government of Ghana recently established a National Re-Negotiation Team to review fiscal regimes and mining agreements with a view to ensuring that Ghana benefits adequately and fairly from gains in the mining sector. As a result, our Investment Agreement could be subject to requests for renegotiation by the government of Ghana. See Risk Factor “Our operations are subject to risks of doing business” for a description of risks inherent in contracts with governments.

Proven and Probable Reserves
We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 98.8 million ounces at December 31, 2011, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce. Our 2011 reserves would decline by approximately 5% (4.7 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,100 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to $1,300 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 4% (3.9 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2010, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce.
At December 31, 2011, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 37.0 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end proven and probable gold reserves were 61.8 million ounces, including 31.5 million ounces in Asia Pacific, 19.5 million ounces in Africa and 10.8 million ounces in South America.
Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2011 were 9,720 million pounds. For 2011, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.00 or A$3.15 per pound, increased from $2.50 or A$2.95 per pound, used in 2010.
Our proven and probable silver reserves at December 31, 2011 were 195 million ounces. For 2011, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $22.00 or A$23.00 per ounce. Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations. While details of silver reserves were not provided in 2010, reserves disclosed in footnotes used price assumptions of $15.00 or A$17.50 per ounce in 2010.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2012, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2012.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
(1) The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2011 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2010 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
