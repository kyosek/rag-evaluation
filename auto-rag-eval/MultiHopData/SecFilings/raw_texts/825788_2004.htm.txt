Item 2. Properties
Original lease terms for the majority of the investment properties are generally 10 - 20 years from their inception. All leases are triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating costs including maintenance, repairs, utilities, property taxes, and insurance. A majority of the leases contain percentage rent provisions, which require the tenant to pay a specified percentage (6% to 8%) of gross sales above a threshold amount.
The Partnership owned the following Properties (including specialty leasehold improvements for use in some of these properties) as of December 31, 2004:
Footnotes:
(1) Purchase price includes all costs incurred to acquire the property.
(2) Purchase price includes cost of specialty leasehold improvements.
(3) Renewal option available at tenant’s option.
(4) Ownership of lessee’s interest under a ground lease. The tenant is responsible for payment of all rent obligations under the ground lease.
The following summarizes significant developments, by property, for properties with such developments.
Popeye’s- Park Forest, IL
The tenant has remained current on its monthly lease obligations. However, the tenant was delinquent on its January 2002 percentage rent billing for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $72,000 and its February 2003 percentage rent billing for the year ended December 21, 2002 of $31,500. Management continued to pursue legal remedies in relation to the collection of the tenant’s percentage rent past due balance of approximately $103,500, however, due to the uncertainty of collection, the entire amount was fully reserved in the Fourth Quarter of 2003. In addition, through October 31, 2004 Management had charged Popeye’s late fees totaling $93,000 (which includes 2004, 2003 and 2002 late fee charges of $41,000, $35,000 and $17,000, which were not recognized as revenue due to uncertainty of collection) in relation to the percentage rent balances due. The tenant was delinquent on its reporting of its 2003 monthly sales figures and therefore percentage rents for the year ended December 31, 2003 were not accrued by the Partnership at December 31, 2003. The delinquent 2003 sales figures were received by Management in June 2004 and Popeye’s 2003 percentage rent of approximately $19,000 was then billed in the Third Quarter of 2004. However, due to the uncertainty of collection it was determined that the amount would not be recognized as revenue for financial statement purposes until such time as the rent was collected. Popeye’s did not exceed its gross sales breakpoint in 2004 and therefore percentage rent was not recorded in 2004 for the tenant.
Per the lease and its amendments (“Lease”), Popeye’s is to timely pay as they come due all taxes charged to the property. However, the tenant failed to pay the 2002 property taxes of approximately $40,000, which were due and payable to Cook County, Illinois in 2003, as well as approximately $5,000 in assessed late fees. In the Fourth Quarter of 2003 the Partnership accrued approximately $86,000 in property taxes, which included the 2002 property taxes and associated late fees, as well as the estimated 2003 property taxes that were to be due in 2004. The 2002 property taxes and late fees were paid by the Partnership in January 2004 and the first and second installments for the 2003 taxes were paid in February and September 2004, respectively. In March 2004 Management learned that the tenant had also failed to pay the $31,000 second installment of its 2001 property taxes. The Partnership paid the 2001 delinquent property taxes, as well as approximately $10,000 in assessed late fees, in March 2004.
A Landlord’s 10 Day Notice Of Default (“Notice”), dated February 9, 2004, was sent to Quality Foods I, LLC., the Popeye’s tenant, demanding payment of the amount due for the 2002 property tax balance and unless payment was received by the Partnership on or before the expiration of ten (10) days after the date of service of the Notice, then the Partnership would pursue all legal remedies available, including an action to recover possession and termination of the Lease. The Notice also stated that until such time the Lease is terminated, the tenant’s other legal obligations (outstanding percentage rents and future monthly rents) continue in full.
In March 2004 the Partnership’s legal counsel obtained a court order of possession that stated that Popeye’s was to vacate the property by April 2, 2004. In April 2004 Management entered into a verbal agreement with Popeye’s that the tenant: (1) pay $25,000 by wire or certified check per month until the Partnership is reimbursed in full for the approximately $107,000 in delinquent property taxes paid on Popeye’s behalf (the Partnership received $25,000 in each April, May, June, and July 2004 and received the final payment of approximately $7,000 in September 2004); and (2) fund the $22,000 2003 property tax second installment due in the Fourth Quarter 2004 through prorated monthly escrow payments made to the Partnership from April through September 2004 (the Partnership received approximately $17,000 of the $22,000 in September 2004 and the remaining balance in November 2004). If the tenant adhered to this verbal agreement, Management intended to re-evaluate outstanding percentage rents relative to appropriate and sustainable occupancy costs and defer any current action for possession.
A Release and Settlement Agreement was executed with Popeye’s in November 2004. In settlement of all claims and disputes (Popeye’s past due 2001 and 2002 percentage rent balances and the applicable allowances were removed from the balance sheet at November 30, 2004), the following significant items were agreed to: (1) Popeye’s is to make monthly escrow property tax payments applicable to 2004 and for future property taxes due through out the remaining lease term obligation; (2) Popeye’s gross sales breakpoint was increased to $1,000,000 and therefore, percentage rent shall be an amount equal to 8% of gross sales in excess of $1,000,000.
Popeye’s 2004 estimated property taxes have been prorated and accrued on a monthly basis by the Partnership. In September 2004 the Partnership began billing Popeye’s monthly property tax escrow charges. Escrow payments of approximately $7,400 were received by the Partnership in December 2004 and January 2005 in relation to Popeye’s 2004 property taxes due in the year 2005. In 2004 property tax escrow charges were reflected in the financial statements as escrow payments were actually received, and were recorded as a reversal of 2004 property tax expense equal to the amount of payment received.
Miami Subs- Palm Beach, FL Property
A sales contract was executed in January 2004 for the sale of the property in the Second Quarter of 2004 at a sales price of $650,000. The closing date on the sale of the property was June 2004 and the net sales proceeds totaled approximately $606,000. A net gain on the sale of $211,000 was recognized in the Second Quarter of 2004. Closing and other sale related costs amounted to $44,000, which included sales commissions totaling $39,000, of which $19,500 was paid to a General Partner affiliate and $19,500 was paid to a non-affiliated broker.
At the time of closing the former tenant, DiFede Finance Group (“DiFede”), was delinquent $17,000 in past rent (after the application of a $15,000 security deposit). The former tenant also owed the Partnership approximately $13,360 in real estate taxes as the Partnership paid the property’s delinquent 2003 real estate taxes in June 2004. Management continued to pursue legal remedies to collect the former tenant’s total past due balances. Due to the uncertainty of collection, fifty percent (50 %) of the total outstanding receivable balance was reserved in June 2004.
In November 2004 a Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) was executed with DiFede. Per the Agreement the former tenant agreed to pay the Partnership by December 31, 2004 approximately $36,000 in past due rent, late charges, related attorney and court fees and other miscellaneous items. However, the settlement payment per the Agreement has not been received by the Partnership. Further legal action was taken by the Partnership and the Circuit Court in Broward County, Florida entered a final judgment (the “Judgment”) against DiFede in early January 2005, awarding approximately $42,000 in damages to the Partnership. Due to the uncertainty of collection, the remaining fifty percent (50 %) of the total outstanding receivable balance was written-off. The receivable balance and applicable allowance were removed from the balance sheet at December 31, 2004.
4785 Merle Hay Road- Des Moines, IA
In July 2004 the Partnership paid Daytona’s- All Sports Café’s delinquent 2002 property taxes balance of approximately $15,000. Daytona’s reimbursed the Partnership $5,000 in each August, September and October. Due to the property tax default Management requested that Daytona’s begin escrowing for their next property tax installment, which will be due in the First Quarter of 2005, with the Partnership. Escrow payments of approximately $800 were held by the Partnership at December 31, 2004.
The lease on the property in Des Moines, IA expired on December 31, 2002. In October 2002 Hickory Park, Inc. informed Management that they would not be renewing the property lease. However, in January 2003 Management was notified that the sub-tenant, Daytona’s- All Sports Cafe, did not vacate the Des Moines property and was continuing to operate the property as a restaurant. Management allowed the sub-tenant a holdover lease for two months, and the Partnership received the January and February 2003 rent payments from Daytona’s applicable to the holdover lease. In March 2003 Management executed a five (5) year direct lease with Daytona’s, which is set to expire in 2008. The first year base rent was $60,000. A leasing commission of $9,700 was paid to an affiliate of the General Partner in March 2003 upon the execution of the lease.
Twin Falls, ID property
In August 2004 the Partnership sold a piece of land adjacent to the former Twin Falls property for $5,000. The land had no recorded value.
In February 2003 Management entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the vacant Twin Falls property at a sales price of $565,000. The closing date on the sale of the property was August 22, 2003 and the net sales proceeds totaled $530,000. A net gain of $215,000 was recognized in the Third Quarter of 2003 upon the sale. Closing and other sale related costs amounted to $35,000, which included sales commissions of $22,000 to a non-affiliated broker and $11,000 to a General Partner affiliate in the Third Quarter of 2003.
During the Fourth Quarter of 2001, the Bankruptcy court granted the motion of Phoenix Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Phoenix”) to reject the lease with the Partnership at the Twin Falls, Idaho location. The lease was terminated and rent income ceased in the Fourth Quarter of 2001. Although Phoenix had rejected the lease, its subtenant, Fiesta Time, maintained possession of the property. Management, therefore, took legal action to evict Fiesta Time from the Twin Falls property. In the Fourth Quarter of 2002, a judgment was entered in Magistrate Court evicting Fiesta Time. However, Fiesta Time appealed the action to District Court and the Court upheld the judgment in February 2003. The Partnership then received $30,000 in past rent that the court had required Fiesta Time to escrow during the court proceedings.

Former Mulberry Street Grill property- Phoenix, AZ
During April 2001, the sub-tenant AMF Corporation notified Management of its intent to close and vacate its Mulberry Street Grill restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Although the lease on the property was not set to expire until 2007, monthly rental and Common Area Maintenance (CAM) income ceased as of June 1, 2001. The past
due amount of $10,000 was reserved in the Fourth Quarter of 2001, due to its uncertainty of collection. Management moved forward with all legal remedies to collect the balances due from AMF, however, Management learned in the Third Quarter of 2002 that AMF had filed for bankruptcy and that the bankruptcy court had released AMF from all of its debts. The Partnership owned the building in Phoenix, Arizona occupied by the Mulberry Street Grill restaurant, however, the land upon which the building was located was leased (the “Ground Lease”) to the Partnership by the Ground Lease Landlord, Centre at 38th Street, L.L.C, (“Centre”.) During the Second Quarter of 2001 Management returned possession of the property to Centre and as such the net asset value of the property was written-off in the Fourth Quarter of 2001, resulting in a loss of $157,000.

In the Second Quarter of 2001, Centre filed suit against the Partnership and TPG (as General Partner) seeking possession of the property and damages for breach of the Ground Lease. In April 2002, an additional $43,000 was accrued as payable to Centre, due to the Court’s granting a summary judgment of $93,000 against the Partnership. In June 2002 the Partnership filed an appeal with respect to this judgment. In September 2002, the Partnership was required to escrow a $140,000 cash bond at the clerk of the court during the appeal process. A Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Agreement”) was made and entered into as of February 1, 2003. According to the terms of the Agreements the Partnership was required to pay Centre $115,000 (the “Settlement”) to discharge all claims of Centre against the Partnership and TPG (except for violations of environmental laws.) The court returned the $140,000 cash bond to the Partnership in April 2003. (See Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to Financial Statements and Part I- Item 3.
