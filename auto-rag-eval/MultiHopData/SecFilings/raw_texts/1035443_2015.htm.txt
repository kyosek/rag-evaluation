ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2015, we had 199 properties containing approximately 20.1 million RSF of operating properties and development and redevelopment projects under construction or pre-construction, including eight consolidated real estate joint ventures and two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Property statistics presented are for our managed properties, which includes both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties at 100% of each property’s respective ABR and RSF, unless otherwise noted. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 97.2% as of December 31, 2015. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of science and technology tenants. These improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:
•
Reinforced concrete floors;
•
Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•
Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•
Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•
Enhanced environmental control technology;
•
Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•
Laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2015, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of 28 properties that accounted for approximately 14% of our total number of properties. Of the 28 properties, we held 15 properties in the Greater Boston market, five properties in the San Francisco market, two properties in the New York City market, one property in the Maryland market, two properties in the Research Triangle Park market, and three properties in the Asia market pursuant to ground leasehold interests. As of December 31, 2015, our asset base also contained two land parcels in North America and two land parcels in India, which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests. Refer to further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2015, we had 568 leases with a total of 425 tenants, and 87, or 44%, of our 199 properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of five to 10 years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2015:
•
Investment-grade tenants represented 54% of our total ABR;
•
Approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;
•
Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and
•
Approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.

LEED certifications
We strive to maximize the environmental efficiency of our properties. We closely manage the development, redevelopment, and operating stages of many of our properties, from design and construction to maintenance of our buildings, to achieve environmentally and resource efficient assets. The LEED rating systems developed by the U.S. Green Building Council allow building owners to measure this efficiency. Building projects must satisfy multiple prerequisites to achieve different levels of LEED certification and recognition.
(1) Upon completion of 19 in-process LEED certification projects.
Investments in real estate
Our investments in real estate consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts):
Square foot amounts include 100% of properties managed by us.
(1)
The per square foot amounts represent our investment in our real estate including our partners’ share of consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, divided by 100% of the rentable or developable square feet of the respective property.
Development, redevelopment, and future value-creation projects
A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to Class A development and redevelopment projects located in collaborative science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable space to meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. A significant number of our active development and redevelopment projects are highly leased and expected to be substantially delivered in the near future, including 1.5 million RSF by the end of 2016. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, NOI, and cash flows, including $75 to $80 million of incremental annual NOI from projects placed in service by the end of 2016. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, and higher rental income and returns.
Development projects consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory and tech office space. We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of Class A office/laboratory and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had development and redevelopment projects targeted to be placed in service by the end of 2016, which were 89% pre-leased.
Predevelopment activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of predevelopment efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
Our initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of NOI upon stabilization and our investment in the property, and excludes the impact of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time and our average cash yields are expected, in general, to be greater than our initial stabilized yields (cash basis). Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner, if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs. Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term (s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis. Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed. Average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis. The stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
