ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Established Communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of January 1, 2007, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in, and that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For communities that we wholly own, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community’s acquisition cost. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
In addition, we own approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Alexandria, Virginia, for our corporate office, with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2008, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The Current Communities, as of January 31, 2009, include 125 garden-style (of
which 21 are mixed communities and include town homes), 22 high-rise and 17 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:
Other features at various communities may include:
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed construction of 4,036 apartment homes in 13 communities and sold 3,059 apartment homes in ten communities. In addition, the Fund sold 400 apartment homes in one community. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 14.0 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the average age of our Current Communities is 8.7 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2009, we own:
We also hold, directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in the 14
Development Communities, all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and three of which are subject to land leases expiring in September 2105, December 2105 and April 2106.
In our two partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2009, there were 19,430 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities
As of December 31, 2008, we had 14 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 4,564 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $1,583,800,000. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further discussion of our 2009 outlook for development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
This community is being financed in part by third party, tax-exempt debt.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2008, we had seven consolidated communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $95,400,000, excluding costs prior to redevelopment. In addition, the Fund has two communities under redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to Fund-owned communities, as well as communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Redevelopment Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.
(2)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
(3)
This community is owned by the Fund.
Development Rights
As of December 31, 2008, we are evaluating the future development of 27 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option. We generally prefer to hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 14 of the Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 7,304 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own. At December 31, 2008, there were cumulative capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $57,365,000 relating to Development Rights that we consider probable for future development. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $239,456,000 are reflected as land held for development as of December 31, 2008 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2008, we incurred a charge of approximately $12,500,000 of pre-development cost for development rights that we determined would not likely be developed.
Refer to Item I., “Business” for a discussion of our expected 2009 development starts. In addition, you should carefully review Section 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The table below presents a summary of these Development Rights:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
Land Acquisitions
We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2008, we acquired six land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $97,174,000, one of which we no longer plan to develop. The land parcels purchased, which are currently being developed or are held for future development, are as follows:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
This represents a portion of the aggregate land purchase that we will transact under a non-cancelable commitment related to this expected development, as discussed in Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
Recent Disposition Activity
We (i) sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a non-taxable, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009, we sold our interest in ten wholly owned communities, containing an aggregate of 3,059 apartment homes. The aggregate gross sales price from the dispositions of these assets was $564,950,000.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault and the Hayward Fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. We have in place with respect to communities located in California, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. Earthquake coverage outside of California is subject to a $100,000,000 limit, except with respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides
for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence except that the next $400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional deductible until the total deductible incurred exceeds $3,000,000.
On December 1, 2007, we elected to cancel and rewrite our property insurance policy for a 17 month term in order to take advantage of declining insurance premium rates. As a result, our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 15% with no material changes in coverage. We expect to renew this policy when it expires on May 1, 2009.
In August 2008, we renewed our general liability policy and worker’s compensation coverage for a one year term, and experienced a decrease in the premium on these policies of approximately 13%, with no material changes in the coverage. These policies are in effect until August 1, 2009.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In December 2007, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back-stop program until 2014. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIPRA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides TRIPRA coverage (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.
An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and the Company’s related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1a., “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance,” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) that protect the company, up to $5,000,000 per occurrence, from employee theft of money, securities or property.
