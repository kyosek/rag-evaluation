DIVERSIFIED TENANT BASE
Because our projects represent a collection of various retail formats under one roof, we believe that our tenant base represents one of the more diversified mixes of retailers in the industry today. This is evidenced by the fact that no tenant represents more than 3.6% of 1998 base rent. We further believe that the overall credit of our tenant base is strong given the diversity of our retailers and the large number of manufacturer outlet tenants. Our universe of tenants continues to expand.
The following table, which includes our joint venture projects (Ontario Mills, Grapevine Mills, Arizona Mills and The Block at Orange), sets forth certain information with respect to our ten largest tenants (as measured by 1998 base rent) as of December 31, 1998:
(1) Includes T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.
(2) Includes J.C. Penney and Rite Aid.
(3) Includes Burlington Coat Factory and Totally 4 Kids.

The Phase III expansion of Potomac Mills opened on September 30, 1993 and increased total gross leasable area by approximately 355,000 square feet.

THE MILLS CORPORATION SUMMARY OF OUTSTANDING CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS
(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1998
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had outstanding consolidated indebtedness in an aggregate amount of approximately $782.2 million (excluding its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt) as set forth below.
(1) This indebtedness is a 30 year amortizing loan with an anticipated balloon repayment on December 18, 2003. In the event the mortgage loan is not repaid by the anticipated balloon repayment date, the annual interest rate for each tranche will be increased by 2% per annum in excess of the stated interest rate. In addition, excess cash flow available after payment of the increased interest rate and scheduled amortization will be used to reduce the principal balance of the loan. Principal repayments are based on the scheduled amortization, assuming a 7% mortgage interest rate, over a 30 year period, with the monthly amortization payments being applied sequentially, beginning with Tranche A to reduce the principal balance.
(2) Optional payments of principal are not permitted prior to December 17, 1999. After such date, prepayments, in whole or in part, are permitted upon at least 15 days notice. In addition, the Company is required to pay a prepayment penalty equal to the greater of (i) 1% of the remaining principal balance or (ii) a yield preservation payment. Generally, yield preservation payments are intended to compensate the lender for the total amount of interest it would have earned on the indebtedness but for the repayment, less the amount of interest that the lender could earn if it invested the repayment amount in United States Treasury obligations or other similar securities from the date of the repayment through the maturity date of the indebtedness.
(3) This indebtedness is a 30 year amortizing loan with an anticipated balloon repayment on May 5, 2007. In the event the mortgage loan is not repaid by the anticipated balloon repayment date, the annual interest rate will be increased by 5% per annum in excess of the stated interest rate. In addition, excess cash flow available after payment of the increased interest rate and scheduled amortization will be used to reduce the principal balance of the loan.
(4) This indebtedness may be prepaid, without a prepayment penalty, beginning 180 days prior to May 5, 2007. Prior to that date, there is no right to prepay the indebtedness, except that $12.5 million of the principal balance, which has been allocated to the Liberty Plaza shopping center, may be defeased through the establishment of defeasance collateral (which may include government or agency securities that have the full faith and credit of the United States government). (5) Optional payments of principal on Tranche A of this indebtedness are not permitted prior to June 20, 2000 other than in connection with certain casualty or condemnation events occurring with respect to Sawgrass Mills. On and after such date, Tranche A may be prepaid in full, but not in part, without any prepayment penalty. Optional prepayments of Tranches B and C of the indebtedness may be made, in whole or in part, at any time without any prepayment penalty, but only if payments of interest are current with respect to each outstanding Tranche and an event of default is not then continuing.
(6) The loan agreement provides for a cap on LIBOR at 14% for the life of the loan.
(7) Calculated using 30-day LIBOR at 5.6406%, which was the rate at December 31, 1998.
(8) Prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time without prepayment penalty.
(9) This indebtedness may be prepaid, in whole or in part, upon 30 days notice to the lender and the payment of a prepayment penalty. The penalty percentage due on prepayment is 1.5% of the outstanding principal. During the last three months of its term, the indebtedness may be prepaid without penalty.
(10) Prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time, upon 60 days prior notice to the lender. The Company is required to pay a prepayment penalty, which would equal to the greater of (i) 1% of the principal balance, or (ii) a yield preservation payment.
(11) The total commitment under the Line of Credit is $100,000. Funds are available subject to certain performance measures and restrictive covenants. This loan bears interest at a variable rate ranging from 100 bp to 165 bp over LIBOR subject to certain leverage tests (LIBOR + 140 bp at 12/31/98). The line of credit matures April 1, 2000 with a one-year option to extend.
(12) Primarily corporate debt with maturities under one year. Prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time without prepayment penalty.
(13) Prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time, upon 3 days prior notice to lender without prepayment penalty.
(14) Prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time, upon 5 days prior notice to lender without prepayment penalty.
(15) Principal is guaranteed by the Company if the Phase II project fails to achieve a DSC ratio of 1.35 and a debt yield of 12.5%. As of December 31, 1998, the guaranteed amount was 0%.
(16) On January 27, 1999, the loans were repaid with the proceeds of a new $112,500 permanent loan. The new indebtedness is a 30 year amortizing loan with an anticipated balloon repayment date of February 1, 2009. Interest will accrue at a fixed rate of 7.30%.. In the event the mortgage is not repaid by the anticipated balloon repayment date, the interest rate will be the greater of (i) the loan interest rate plus 2% or (ii) the yield calculated by linear interpolation of the yields of noncallable United States Treasury obligations with terms (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating the period from such date of determination to the anticipated repayment date.
(17) The total commitment under this loan is $9,000. Funds are available subject to certain performance measures and restrictive covenants. Interest accrues at 200 bp over LIBOR. The indebtedness matures on December 31, 2000.
