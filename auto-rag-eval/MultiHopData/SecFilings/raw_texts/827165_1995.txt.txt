The Company's principal offices are located at 10670 North Central Expressway, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75231. In the opinion of the Company's management, the Company's offices are suitable and adequate for its present operations.
Details of the Company's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 1995, are set forth in Schedules III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." The discussions set forth below under the headings "Real Estate" and "Mortgage Loans" provide certain summary information concerning the Company's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 1995, the mortgage notes receivable secured by the Continental Hotel and Casino and by the Las Vegas Plaza Shopping Center, both of which are in Las Vegas, Nevada, net of applicable premiums, discounts, interest and deferred gains, each accounted for 11% of the Company's total assets. No other single asset of the Company accounted for 10% or more of its total assets. At December 31, 1995, 37% of the Company's assets consisted of real estate, 31% consisted of notes and interest receivable and 25% consisted of investments in the equity securities of CMET, IORI, TCI and NRLP. The remaining 7% of the Company's assets were invested in cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and other assets. The percentage of the Company's
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of the Company's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
At December 31, 1995, the Company's real estate was located in the Midwest, Southwest and Mountain regions of the continental United States, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below. The Company also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in various geographic regions of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Mountain region, as shown more specifically in the table under "Mortgage Loans" below.
Geographic Regions
The Company has divided the continental United States into the following six geographic regions.
Northeast region comprised of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, and the District of Columbia. The Company has no properties in this region.

Real Estate (Continued)
the continental United States, either on a leveraged or nonleveraged basis. The Company's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships, properties held for sale and investments in equity securities of CMET, IORI, TCI and NRLP.
Types of Real Estate Investments. The Company's real estate consists of commercial properties (office buildings, shopping centers and a merchandise mart) and hotels. In selecting new real estate investments, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Company may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of the Company's stockholders.
The Company intends to begin a major expansion of the Denver Merchandise Mart and renovation of the Inn at the Mart, both in Denver, Colorado, in 1996, if suitable financing can be obtained.
In the opinion of the Company's management, the properties owned by the Company are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of the Company's owned real estate (excluding the eight parcels of developed and undeveloped land, described below) at December 31, 1995.
The foregoing table is based solely on the commercial square footage and hotel rooms owned by the Company, and does not reflect the value of the Company's investment in each region. Excluded from the above table are 22 developed residential lots in a residential subdivision in Fort Worth, Texas, 2 parcels of partially developed land in Las Colinas, Texas totaling 160.6 acres, 3.5 acres of undeveloped land in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, and four additional parcels of land totaling approximately 426 acres.

Real Estate (Continued)
In November 1995, the Company obtained the Oak Tree Village, a 42,000 square foot shopping center in Lubbock, Texas, as a portion of a settlement with an insurance company. See "Mortgage Loans" below.
Properties held for sale. As of December 31, 1994, the Company reclassified from "Real estate held for investment" to "Real estate held for sale" the Boulevard Villas Apartments, a 303 unit apartment complex in Las Vegas, Nevada. In February 1995, the Company sold the apartment complex for $9.6 million. The Company initially treated the sale as a financing transaction, the Company having provided the purchaser with the $1.6 million down payment, by loaning a like amount, secured by a second lien on an office building in Houston, Texas. In March 1995, the office building was sold and the Company's loan was paid in full. The Company received net cash of $3.4 million from the sale of the apartment complex, after the payoff of $5.9 million in existing mortgage debt, recognizing a gain of $924,000 on the sale. The Company paid a real estate brokerage commission of $288,000 to Carmel Realty, an affiliate of BCM, the Company's advisor, based on the $9.6 million sales price.
In May 1995, the Company purchased a 74.9 acre parcel of partially developed land in Las Colinas, Texas, for $13.5 million. The Company paid a real estate brokerage commission of $405,000 to Carmel Realty based on the $13.5 million purchase price. In connection with the acquisition, the Company borrowed $15.0 million under a term loan, which bears interest at the prime rate plus 4%, (12.50% per annum at December 31, 1995), requires monthly interest only payments, a 1% annual maintenance fee, principal reduction payments of $1.5 million on the first day of November 1995 and May 1996 and $3.0 million every six months thereafter commencing November 1996, with the balance of principal and accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity on May 1, 1998. The term loan is secured by the land in Las Colinas, Texas, a participation interest in two of the Company's notes receivable, land in Atlanta, Georgia and a pledge of 586,800 NRLP units of limited partner interest owned by the Company. The Company received net financing proceeds of $210,000 after the purchase of the land and payment of associated closing costs. In June 1995, the Company borrowed an additional $3.0 million from this lender increasing the term loan principal balance to $18.0 million. The additional $3.0 million borrowing was paid in full prior to its March 31, 1996, maturity date as discussed below.
In September 1995, the Company sold 6.9 acres of the 74.9 acre parcel for $2.9 million in cash. In accordance with the provisions of the term loan, the Company applied the $2.6 million net proceeds of the sale to pay down the term loan. Such paydown was credited against the principal payments the Company was otherwise required to make in 1995 and 1996. The principal balance of the term loan was $15.5 million at December 31, 1995. The Company recognized a $1.5 million gain on the sale.
On February 2, 1996, the Company refinanced the $7.8 million of debt secured by its $18.0 million mortgage note receivable secured by the Las

Vegas Shopping Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, for $12.0 million. The Company received net refinancing proceeds of $2.3 million after the payment of closing costs associated with the refinancing and making a $1.5 million down on the term loan discussed above. Such $1.5 million payment was required to obtain the term loan lender's release of its lien on the Company's mortgage note receivable. The mortgage bears interest at 15% per annum, requires $151,733 monthly principal and interest payments, and matures February 6, 1998. The Company paid BCM a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $120,000 based upon the $12.0 million refinancing.
On March 11, 1996, the Company sold an additional 2.3 acres of the 74.9 acre parcel for $961,000 in cash. In accordance with the provisions of the term loan, the Company applied the net proceeds of the sale, $891,000, to pay down the term loan, $400,000 being applied to payoff the remaining balance owing on the $3.0 million principal payment due March 31, 1996, with the remaining $491,000 being applied against the principal payment of $1.5 million due in May 1996.
In October 1995, the Company purchased an additional tract of partially developed land in Las Colinas, Texas, totaling 92.6 acres for $7.1 million. The Company paid a real estate acquisition fee of $212,000 to Carmel Realty based on the $7.1 million purchase price. The Company paid $959,000 in cash and borrowed the remaining $6.1 million. The mortgage bears interest at the prime rate plus 5%, (13.50% at December 31, 1995), requires monthly interest only payments through September 30, 1996, four quarterly deferred commitment fee payments of $50,000 and $50,000 monthly principal reduction payments beginning October 1, 1996. The principal balance, accrued but unpaid interest and a $500,000 "maturity fee" is due at maturity on December 1, 1996. The Company has an option to extend the maturity date to October 1, 1997 if no event of default has occurred, written notice is given prior to maturity and the principal balance of the loan has been reduced by $2.1 million. The Company has also agreed to pledge to the lender, as additional collateral for the loan, $2.0 million of newly issued shares of the Company's Common Stock.
On February 13, 1996 the Company entered into a contract to sell 72.5 of the 92.6 acres for $12.9 million in cash. The contract calls for the sale to close in two phases. The first phase is to close on or before May 23, 1996 but may be extended to July 24, 1996, and the second phase is to close on or before December 31, 1996.
In 1991, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of a corporation which owned 198 developed residential lots in Fort Worth, Texas. Through December 31, 1994, 172 of the residential lots had been sold. During 1995, 4 additional lots were sold for an aggregate gain of $6,000. At December 31, 1995, 22 lots remained to be sold.
Also in 1991, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of a company which owned a 60% interest in a joint venture, which in turn

owned 113 partially developed residential lots in Denton, Texas. Through December 31, 1994, 109 of the residential lots had been sold. During 1995, the remaining four lots were sold for an aggregate gain of $24,000.
At December 31, 1995, the Company also owned 3.5 acres of undeveloped land in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, four additional parcels of land totaling approximately 426 acres and a fully depreciated office building in St. Louis, Missouri, all of which are held for sale. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income-producing real estate. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound, and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, the Company has acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1995 consisted of office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping centers, single-family residences, hotels and developed land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgages in which the Company invests without a vote of the Company's stockholders.
At December 31, 1995, the obligors on $13.0 million or 24% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of the Company. Also at that date, $1.8 million or 3% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio was in default.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance at December 31, 1995), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Company's mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1995.

A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1995 is as follows:
Loans in mortgage notes receivable portfolio at January 1 and December 31, 1995............................14*
- ---------------------
* Includes a mortgage note receivable collateralized by three condominium mortgage loans.
During 1995, the Company collected $4.9 million in interest and $1.6 million in principal on its mortgage notes receivable. The Company plans, for the foreseeable future, to hold, to the extent its liquidity permits, rather than to sell in the secondary market, the mortgage notes in its portfolio.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in first mortgage loans, with either short-, medium- or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Company's general policy to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1995.
In June 1991, the Company entered into an asset sales agreement with an insurance company whereby the Company sold real estate and participations in various of its assets in an effort to develop a potential source for future financing and to generate cash from otherwise illiquid assets. Assets transferred by the Company pursuant to the asset sales agreement included a retail shopping center in

Mortgage Loans (Continued)
Lubbock, Texas, with a carrying value of $2.0 million prior to transfer, a $1.5 million senior participation in a second lien mortgage note secured by the Las Vegas Plaza, a retail shopping center in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a carrying value of $18.8 million prior to transfer, a $315,000 participation in a first mortgage note secured by unimproved land in Virginia Station, Virginia and a $799,000 participation in a second lien mortgage note secured by the Country Club Apartments in Flagstaff, Arizona. In return, the Company received a $1.9 million participation in a first mortgage note secured by a hotel site in Lihue, Hawaii, a $1.0 million first mortgage note secured by land in Maricopa County, Arizona, a $118,000 first mortgage note secured by a single-family residence in Silver Creek, Colorado and $1.5 million in cash. The asset sales agreement contained put and guaranty provisions whereby, at any time, either party could demand that the seller reacquire any asset sold pursuant to the terms of the asset sales agreement for the consideration originally received. In March 1992, the Company received payment in full on the $118,000 note secured by the single- family residence in Silver Creek, Colorado.
In March 1992, the insurance company was placed in receivership and in June 1992, the Company provided notice to the insurance company, under the terms of the put and guaranty provisions of the asset sales agreement, of its desire to divest itself of all assets received. The Receiver refused to allow the enforcement of the put and guaranty provisions of the asset sales agreement.
In March 1992, the Company recorded a provision for loss of $496,000 to reduce the $1.0 million note receivable secured by land in Maricopa County, Arizona to its then estimated fair value. In June 1992, the Company foreclosed on the land. In September 1992, the Company recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the hotel site in Lihue, Hawaii, which secured a $1.9 million first mortgage participation received by the Company. In March 1995, the Company collected in full the second lien mortgage note secured by the Country Club Apartments, but did not remit such amount to the insurance company.
A settlement between the Company and the Receiver was approved by the court on February 15, 1995. Under the terms of the settlement, the insurance company returned to the Company all of the assets which it received from the Company, except for the participation in the first mortgage note secured by unimproved land in Virginia Station, Virginia. In exchange, the Company returned to the insurance company $1.0 million in cash and all the assets which it received from the insurance company, other than the note secured by the residence in Colorado which the Company had collected. The asset transfers and the Company's cash payment were completed in the fourth quarter of 1995. The Company incurred no loss on the settlement.
The borrower on a $1.7 million first mortgage note receivable secured by land in Osceola, Florida, failed to pay the note on its November 1, 1993 maturity. The Company instituted foreclosure proceedings and was awarded a summary judgment in January 1994. During 1994 and 1995, the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
borrower paid the Company a total of $270,000 in nonrefundable fees to delay foreclosure of the property until April 24, 1995. On April 21, 1995, the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. In July 1995, the Company filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to lift the court's stay and allow the Company to proceed with foreclosure. In September 1995, the bankruptcy court denied the Company's motion to lift stay and the borrower was allowed to file a plan of reorganization. The bankruptcy court has set a hearing date of May 15, 1996 for confirmation of the borrower's plan of reorganization. The note had a principal balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 1995. The Company does not expect to incur any loss if it is allowed to foreclose on the collateral property as its estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value of the note.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage note is a mortgage note having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make a first mortgage loan. The following discussion briefly describes events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1995.
In August 1990, the Company foreclosed on its fourth lien note receivable secured by the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company acquired the hotel and casino property at foreclosure subject to first and second lien mortgages totaling $10.0 million and a disputed third lien mortgage. In June 1992, the Company sold the hotel and casino to the third lienholder for a $22 million wraparound mortgage note receivable, a $500,000 unsecured note receivable, and $100,000 in cash. The $22 million note bears interest at 11% and was scheduled to mature June 19, 1995. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $4.3 million in connection with the sale of the hotel and casino resulting from the disputed third lien mortgage being subordinated to the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable. In April 1994, the Company, the borrower and the underlying lienholder agreed to modify and extend both the Company's wraparound note receivable and the underlying liens. The Company's modified wraparound mortgage note receivable and the underlying liens were scheduled to mature July 1, 1995. Subsequently, the Company, the borrower and the underlying lienholder again agreed to extend the wraparound mortgage note receivable and the underlying liens to December 31, 1995. A one percent extension fee was added to the principal balance of the wraparound mortgage note. The monthly payments on both the wraparound note and the first lien remained at $175,000 per month as did the other terms of the notes. The Company, the borrower and the underlying lienholder have again agreed to extend the Company's wraparound mortgage
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
note and underlying liens to July 1, 1996. A one percent extension fee was again added to the principal balance of the Company's wraparound mortgage note. The monthly payments on both the wraparound mortgage note and the first lien remained at $175,000 per month as did the other terms of the notes. The Company's modified wraparound note continues to accrue interest at 11% per annum with any unpaid interest being added monthly to the principal balance. The borrower is making payments in accordance with the terms of the modified note. The Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable had a principal balance of $22.7 million at December 31, 1995. The Company recognizes interest income on this wraparound mortgage note only to the extent interest is collected.
In conjunction with the modification of the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable, the underlying lienholder has agreed to forebear exercising its rights under the first and second liens on the condition that the Company continue to remit to it the greater of either $175,000 or all sums received by the Company on the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable. The Company remains in compliance with the terms of the forbearance agreement.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such notes are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such notes ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the note, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loans funded in 1995 and the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage notes during 1995.
At December 31, 1995, the Company held a mortgage note receivable secured by a third lien mortgage secured by a commercial property in South Carolina and personal guaranties of several individuals. The borrower has failed to make the required payments of principal and interest since December 1, 1994. The Company accelerated the note and instituted foreclosure proceedings as well as actions against the guarantors of the note. Effective September 1, 1995, the note was extended to September 1, 1996, requiring a $68,000 principal reduction payment, with the monthly interest, quarterly principal payments and all other terms remaining the same. The Company has received $43,000 of the required principal payment and is to receive the remaining $25,000 April 1, 1996. The principal balance of the note was $279,000 at December 31, 1995. The Company expects to incur no loss on the note in excess of the reserves previously provided.
The Company holds a junior mortgage note receivable secured by the Williamsburg Hospitality House in Williamsburg, Virginia, that is

subject to underlying liens totaling $11.7 million at December 31, 1995. In October 1993, the first lien debt was restructured and split in three pieces. During 1995, the Company advanced the borrower $3.3 million to payoff the then second lien, allowing the borrower to receive a $2.4 million discount offered by the lender for the early pay off of such lien. In conjunction with such advance, the Company extended the maturity of its note to April 1, 1996. All other terms of the note remained unchanged.
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships
The Company's investment in real estate entities includes (i) equity securities of three publicly traded REITs (collectively the "Trusts"), CMET, IORI and TCI, (ii) units of limited partner interest of NRLP, (iii) a general partner interest in NRLP and NOLP, through its 76.8% limited partner interest in SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, and (iv) interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. Gene E. Phillips, Chairman of the Board and a Director of the Company until November 16, 1992, serves as a director and Chief Executive Officer of SAMI, a company owned by BCM, which serves as SAMLP's managing general partner. Mr. Phillips is also a general partner of SAMLP. BCM serves as advisor to the Trusts, and performs certain administrative and management functions for NRLP and NOLP on behalf of SAMLP.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP in 1989, the Company has made additional investments in the equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The Company's cost with respect to shares of the Trusts at December 31, 1995 totaled $25.9 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $28.6 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of such equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP was $36.7 million at December 31, 1995 and the aggregate market value of such equity securities was $69.2 million. The aggregate
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
investee book value of the equity securities of the Trusts and the Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity based upon the December 31, 1995 financial statements of each such entity was $59.7 million and $161.5 million, respectively. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
In 1990, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and in May 1993 reaffirmed the expenditure by the Company of up to an aggregate of $17.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, additional units of NRLP and shares of the Trusts. In March 1995, the Company's Board of Directors increased such authorization to $25.0 million. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had expended $2.7 million to acquire additional units of NRLP and an aggregate of $4.5 million to acquire additional shares of the Trusts, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. The Company expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP.
At December 31, 1995, SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, owned 26,475 shares of TCI. The Company owns a 76.8% limited partnership interest in SAMLP which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes.
The purchases of the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP were made for the purpose of investment and were based principally on the opinion of the Company's management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination by the Company to purchase additional equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP is made on an entity-by-entity basis and depends on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of the Company's management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities. Substantially all of the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP owned by the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings.
Pertinent information regarding the Company's investment in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP, at December 31, 1995, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
* At December 31, 1995, NRLP reported a deficit partners' capital. The Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity, however, was $161.5
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
million. Revaluation equity is defined as the difference between the appraised value of the partnership's real estate, adjusted to reflect the partnership's estimate of disposition costs, and the amount of the mortgage notes payable and accrued interest encumbering such property as reported in NRLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.
Each of the Trusts and NRLP own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, particularly in the case of NRLP, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. The Company's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
The Company does not have a controlling equity interest in any of the Trusts and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of such investees. However, due to the Company's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of the Trusts, and that the Trusts have the same advisor as the Company and that Mr. Paulson, an Executive Officer of the Company, is also the President of the Trusts and BCM, the Company's advisor, and the President and a director of SAMI, a Company owned by BCM, that is the managing general partner of SAMLP, the Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of these entities. The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of these entities currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The Company continues to account for its investment in NRLP under the equity method due to the pending resignation of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP, as more fully discussed in "NRLP" below. The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of each entity's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of NRLP and the Trusts, based upon information publicly reported by such entities.
NRLP. NRLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership which was formed under the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act on January 29, 1987. It commenced operations on September 18, 1987 when, through NOLP, it acquired all of the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of 35 public and private limited partnerships sponsored by or otherwise related to Southmark Corporation ("Southmark"). NRLP is the sole limited partner of NOLP and owns 99% of the beneficial interest in NOLP. NRLP and NOLP operate as an economic unit and, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Partnership shall
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
constitute references to NRLP and NOLP as a unit. The general partner and owner of 1% of the beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP is SAMLP, a Delaware limited partnership. SAMI, a company owned by BCM, is the managing general partner of SAMLP. In November 1992, NOLP transferred 52 apartment complexes and a wraparound mortgage note receivable to Garden Capital, L.P. ("GCLP"), a Delaware limited partnership in which NOLP owns a 99.3% limited partner interest. Concurrent with such transfer, GCLP refinanced all of the mortgage debt associated with the transferred properties and the wraparound mortgage note under a new first mortgage in the amount of $223 million.
The Company is a limited partner in SAMLP, holding a 76.8% limited partner interest therein, which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes. Southmark owns a 19.2% limited partner interest in SAMLP. Gene E. Phillips and SAMI are the general partners of SAMLP.
SAMI, as the managing general partner of SAMLP, has discretion in determining methods of obtaining funds for the Partnership's operations, and the acquisition and disposition of its assets. The Partnership's governing documents place no limitation on the amount of leverage that the Partnership may incur either in the aggregate or with respect to any particular property or other investment. At December 31, 1995, the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the Partnership's real estate portfolio was 47.3% computed on the basis of the ratio of total property-related debt to aggregate appraised values.
As of December 31, 1995, NRLP owned 83 properties located in 22 states. These properties consisted of 67 apartment complexes comprising 16,848 units, seven office buildings with an aggregate of 495,594 square feet and nine shopping centers with an aggregate of 1.1 million square feet.
For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership reported net income of $3.8 million compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1994. The Partnership's net income in 1995 was attributable to a $7.7 million gain on the sale of two apartment complexes. The Partnership's net income in 1994 was attributable to a $8.3 million gain on the sale of two apartment complexes. The Partnership's loss from operations of $3.9 million in 1995 was a 21% increase when compared to its $3.2 million loss from operations in 1994. The increase is due in part to increased interest expense from an increase in the interest rate on $223 million of variable rate debt and increased borrowings resulting from debt refinancings in 1994 and 1995. The remainder of the increase is due to higher general and administrative expense as a result of higher legal and consulting fees related to the Moorman Settlement Agreement, discussed below. At December 31, 1995, the Partnership had total assets of $292.9 million which consisted of $229.5 million in real estate held for investment, $10.2 million in notes and interest receivable, net of allowance for estimated losses, $32.5 million in other assets and $20.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Partnership resumed quarterly distributions to unitholders. In 1995, the Company received a total of $719,000 in distributions from the Partnership. At December 31, 1995, the Company accrued $3.3 million in distributions from the Partnership that were paid January 2, 1996.
The Partnership, SAMLP, Mr. Phillips and William S. Friedman, a general partner of SAMLP until March 4, 1994, were among the defendants in a class action lawsuit arising out of the transactions discussed above whereby the Partnership was formed. An agreement settling such lawsuit as to the defendants, the Partnership, SAMLP and Messrs. Phillips and Friedman (the "Moorman Settlement Agreement"), became effective on July 5, 1990. The Moorman Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the appointment of an oversight committee for NRLP; the establishment of specified annually increasing targets for a five-year period relating to the price of NRLP units; a limitation and deferral or waiver of NRLP's reimbursement to SAMLP of certain future salary costs; and a deferral or waiver of certain future compensation to SAMLP; the required distribution to unitholders of all of the Partnership's cash from operations in excess of certain renovation costs unless the NRLP oversight committee approves alternative uses for such cash from operations; the issuance of unit purchase warrants to members of the plaintiff class; the contribution by certain co- defendants of cash and notes payable to the Partnership aggregating $5.5 million including $2.5 million contributed by SAMLP. The Partnership also agreed to pay certain settlement costs, including plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in the amount of $3.4 million. The settlement plan remains in effect until the withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The Moorman Settlement Agreement provides for the resignation and replacement of SAMLP as general partner if the price targets are not met for two consecutive anniversary dates. The Partnership did not meet the unit price targets for the first and second anniversary dates. On July 8, 1992, SAMLP notified the NRLP Oversight Committee of the failure to meet the unit price targets for two successive years and that it expects to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner would require the Partnership to purchase SAMLP's general partner interest (the "Redeemable General Partner Interest") at its then fair value, and to pay certain fees and other compensation as provided in the partnership agreement. SAMI, the managing general partner of SAMLP, has calculated the fair value of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be $36.2 million at December 31, 1995, before reduction for the principal balance ($4.2 million at December 31, 1995) and accrued interest ($4.4 million at December 31, 1995) on the note receivable from SAMLP for its original capital contribution to the Partnership.
In January 1995, NRLP, SAMLP, and the NRLP oversight committee and William H. Elliott executed an Implementation Agreement which provides for the nomination of an entity controlled by Mr. Elliott as successor

general partner and for the resolution of all related matters under the Moorman Settlement Agreement. On February 20, 1996, the parties to the Implementation Agreement executed an Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
Provided that the successor general partner is elected pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement, SAMLP shall receive $12,471,500 from the Partnership. This amount represents a compromise settlement of the net amounts owed by the Partnership to SAMLP upon SAMLP's withdrawal as General Partner and any amounts which SAMLP and its affiliates may owe to the Partnership. This amount shall be paid to SAMLP pursuant to a promissory note in accordance with the terms set forth in the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
The Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement has been submitted to the Judge supervising the implementation of the Moorman Settlement Agreement (the "Supervising Judge") for tentative approval and approval of the notice to be sent to the original class members. Upon final approval by the Supervising Judge, the proposal to elect the successor general partner will be submitted to NRLP's unitholders for a vote. In addition, the unitholders will vote upon amendments to the Partnership Agreement which relate to the proposed compensation of the successor general partner and other related matters.
Upon approval by NRLP's unitholders, SAMLP shall withdraw as General Partner and the successor general partner shall take office. If the required approvals are obtained, it is anticipated that the successor general partner will be elected and take office during the second or third quarter of 1996.
The Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement provides that SAMLP, and its affiliates owning units in the Partnership shall not vote to remove the successor general partner, except for removal with cause, for a period of 36 months from the date the successor general partner takes office.
Upon the election and taking office of the successor general partner, the class action settlement plan and the NRLP oversight committee shall terminate. If the successor general partner is not elected, the existing settlement shall remain in full force and effect and all of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement shall be voided, including the compromise settlement, referred to above, of amounts owed by SAMLP and the Partnership to each other.
On April 24, 1995, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Company's entering into a comfort and indemnification letter whereby the Company would agree to indemnify Mr. Elliott and any entity controlled by Mr. Elliott which is elected to serve as the successor general partner of NRLP and NOLP. Such indemnification will stand behind any indemnification to which Mr. Elliott or any entity controlled by Mr. Elliott may be entitled to under the NRLP partnership agreement.

The equity loss is primarily due to the writedown of a wraparound mortgage note receivable
