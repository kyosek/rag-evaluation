Risks of Ownership
Prior to the disposition of the Partnership's property the possibility existed that the tenants were unable to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the terms of their leases, including making base rent payments to the Partnership. Such a default by the tenants or a premature termination of any one of the leases could have had an adverse effect on the financial position of the Partnership. In addition, the Partnership may have been unable to successfully locate substitute tenants due to the fact that various buildings had been designed or built primarily to house a specific operation. Thus the Partnership properties may not have been readily marketable to a new tenant without substantial capital improvements or remodeling. Such improvements may have required expenditure of Partnership funds otherwise available for distribution.
