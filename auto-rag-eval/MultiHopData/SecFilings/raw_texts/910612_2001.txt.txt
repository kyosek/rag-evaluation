ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
Malls
Each of the Malls is an enclosed regional shopping complex. Each Mall generally has at least three Anchors which own or lease their stores and numerous non-anchor stores with GLA less than 30,000 square feet ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers, located along enclosed malls connecting the Anchors. At most of the Malls, additional freestanding restaurants and retail stores are located on the periphery of the Mall complex. For the purposes of calculating sales per square foot, non-Anchor stores over 10,000 square feet are excluded but are classified as mall stores for all other purposes. The freestanding stores are, in most cases, owned by their occupants. Fifteen of the Mall complexes include one or more Associated Centers.
The total GLA of the 52 Malls is approximately 41.5 million square feet or an average GLA of approximately 778,000 square feet per Mall. Mall Store GLA is 14.7 million square feet including leased free-standing buildings at December 31, 2001. The Company wholly owns all but ten of its Malls and manages all but two of them.
In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, Mall revenues represented approximately 76.9%, 77.3% and 84.7%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

Mall store sales per square foot decreased for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 2000.
Average base rent per square foot at December 31, 2001 and 2000 as follows:
Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for tenants in the Stabilized Malls (excluding malls acquired in 1999 from the 1999 calculation) were 11.5%, 11.9% and 11.3% for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.
The Malls are generally located in middle-markets. Management believes that the Malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only, or the dominant enclosed malls within their respective trade areas. Trade areas have been identified by management based upon a number of sources of information, including the location of other malls, publicly available population information, customer surveys, surveys of customer automobile license plates, as well as ZIP codes and third-party market studies.
The three largest revenue-producing Malls are Coolsprings Galleria, Hanes Mall and Hamilton Place Mall. Coolsprings Galleria is located on a 150-acre site in Nashville, Tennessee and represented, as of December 31, 2001, 2.1% of the Properties' total GLA, 2.3% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.6% of total revenues of the Company. Hanes Mall is located on a 112-acre site in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and represented, as of December 31, 2001, 2.9% of the Properties' total GLA, 3.4% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.9% of total revenues of the Company. Hamilton Place Mall is located in on a 187-acre site in Chattanooga, Tennessee and represented, as of December 31, 2001, 2.2% of the Properties' total GLA, 2.2% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.6% of total revenues of the Company.
Forty-three of the fifty-two Malls have undergone an expansion or renovation since their opening, and all but six of the existing Stabilized and New Malls have either been built, renovated or expanded in the last 10 years one of which, Parkway Place in Huntsville, Alabama has been demolished and is undergoing redevelopment. During 2001, the Company completed the renovation and first phase expansion of Meridian Mall in Lansing Michigan, completed a food court addition at Georgia Square Mall in Athens Georgia and completed an expansion of Springdale Mall in Mobile, Alabama. During 2001, the Company also renovated Burnsville Center in Minneapolis (Burnsville), Minnesota and two of the Newly Acquired Malls; Cary Towne Center in Cary, North Carolina and Fashion Square in Saginaw, Michigan. In 2002 the Company plans renovations for Columbia Mall in Columbia, South Carolina; Parkdale Mall in Beaumont, Texas; Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, Kentucky; St Clair Square in Fairview Heights, Illinois; Hickory Hollow Mall in Nashville, Tennessee; and Stroud Mall in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Four of the Malls have available Anchor pads providing expansion potential. Forty-eight existing Anchors at twenty-three Malls have aggregate expansion potential at their existing stores of approximately 1,532,000 buildable square feet subject in certain cases to maintaining approved parking ratios and / or approval of governmental agencies. New department stores opening in 2002 are as follows: Target at Citadel Mall, Charleston, South Carolina; Belk at College Square, Morristown, Tennessee; Dillard's at Randolph Mall, Asheboro, North Carolina, Foley's at Parkdale Mall in Beaumont, Texas and Dillard's at Asheville Mall, Asheville, North Carolina. All of these new department stores are replacing previous anchors or anchor vacancies.
The land underlying the Malls is owned in fee simple in all cases, except for Walnut Square, WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, Wausau Center and Eastgate Mall which are each subject to long-term ground leases for all or a portion of the land underlying these Malls.

The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 2001.
Anchors. Anchors are a critical factor in a Mall's success because the public's identification with a property typically focuses on its Anchors. Mall Anchors generally are department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the Malls derive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchor stores than from Mall Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in generating customer traffic and making the Malls desirable locations for Mall Store tenants.
Anchors either own their stores together with the land under them, sometimes with adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores at rental rates that are significantly lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores. Anchors account for approximately 6.4% of the total revenues from the Company's Properties. Each Anchor which owns its own store has entered into a reciprocal easement agreement with the Company covering, among other things, operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansions.
The Malls at December 31, 2001 have a total of 226 Anchors and one vacant Anchor storesat each of the following Malls: Asheville Mall, Citadel Mall, College Square Mall, Parkdale Mall and Randolph Mall. New department stores are scheduled to open in 2002 eliminating these vacant anchor stores. One new Anchor vacancy occurred after December 31, 2001 at Kentucky Oaks Mall. The following table indicates all Mall Anchors and sets forth the aggregate number of square feet owned or leased by Anchors in the Malls as of December 31, 2001.

Mall Anchor Summary Information As of December 31, 2001
Mall Stores. The Malls have approximately 7,706 Mall Stores. National or regional chains (excluding individually franchised stores) lease approximately 86.7% of the occupied Mall Store GLA. Although Mall Stores occupy only 29.6% of total Mall GLA, the Malls derived approximately 89.4% of their revenue from Mall Stores for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Among the companies with the largest representation among Mall Stores are: The Limited, Inc./Intimate Brands, Inc. stores (The Limited, Limited Too, Express, Lerner New York, Structure, Victoria's Secret, and Bath and Body Works); The Gap. Inc. (The Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap Kids ) and Footlocker, Inc. (Footlocker, Lady Footlocker, Kids Footlocker and Champs Sports Stores). As of December 31, 2001, The Limited, Inc.'s and Intimate Brands, Inc.'s 189 stores accounted for 6.9% of total mall leased GLA and 6.4% of the Company's total revenues. As of December 31, 2001, The Gap. Inc.'s 67 stores accounted for 5.0% of total mall leased GLA and 2.7% of the Company's total

Cost of Occupancy. Management believes that in order to maximize the Company's Funds from Operations, tenants in Mall Stores must be able to operate profitably. A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is the tenant's cost of occupancy.
The following table summarizes for Stabilized Mall and Newly Acquired Mall Store tenants the occupancy costs under their leases as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the last three years.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had investments in seven malls and two associated centers in joint ventures with third parties, all of which are reflected using the equity method of accounting. Condensed combined results of operations for the seven- unconsolidated affiliates are presented in the following table (in thousands).
Associated Centers
The eighteen Associated Centers are each part of a Mall complex and generally have one or two Anchor tenants and various smaller tenants. Anchor tenants in these centers include such retailers as Books-A-Million, Target, Toys "R" Us, TJ Maxx, and Goody's, which are category dominant retailers that benefit from the regional draw of the Malls. The Associated Centers also increase the draw to the total Mall complex.
Total leasable GLA of the eighteen Associated Centers is approximately 3.2 million square feet, including Anchors, or an average of approximately 178,000 square feet per center. As of December 31, 2001, 95.6% of total leasable GLA at the Associated Centers was occupied. During 2001 the Company completed the expansion of one Associated Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, revenues from the Associated Centers represented approximately 3.7%, 4.1 and 2.6%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, average tenant sales per square foot at the Associated Centers were approximately $184, $185 and $198, respectively.
Average base rent per square foot at the Associated Centers decreased from $9.88 at December 31, 2000 to $9.73 at December 31, 2001.

The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Associated Centers as of December 31, 2001.
Community and Power Centers
In addition to Mall development, the Company's development activities focus on Community Centers, and power centers. Community Centers pose fewer development risks than Malls because they have shorter development timetables and lower up-front costs. Community Centers also afford the Company the opportunity to meet the needs of retailers for whom a "convenience" type of location is more appropriate and the needs of customers whose trade areas cannot support a regional mall. Power centers are larger than other Community Centers, with several large anchor stores which draw shoppers from a wider geographic area.
The Company's Community Center developments in the 1980's were generally anchored by supermarkets, and, in certain cases, by drug stores. Management's current focus has expanded to include the development of larger centers, anchored by mass merchandisers and department stores, while continuing the development of smaller centers anchored by supermarkets and drug stores. During 2001, the Company opened the 404,000 Creekwood Crossing in Bradenton, Florida and completed expansions at Coastal Way in Springhill, Florida; Massard Crossing in Ft. Smith, Arkansas; Sutton Plaza in Mt. Olive, New Jersey; and Chesterfield Crossing in Richmond, Virginia. During 2001, the Company sold six Community Centers for total proceeds of $78.2 million. The proceeds were used primarily to retire debt. The Company also sold one Community Center in January 2001.
Community Centers, other than power centers, range in size from 25,000 square feet to in excess of 420,000 square feet. Anchors in Community Centers generally lease their store space and occupy 60-85% of a center's GLA. The number of stores in a Community Center ranges from one to seventeen with an average of nine stores per center.
The Company's two power centers, which were completed and opened in 1997 and 1998, average 786,000 square feet and have an average of nine major anchor stores and additional small shop space ranging from 38,000 square feet to 136,000 square feet. These power centers are included in the Community Center classification in this report.
Total GLA of the 68 Community Centers is approximately 8.5 million square feet, or an average of approximately 125,000 square feet per center. Excluding power centers the average is 105,000 square feet per center. As of December 31, 2001, 97.0% of total leasable GLA at the Community Centers was leased.
In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, revenues from the Community Centers represented approximately 17.8%, 17.5 and 11.7%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
Occupancy at the Community Centers decreased from 97.8% at December 31, 2000 to 97.0% at December 31, 2001.
Average base rent per square foot at the Community Centers increased from $8.85 at December 31, 2000, to $9.43 at December 31, 2001.
As of December 31, 2001, Food Lion, a major regional supermarket operator with headquarters in North Carolina served as an anchor tenant in 25 of the Company's Community Centers. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Food Lion accounted for approximately 1.1% of the revenues generated by the Company's Properties.
With the exception of Suburban Plaza, Lions Head Village, MarketPlace at Flower Mound and Willowbrook Plaza , which were acquired by the Company in March 1995, July 1998, March 2000 and February 2001, respectively, each of the Community Centers was developed by the Company.

Mortgages
The Company owns six Mortgages which were granted prior to the Offering and two granted since in connection with sales by CBL of properties which it had previously developed.
The Company holds fee mortgages on eight community centers, which mortgages had, as of December 31, 2001, an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $8.1 million. Such mortgages entitle the Company to receive substantially all of such properties' current cash flow in the form of periodic debt service payments. The encumbered properties all opened between 1981 and 1990 and have two Anchor vacancies.
In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, revenues from the Mortgages represented less than 0.5% of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

The Company during 2001 occupied 34,470 square feet or 70% of the total square footage of the Office Building. At year end the Company relocated its headquarters to a new Office Building, CBL Center, that the Company owns 92% of. CBL Center is a 128,000 square foot building, in which the Company now occupies 75,000 square feet. The Company has listed the former headquarters Office Building, One Park Place, for sale.

Mortgage Debt and Ratio to Total Market Capitalization
As of December 31, 2001, the Operating Partnership's proportionate share of indebtedness of all Properties (whether or not consolidated for financial statement reporting purposes, including the Construction Properties) was approximately $2.393 billion. The Company's total market capitalization (the aggregate market value of the Company's outstanding shares of Common and Preferred Stock, assuming the full exchange of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership for Common Stock, plus the $2.393 billion total debt of the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2001 was $4.04 billion. Accordingly, the Company's debt to total market capitalization ratio as of December 31, 2001 was 59.2%. The debt to total market capitalization ratio, which is based upon the Company's proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated indebtedness and market values of equity, differs from debt-to-book capitalization ratios, which are based upon consolidated indebtedness and book values.
