Production and Development Properties
Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
North America
Nevada, USA. We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.7 million ounces for 2010 with ore mined from eight open pit and six underground mines. At December 31, 2010, we reported 31.2 million ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 81% of those ounces in open pit mines and 19% in underground mines. We are pursuing several development opportunities in Nevada with significant reserve expansion potential.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 79% of Nevada’s gold production in 2010, compared with 77% in 2009, and 72% in 2008. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately 85% are refractory ores and 15% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores are processed at Carlin by either bio-oxidation/flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site.
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.
In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport, refine and market minerals.
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold production of 38,000 ounces in 2010, 39,000 ounces in 2009 and 45,000 ounces in 2008 were attributable to Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.
We have an ore sale agreement with Yukon-Nevada Gold Corporation (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process the Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 15,000 ounces in 2010, 700 ounces in 2009 and 8,000 ounces in 2008, pursuant to this agreement. During 2008, Yukon-Nevada discontinued operations; however, during the second half of 2009, they resumed operations on a limited basis.
Mexico. We have a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Hope Bay, Canada. We own 100% of the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. Hope Bay is an 80 kilometer district in the Canadian arctic and is one of the last known undeveloped greenstone belts in the world. The exploration success over the last few
years continues to confirm the district’s significant long-term potential. In 2010, we commenced an underground decline at the Doris North deposit and expect the Doris phase 1 project to provide access for test stoping and development drilling, progressing to a construction decision by the end of 2011.
South America
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. MYSRL may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable. MYSRL, along with other mining companies in Peru, agreed with the central government in December 2006 to contribute 3.75% of its net profits to fund social development projects for a period of five years.
Yanacocha, Peru. Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. Reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2010 we reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Conga, Peru. The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. Feasibility studies on our preferred development option were completed in late 2009 and we continue to progress into the development stage with an emphasis on project engineering and obtaining all required permits. In 2010, we selected and mobilized the project engineering procurement and construction contractor. In October 2010, the project’s Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by the Peruvian authorities. A construction decision is expected in the first half of 2011. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015. At December 31, 2010 we reported 6.1 million ounces of gold reserves and 1,660 million pounds of copper reserves at Conga.
La Zanja, Peru. Newmont holds a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold project near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interests are held by Buenaventura. The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. The site will consist of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 21,000 attributable gold ounces in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Asia Pacific
Australia/New Zealand. In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights.
Boddington. Boddington (100% owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Kalgoorlie. Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2010 we reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves.
Jundee. Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from underground sources in 2010, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 335,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 0.8 million ounces of gold reserves.
Tanami. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold and at December 31, 2010 we reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Waihi. Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and currently consists of the Favona underground deposit and the Martha open pit. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves.
Duketon. We have a 16.22% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), a mineral company with significant gold and nickel exploration properties in Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Regis owns 100% of the Duketon gold project, which is located approximately 200 miles northeast of Kalgoorlie. Duketon commenced production in the third quarter of 2010 and produced 5,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. At December 31, 2010, we reported 0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2010 we reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.
We own 31.50% of the Batu Hijau mine through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. Newmont entered into transactions with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”) and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), unrelated noncontrolling partners of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds in exchange for a pledge of the shares as security, an assignment of the noncontrolling partners’ combined 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and certain voting rights and obligations to the Company. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) as they have minimal attributable capital and certain voting rights and obligations to their 20% interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% to 48.50% at December 31, 2010. The remaining 24% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”). We are currently the operator of Batu Hijau.
In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
Under the Contract of Work 51% of PTNNT’s shares must have been offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. Pursuant to this provision, the ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the future to as low as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. Furthermore, as part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTP owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we will likely lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by NTP. Such loss of control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce
our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Africa
Ahafo, Ghana. Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009, the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal Stabilization levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are pending, we have paid and included $14 in Income and mining tax expense to date under the levy.
Akyem, Ghana. Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, we received the mining lease for Akyem. We continue to progress into the development stage with an emphasis on project engineering and obtaining all required land access and permits. In 2010, we selected and mobilized the project engineering procurement and construction contractor and we are advancing the project towards a construction decision in the first half of 2011. If all permits are secured, we expect this project to commence production in late 2013 or early 2014. At December 31, 2010, we reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.

Proven and Probable Reserves
We had proven and probable gold reserves of 93.5 million ounces at December 31, 2010, calculated at a gold price assumption of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce, respectively. Our 2010 reserves would decline by approximately 5% (4.9 million ounces), if calculated at a $900 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to $1,000 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 3% (3.1 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2009, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce, respectively.
At December 31, 2010, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 33.5 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end proven and probable gold reserves were 60.0 million ounces, including 31.4 million ounces in Asia Pacific, 17.2 million ounces in Africa and 11.4 million ounces in South America.
Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2010 were 9,420 million pounds. For 2010, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $2.50 or A$2.95 per pound, increased from $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound, used in 2009.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the several different processing methods that we use. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold
and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2011, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2011.
The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009:
(1)
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary
for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proven and probable reserves include gold or copper attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold or copper extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2010 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2009 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
