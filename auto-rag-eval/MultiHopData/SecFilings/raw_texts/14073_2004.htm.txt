The borrower has an option to extend the maturity date a further 12 months. We invested $4,194,000 for our 80% interest in the joint venture.
Waterfront Complex-Beginning in 1964, we developed, on a portion of the southwest Washington, D.C. Urban Renewal Area, a shopping-office center ("Complex") containing approximately 1,144,000 square feet of office, retail and storage space, consisting of two high-rise office buildings ("Office Buildings") containing approximately 326,000 square feet, an enclosed center ("Center") consisting of approximately 740,000 square feet, most of which is office space and the balance consisting of retail space, approximately 1,100 parking spaces and approximately 78,000 square feet of storage space. These improvements were constructed on ground leased from The District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency ("RLA") for a term expiring in 2058 with an option to extend for an additional 20 years.
We assigned our interests in the Complex to a joint venture entity, B&R Waterfront Properties, LLC ("BRW"). We are the managing member and hold a 54% interest in BRW. A partnership in which Co-Chairmen of the company are among the partners holds a portion of the remaining 46% interest.
Prior to September 2002, the United States General Services Administration ("GSA") leased all of the space in the two Office Buildings, as well as the second and third floors of the adjacent Center and a portion of another smaller structure, totaling approximately 955,000 square feet, or 89.6% of the total office and retail space in the complex, under a thirty year lease agreement. In September 2002 the GSA lease expired and was not subsequently renewed.
In October 2002, BRW formed a joint venture, called Waterfront Associates LLC ("WALLC"), with K/FCE Investment LLC ("K/FCE"), a joint venture between the Washington DC based developer, The Kaempfer Company, Inc., and the national developer, Forest City Enterprises, Inc., to redevelop and reposition the Complex. BRW contributed the leasehold improvements relating to the Complex to WALLC. Affiliates of K/FCE are marketing, leasing, redeveloping, and managing the complex. K/FCE has the right, subject to certain conditions, to increase its ownership in the joint venture up to 50% by the making of capital contributions or by causing the joint venture to make capital distributions. To the extent required, K/FCE has committed to contribute the first $25,000,000 of redevelopment funds. If necessary, BRW may be required to contribute a portion of the additional equity required in excess of the $25,000,000. K/FCE, as the managing member of WALLC, has sole responsibility for the management, control, and operation of the LLC, as well as for the formulation and execution of its business and investment policy.
While WALLC still operates the retail space, the expiration of the GSA lease adversely affected the retail tenants in the Complex who relied heavily on business generated by the employees who occupied the GSA space and several have since vacated their premises. BRW is obligated to pay the costs associated with tenant relocation expenses for the remaining tenants in connection with the redevelopment of the Complex. The majority of these tenants had received their negotiated relocation costs, which are considered part of the redevelopment, by December 31, 2004. A further tenant received their payment in January, 2005. We cannot determine at this time the amount or timing of the relocation expenses for those tenants who have not yet received a payment.
As part of the redevelopment of the Waterfront Complex, BRW may incur significant costs relating to the remediation of hazardous materials. A reserve has been established for this purpose in the amount of $3,000,000, of which $1,620,000 was contributed by us and the balance was contributed by the minority partners of BRW.
WALLC is currently active in the preliminary planning and development stages as it continues to seek tenants. Through December 31, 2004, approximately $10,000,000 of planning and development costs had been incurred by the joint venture, and was funded by capital contributions from K/FCE.
