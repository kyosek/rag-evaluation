San Sebastian Gold Mine ("SSGM")
Tailings from the SSGM were, and now virgin gold ore is being transported to the SCMP site to produce gold. SCMP is gradually being expanded and improved technically to increase its virgin ore tonnage process to a capacity of 300 to 400 tons per day. It is mining virgin gold ore from its open pit and it plans to extract the stope fill from underground to produce gold on the SSGM site. The property consists of 1,470 acres. SSGM is located approximately two and one-half miles northwest of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union, Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
SSGM Current Status
The Company, through its Joint Venture is conducting the following activities: It is in the development and pre-production mining stage which consists of completing its survey, mapping, site preparation, infrastructure, construction, planning, and in the performance of the auxiliary work needed to begin gold production at the SSGM site. The Joint Venture's geologists have determined that SSGM has minable gold ore reserves via an open pit of approximately 13.4 million tons of gold ore which should contain approximately 1.166 million ounces of gold. In addition, it has approximately 960,000 tons of dump material, and about one million tons of stope fill. Presently, the Company is seeking funding to purchase equipment, to purchase inventory, and to use for working capital for its on-site proposed open-pit, heap-leaching operation. In addition, the Company is actively engaged in the exploration and development of the peripheral area (including diamond core drilling) surrounding the main body of gold ore in order to increase its gold ore reserves.
The Company's main objective and plan, through the Joint Venture, is to operate a moderate tonnage, low-grade, open-pit, heap-leaching operation to produce gold on its SSGM site. Dependent on the funding, the grade of ore, and the tonnage processed, it anticipates producing more than 40,000 ounces of gold from its open-pit, heap-leaching operations during the first twelve full operating months and more thereafter.
In 1997, a diamond drilling program with an independent contractor was initiated at the SSGM mine area to substantiate and expand the gold reserves. At the same time, pit walls were excavated and the old vein system was exposed to facilitate systematic sampling of the wallrock. This program demonstrated that true widths of up to 100 feet of altered and mineralized trachyte occur frequently in the open-pit and adjacent areas. Panel and surface channel sampling of these exposures revealed assays in the 0.03 to 0.20 ounce per ton gold range. In addition, under ground workings on the Limon, Guaramal, Santa Elena, and Taladron veins are being rehabilitated.
SSGM Geology
The ore deposit consists of contact-fissure veins carrying gold-bearing pyrite. The veins occur at the contact between quartz-monzonite porphyry dike and surrounding eruptives which are basalt capped by trachyte. All the rocks are of recent age, probably late tertiary. The SSGM lies within a silicified and hydrothermally altered zone of acid to basic volcanoes roughly within a two-square kilometer area.
The occurrence is typical of the late stage deposition associated with instrusives in Island Arc plate tectonics dating millions of years (four to 65 million) ago. These are typically polymetallic precious metal-base deposits with high grade veining in large haloes of low grade resembling in part the Kuroko deposits in Japan. The dike is shaped like a flattened "s" and consists of a 2,800 foot long essentially vertical east-west segment, a northwest striking western section "dragged" sharply north for 800 feet and dipping 70 degrees northeast and a vertical south-east striking east.
The geology of the SSGM deposit is integrally linked to the presence of a quartz monzonite intrusive. This quartz monzonite has the appearance of being a high level sill and is probably coeval with the surrounding tertiary aged trachytes that form the main SSGM ridge. The geometric configuration of the quartz monzonite controls the localization of quartz veins and alteration of the trachytes. The overall structural control is east-west; according to historic mine records, the monzonite contacts with depth, but successive level plans suggest a funnel shaped structure plunging to the southeast. On a detailed scale, the quartz veins are controlled by a master set of parallel veins preferentially oriented east-west. The vein branch generally dips north and is interconnected by southeast dipping diagonal veins of variable strike. Mapping records describe veins as sinuous, further suggesting brittle stress regimens, with veins occupying dilational zones. These fissure style veins are up to five feet in width, and generally occur in trachyte or at the contact between trachyte and monzonite.
Pre and post mineral faulting is common throughout the deposit. The deposit is said to diminish when a basalt "basement" contact is approached at a depth, however basalt on top of San Juan Hill is also recognized. The funnel shape of the deposit, suggests however a potential synvolcanic structural control, with a source to the southeast. The San Juan area has not been tested by modern exploration techniques.
Based on data available at present, the hydrothermal system focused on SSGM has a dimension of approximately 3,500 feet in strike, a vertical extension of 1,100 feet (minimum) and an approximate width of 500 feet. The volume of hydrothermally altered rocks in the system prior to erosion is likely to have been in the magnitude of up to 200 million tons.
Gold occurs in the native form and also occurs rarely as a telluride. Pyrite is the predominant sulphide mineral in the deposit and it is the most common host to the fine grained gold. Copper minerals including bormite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite, enargite and luzonite have been identified. Gold mineralization is accompanied by silicification; other gangue minerals include kaolimite and sericite and more rarely barite. High grade gold streaks are associated with barite.
The SSGM deposit represents a bonanza gold system formed within a coeval high level alkaline intrusive-extrusive complex. Mineralization is more consistent with an acid sulphate system generated within an intracratonic caldera setting. The potential for SSGM to host millions of ounces of gold is considered to be excellent.
SSGM Ore Reserves
As of March 31, 1997, the SSGM has approximately 13.4 million tons of virgin proven gold ore reserves, grading 0.087 ounces of gold per ton and containing about 1.2 million ounces of gold. Overall the stripping ratio is low, ranging from zero in the Coseguina Hill area which is highly mineralized and consists of a series of high angle vertical veins to a possible stripping ratio of 1:3 to 1:8. It is planned to use these reserves; they will be screened, crushed and, if required, they will be agglomerated and placed on a proposed leach pad on the SSGM site. About one million tons of stope fill with a grade of 0.34 ounces per ton and approximately 960,000 tons of dump material with an average grade of 0.10 ounces of gold per ton. (For additional information, reference is made to "Item 1. Proposed Mining, Mill, Heap-Leaching and Exploration Operations.")
Since July 1987 through March 31, 1997, the following exploration has been performed on the SSGM site: surface channel trenching, 34,594 meters (114,160 feet/21.6 miles); test pit hole excavations, 655 vertical meters (2,162 feet/.41 miles); underground workings and adit openings, 1,054 meters (3,478 feet/.66 miles). The surface samples from the trenching averaged 0.026 ounces of gold per ton over an area approximately 1,000 feet in width and approximately 5,000 feet in length. A total of 46,619 SSGM gold ore samples were fire assayed at the Joint Venture laboratory.
SSGM Diamond Drilling Program
The Joint Venture has completed eight diamond drill holes at the SSGM site. Five were on the San Juan Hill which ranged in depth from 106 feet to 172 feet and the grade varied (dependent on the rock encountered) from 0.01 to 0.15 ounces of gold per ton. Three drill holes were drilled in the Coseguina area from 62 feet to 255 feet. The grade of gold from 402 fire assay samples varied from 0.01 to 0.54 ounces of gold per ton. In some areas former adits were encountered which prevented the drilling to go to a deeper depth.
SSGM Proposed Mining Open-Pit, Heap-Leaching Operations at the SSGM Site
The open-pit ore will be loaded into trucks by wheel loaders and hauled to the recovery plant area. The ore will then be placed into a vibrating screen hopper which will remove gold ore larger than 3/4 inches in size. Lime, cement and cyanide solution will be added if needed to this crushed ore. If needed, it will then be placed into an agglomerator to convert the fine material into small stable pellets saturated with cyanide solution. The material will be conveyed to the leach pad and stacked using conveyors.
The first step will be to load the first sections of the pad with the crushed ore. Belt conveyors will be used to transfer ore to a stacking conveyor to build a heap. After loading is completed, the ore cures and the top surface of the heap will be manually levelled. Leaching of the heap proceeds by distributing barren sodium cyanide leach solution to the heap with sprinklers or by drip irrigation.
The gold will be recovered via a carbon column system where the porous carbon recovers the solvent gold by adsorption. The carbon will be stripped and the solution will flow through an electrowinning cell where gold will be recovered from the strip solution by electroplating onto stainless steel wool cathodes.
Gold laden steel wool cathodes will be periodically removed from the electrowinning cells and transferred to the replating cell. In the replating cell the gold will be electrolytically stripped from the steel wool and plated onto stainless steel cathode sheets.
The gold will be recovered from the cathodes, mixed with fluxes, placed in a crucible, and heated in a furnace until melted. The gold will then be poured into molds to form dore bars.
SSGM Ownership of the Property
The San Sebastian Gold Mine real estate consisting of approximately 1,470 acres, is owned by Misanse, a Salvadoran Corporation. The Company owns 52% of Misanse common shares that are issued and outstanding.
History and Development-SSGM
The San Sebastian Gold Mine has a long history of gold production. Unquestionably, the SSGM deposit was the jewel of the El Salvador mining industry and one of the most prolific gold mines in Central America.
Prior to 1880, the SSGM was probably known to the natives of the area and Spaniards, and may have produced gold during colonial days; however, no records of production exist. Numerous artifacts in the Santa Rosa River below the present day SSGM provide mute evidence of primitive early day mining operations.
In 1883, an American company hired Mr. Charles Butters to conduct experimental metallurgical tests on ore from the SSGM in his laboratory in New York. He determined that amalgamation and gravity concentration could not be effectively employed, but that the gold was amenable to recovery by chlorination.
From 1885-1888, the first effective exploration work at the SSGM was done by the above-mentioned American company. Mr. Butters was contracted to build a 30-ton-per-day chlorination plant at the SSGM site. This small scale operation proved unsuccessful, and the SSGM ceased production.
In 1898, the property was purchased by General Lisandro Letona.
In 1904, Mr. Butters, believing that the SSGM was a valuable property which had been grossly mismanaged, acquired the property in association with Mr. David J. Pullinger of Johannesburg, South Africa, for $100,000. Within a year of acquisition, Mr. Butters had established ore reserves of 42,560 tons with an average content of 2.75 ounces per ton. Their operations mined approximately $1,000,000 worth of gold from ore bearing gold at two and three quarter ounces or more per ton.
From 1904 to 1908, three investigations were made at the SSGM site by Mr. Butters and his staff regarding the type of beneficiation process best suited to the SSGM ores. It was determined that roasting, followed by cyanidation, and the recovery of the gold by means of combined electrolytic and zinc precipitation, was the most effective method. In later years, roasting of the ores was discontinued.
(During the period 1890-1898, Mr. Butters had been active in the development of cyanidation of gold ores at the Rand Mine in South Africa, and recognized the process as a revolutionary metallurgical practice.)
Continuous operations at the SSGM by Butters Salvador Mines were performed from 1908 to 1917, at which time operations ceased due to exhaustion of what they believed to be all of the high grade (two ounces or more of gold per ton) ore body. Butters Salvador Mines was voluntarily liquidated in October 1917.
Initially, mill capacity was 20 tons per day; it later increased to 40 tons, then to 100 tons, and finally, 120 tons per day. For a period of several years, mill heads averaged no less than two ounces of gold per ton. The SSGM was considered among the richest gold mines in the world. During the peak years of operation (1908-1917), more than 1,500 people were employed at the SSGM. During this interval of time, the SSGM is reported to have produced 950,000 ounces of gold.
From 1917 to 1921, small operations at the SSGM, under the direction of Mr. Butters, yielded approximately 150,000 ounces of gold.
In 1924, Mr. G. Swanquist, a former member of Mr. Butters' staff, obtained the rights to develop the SSGM, but did no work worthy of mention.
From 1933 to 1953, owing to the increase in the world price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35.00 per ounce, operations were renewed under the name of Butters Salvador Mines, Ltd. Initially, only the richest ore shoots were mined; later, level and shaft pillars were exploited. In 1933, the rate of milling was approximately 40 tons per day. Diminishing grade and labor problems forced closure in 1953. During the period 1933 to 1945, approximately 150,000 ounces of gold were produced, and from 1945 to 1953, 30,000 ounces of gold were produced.
In 1953, when Butters Salvador Mines, Ltd. ceased operations, members of the labor union acquired the property in lieu of a severance pay settlement. The members of the union organized Misanse, an El Salvador Corporation, and managed monthly shipments of approximately 70 tons of surface oxide ore and old fill to the nearby Mina Lola mill.
In 1964, a ten-ton-per-day flotation and cyanide plant operated intermittently on an unprofitable basis.
From 1967 to 1968, there were unprofitable small-scale high-grading operations on an intermittent basis by various local miners working under a contract system with Misanse.
The Company's investment in Sanseb dates back to 1969. Sanseb acquired its lease to mine gold from Misanse in 1968. During March of 1973, the Company acquired control of Sanseb, and since then, owns 2,002,037 (82 1/2%) of Sanseb's issued and outstanding common shares.
From 1969 to 1972, work advanced in reopening collapsed SSGM adits, tunnels and workings, with limited mining-milling operations. A straight cyanidation plant was installed using zinc box (shavings) precipitation and operating on an intermittent basis with limited daily production.
From February of 1973 to 1978, reorganization of Sanseb under the control of the Company, with continuous and increased production from the SSGM, was commenced along with extensive plant modifications, including conversion to Merrill Crowe type (zinc dust) precipitation. The existing mill was upgraded to 100 tons per day when this plant was installed. The underground tunnels and workings were rehabilitated. While the SSGM produced significant revenue, heavy exploration and development costs strained the cash flow of the operation.
On February 6, 1978, Sanseb ordered operations at the SSGM suspended due to the unavailability of investment capital and the lack of continuity in management, primarily due to the political unrest, particularly in the Eastern Zone of El Salvador where the SSGM is located. On May 6, 1978, as a result of the decision to suspend operations, former employees of Sanseb claimed that Sanseb was obligated under El Salvador law for the payment of severance pay to its former employees. Sanseb's legal position was that it temporarily suspended operations due to the political instability and since it did not terminate all activities, it was not liable at that time for the severance pay. In January of 1979, a lower El Salvador Court awarded possession of the mining rights (not the real estate) to the former employees. It is believed that the Court had no right to award a concession as only the Government of El Salvador has this right and authority.
During 1979, when the embargo was in effect, Mr. Robert Villatoro contracted to operate the SSGM. From the reports provided by his employees, it is believed that he extracted more than 10,000 ounces of gold. Mr. Villatoro ceased operations during 1981 or 1982 when the guerrillas were extremely active in the eastern part of El Salvador which includes the SSGM area.
During this time a dramatic increase in the world market price of gold (a peak of over $800/oz. in 1980) as well as developments in the technology of gold extraction presented new opportunities for the Company and Sanseb at the SSGM.
In February 1985, the Company made an on-site inspection of the mill and SSGM site, which disclosed that the buildings, offices, machine shop, laboratory, mill and equipment were completely destroyed. Also, the SSGM tunnels and workings consisting of approximately 37 miles were demolished and collapsed. The Company consulted with geologists and engineers to develop a new plan of extracting gold from the reserves developed in the Company's exploration and development program and to process gold via an open-pit, heap-leaching operation.
In June 1985, the Company and Sanseb settled the claims of Sanseb's former employees by agreeing to compensate them for the severance pay with proceeds attained from future gold production. The El Salvador Court, on June 6, 1985, had decreed, in a non-appealable order, to the nullification of all previous acts of the previous Court's orders, and removed the embargo previously decreed. In addition, the El Salvador Court ordered the return of all of the assets, rights and everything else whatsoever previously owned by the Company, Misanse and Sanseb.
The Company had no significant activity at the SSGM site from February 1978 through January 1987. The present status is that, since January 1987, the Company, through the Joint Venture, has completed certain of the required mining pre-production preliminary stages in the minable proven gold ore reserve area, and it is active in attempting to obtain financing for the project. It is also engaged in the exploration and the expansion program to develop additional gold ore reserves in the area surrounding the minable gold ore reserves.
On July 27, 1987, El Salvador President Jose Napoleon Duarte, at an official ceremony in the City of Santa Rosa de Lima, personally presented the mining concession to Misanse, which simultaneously was assigned to Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc.
In September 1987 the Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture was formed to conduct and manage the El Salvadoran business operations.
During October 1989, the Joint Venture set up in the City of San Miguel, its own laboratory equipment and began performance of assays from its SSGM ore sample. It trained its personnel to use this modern laboratory which was equipped with modern technical equipment.
Since 1990 to present date, extensive surface channel trenching, adit openings and test pit excavations developed thousands of fire assay samples. They were assayed at the Joint Venture laboratory. This laboratory was relocated to a Company-owned site near the SSGM. Extensive dirt roads and a bridge were constructed. Electric lines to the laboratory were restored. A diamond drilling program has been initiated to determine if there are additional gold ore reserves on this site.
During this twelve-month period ended March 31, 1997, the Company has advanced funds, performed services, and allocated its general and administrative costs to the Joint Venture.
San Cristobal Mill and Plant ("SCMP") Recovery and Processing System
SCMP Location
SCMP is located near the City of El Divisadero (off of the Pan American Highway), and is approximately 13 miles east of the City of San Miguel, the second largest City in the Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
SCMP Lease Agreement
On November 12, 1993, the Joint Venture entered into an agreement with Corporacion Salvadorena de Inversiones ("Corsain"), a governmental agency of El Salvador, to lease for a period of ten years, approximately 166 acres of land and buildings on which its gold processing mill, plant and related equipment are located, and which is approximately 15 miles east of the SSGM site. The annual lease payment is U.S. $11,500 (payable in El Salvador colones at the then current rate of exchange), payable annually in advance, and subject to an annual increase based on the annual United States' inflation rate. As agreed, a security deposit of U.S. $11,500 was paid on the same date which also will be increased annually to correspond with the annual U.S. inflation rate.
SCMP Mill and Plant Process Description
On February 23, 1993, at a foreclosure auction held by an El Salvador Court, the Company, on behalf of the Joint Venture, was the successful bidder in acquiring SCMP, a precious metals' cyanide leaching mill and plant rated with a capacity of processing 200 tons of virgin ore per day consisting of the following unit operations: crushing, grinding, thickening, agitated leaching, counter current decantation of leach solution, recovery of precious metals by zinc precipitation (Merrill-Crowe), and direct smelting of precipitates to produce precious metals as dore and tailings' disposal.
Instead of utilizing the existing recovery system, the Joint Venture's engineers have designed a carbon-in-leach (CIL) process which is described in detail under Project Operating Plan.
The Joint Venture completed a certain stage of the retrofitting, rehabilitation, repairing and restoring of the SCMP's plant and it continues to perform such plant and equipment alterations, modifications and improvements to expand the SCMP's capacity to process 300/400 tons of virgin ore per day. It presently is producing gold on a limited production basis by processing the virgin ore from its SSGM.
SCMP Gold Ore Sources
The Joint Venture has several sources of gold ore to process at the SCMP: the 185,000 tons of Potosi tailings which have an average grade of 0.06 ounces of gold per ton; the SSGM open-pit virgin ore; the dump material; and the ore and stope fill from the underground workings.
The other sources of gold ore to be used at the SCMP operations are the higher grade gold ore (0.13 ounces or higher) which could be processed with an up to 92% recovery grade or better at a rate of 300/400 tons per day. The income from the higher recovery of gold ore will be substantially more than the greater cost involved in this process. There is a sufficient amount of dump material, stope fill and higher grade virgin gold ore that could be used via the SCMP crushing and grinding process to recover up to 92% or more of the gold which recovery is substantially more than the expected 60% recovery of gold through the heap-leaching process. The Joint Venture's geologists estimate that there are more than one million tons of higher grade ore from the stope fill (underground) to be processed via the SCMP.
Current Status
The start-up, testing and adjustment stage of processing the remaining SSGM tailings via trucking this ore to the SCMP has commenced and the Joint Venture is in this preliminary stage of producing gold. The SCMP is designed to process 400 tons per day by utilizing 12-hour cycles that should recover approximately 70% of the gold from the tailings. The average grade was about 0.08 ounces of gold per ton.
During this fiscal year the Joint Venture did process at the SCMP approximately 75,000 dry tons (approximately 101,000 wet tons) of tailings which yielded 4,332 ounces of dore and accounted for 2,595 ounces of gold and 594 ounces of silver. The gross receipts amounted to $969,721. The proceeds from the sale of gold and silver were used to reduce the amount of Company advances to the Joint Venture.
San Felipe-El Potosi Mine ("Potosi") and its extension the El Capulin Mine ("El Capulin")
Potosi Location
The Joint Venture has commenced an exploration program on the Potosi property which is located approximately 18 miles northwest of the City of San Miguel, the second largest city in the Republic of El Salvador, on a paved road 15 miles to the City of Chapalteque and then west three miles on a gravel road to the City of Potosi. The historical records indicate that the potential of developing a gold mine is above average.
Potosi Historical Information
Historical records evidence that exploration and production of gold took place in 1899 and that Potosi was worked intermittently from 1906 through 1952. The main production period in six levels was from 1938 through 1952 at a rate of 35 to 50 tons per day. Production data avouch that 30,000 ounces of gold were produced from 1945 through 1952 after which the mine became dormant. During this time a limited underground exploration program confirmed that the gold ore reserves were of commercial value. The gold assays from some of the former drill hole samples on the southern extension of the north-south portion of this property showed a grade of 0.10 to 0.35 ounces of gold per ton of ore.
Potosi Geology
The Potosi vein type occurrences are very strong, persistent, poor quartz-calcite fissure fillings from two to ten feet wide and up to 3,400 feet in length. On a regional scale, the veins are fairly straight-forward type structures but in detail they can be complicated. Dips in the north-south veins are steeper than in the lattice systems such as the 50 degrees to 90 degrees in the Potosi type. The proportion of gold-to-silver increases in north-south striking veins or in veins of any orientation whose dips more closely approach the vertical.
Two relatively narrow north-south veins, 450 feet apart, have been worked in the past by vertical and an inclined shaft for up to 2,100 feet along the strike and to depths of between 180 and 440 feet below surface on four to six levels. The veins are contained in coarse-grained augite andesites. The larger of the veins is up to ten feet in width, dipping 55 degrees to 75 degrees west. The second vein is weaker in structure and about three feet in width. Gold values seem to be indiscriminately associated with quartz and do not seem to diminish at depth. Assay plans and ore reserve sections completed in 1952 show 30 blocks with an average grade of 0.6563 ounces of gold per ton. Holes drilled from the projected extension of the north-south portion of one of the veins returned various five-foot sludge samples grading 0.10 to 0.35 ounces of gold per ton with a one foot of core length grading at 0.39 ounces of gold per ton. It appears that the deposition took place at higher temperatures than attributed to silver, thus the vertical zoning of gold deposition is deeper or has a larger vertical dimension than silver; therefore the possibility of considerable ore below levels is a realistic one. The age mineralization is past laramide with the host rock being rhyolite. The previous gold-silver ratio was 0.3:1.
Potosi Tailings' Reserve
Since October 25, 1993, Comseb has had a full-time crew, ranging from 25 to 30 employees, conducting an exploration program consisting of surveys, channel trenching, adit openings, test pit holes, excavation and drilling of the tailings to determine its gold content.
Twenty-four test pit hole excavations have been plotted and drilled on this four-acre site of tailings. The depth to the bottom of the tailings' pile varied from 7.00 to 10.2 meters (23 to 34 vertical feet) and a total of 137.6 meters (454 feet) of test pit hole excavations were completed. The 573 fire assay samples (tailings) indicated an average grade of gold per ounce to be 0.06 (0.06 times 185,000 tons should contain 11,100 ounces of gold times a 70% recovery should yield about 7,770 ounces of gold).
Potosi and El Capulin Exploration Undertakings
A total of 2,100 meters (6,930 feet) of channel trenching was excavated with a grade ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 per ton. A total of 686 meters (2,264 feet) of adits has been restored for entry into the old workings. A tabulation of the work completed by the Joint Venture is as follows:
1. Surface
a. An exploration consisting of twenty-seven surface channel trenches were excavated consisting of 1,010 meters (3,333 feet). A total of 1,232 samples were fire assayed reflecting an average grade of gold of 0.02 ounces per ton. Two veins were intercepted which assays averaged 0.051 ounces of gold per ton. One vein encountered was 3.50 meters (11.55 feet) in width, while the other was 0.70 meters (2.31 feet) in width.
2. Potosi Underground Workings
a. Guayabito Adit: This adit was opened for a distance of 132.9 meters (439 feet) and a cross cut was encountered at 25 meters (83 feet) running to the west at which point a 0.40 meter (1.32 feet) thick vein was intercepted. The 399 samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.012 ounces per ton.
b. Guarumo Adit: At a point south 15 degrees east a 1.70 meter (5.61 feet) thick vein dips 60 degrees to the west. This adit is all vein area. A total of seven meters (23 feet) was cleaned and the three fire assay samples proved an average of 0.05 ounces of gold per ton.
c. San Isidro Adit: A total of 158 meters (521 feet) was cleaned and from the entrance a sub level 25 meters (83 feet) was developed on a vein running south 13 degrees east. This sub level is located 5.65 meters (19 feet) below the entry level. The vein is 2.80 meters (nine feet) thick from which more than 243 samples reflected an average grade of gold of 0.022 ounces per ton.
d. Cacho de Oro Adit: A total of 57 meters (188 feet) was cleaned in this adit. At a point 34 meters (112 feet), a crosscut was encountered which was advanced 23 meters (76 feet). A total of 59 fire assay samples reflected an average grade of 0.07 ounces of gold per ton.
e. Canon 821: Exploration progress continues at Canon 821 Adit, Winze 821, the General Winze and Adit 2A. Pillars were found in Adit 2A about 105 meters (347 feet) from the entry.
3. The El Capulin Mine
a. A total of more than 29 surface trenches was excavated over a distance of 537 meters (1,772 feet) and the 404 fire assay samples revealed an average grade of 0.10 ounces of gold per ton. A backlog of samples are in the process of being assayed.
b. In the Capulin adit, a total of 188 meters (620 feet) was cleaned; the goal is to reach the Capulin vein. The seven fire assay samples averaged a grade of 0.25 ounces of gold per ton.
4. Tailings
The 573 samples that were fire assayed reflected a grade of gold of 0.06 ounces per ton.
Exploration on this property will continue with channel trenching, re-opening of former adits, and to include diamond core and/or reverse circulation drilling, mapping and sampling of the known mineralized areas to determine if there is any commercial gold mineralization on this property. Diamond drilling may be utilized to outline the more promising shoots and to check for continuity of gold.

The exploration concession application was filed on September 6, 1993, with the Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons, a division of the El Salvador's Minister of Economy's office, by the owners of the real estate, the Cooperative San Felipe-El Potosi. An application for an exploration concession was filed on May 8, 1997 in order to comply with the current mining regulations adopted by the Government of El Salvador in February 1996. The concession consists of approximately 6,100 acres.
While the concession application is pending, it precludes any others from performing exploration on this site. Upon assessing that the property has potential mining prospects, the Joint Venture has the right to apply for the mining concession.
Potosi Lease Agreement
The Joint Venture entered into a lease agreement with the San Felipe Potosi Cooperative ("Cooperative") of the City of Potosi, El Salvador on July 6, 1993, to lease the real estate for a period of 30 years and with an option to renew the lease for an additional 25 years, for the purpose of mining and extracting minerals and under the following basic terms and conditions:
1. The term of the lease will be for a period of 30 years plus an option to automatically extend the lease for an additional 25 years.
2. The lease payment will be five percent of the gross receipts derived from the production of precious metals from this site and will be payable monthly.
3. The Joint Venture will advance to the Cooperative the funds required to obtain the mining concession from the El Salvador Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons and all related costs will be reimbursed or will become a deduction from future rental payments.
4. The Joint Venture will, when it is in production, employ all of the 45 qualified members of the Cooperative, providing that there is a need for their particular skill or service.
5. The Joint Venture will furnish medicine and first aid medical assistance to all of its employees to the extent that such benefits are not provided by the El Salvador Social Security System.
6. An employee life insurance program is to be seriously considered by the Joint Venture when production commences, providing that the cost of such insurance is not excessive.
Modesto Mine
Modesto Mine Location
The Modesto Mine is located due north of the town of El Paisnal, approximately 19 miles north of the Capital City, San Salvador. The Joint Venture considers this property as a good gold mining prospect and since August 1993, it has proceeded with an exploration program.
Modesto Mine Geology and History
From its geologist and from the records available to the Joint Venture, the following information was obtained:
Two persistent veins "Paredon" and "Chicharron" outcrop along the crests of two parallel hogback ridges 1,900 meters apart, and are composed of thick flat-lying andesite flows capped by discontinuous patches of rhyolite. These were examined in 1948-1950 by M. Buell along strike (45 degrees) for 2,240 meters and 2,760 meters respectively and down dip (60 degrees to 80 degrees southeast) a maximum of 25 meters. The Paredon vein was barren but the north-eastern 1,320 meters of the Chicharron returned the following values:
1. "D" winze, five meters deep, northeast end: 0.46 ounces of silver, 0.82 ounces of gold over 61 meters horizontally; 0.71 ounces of silver, 0.61 ounces of gold over 3.1 meters vertically from quartz of undetermined orientation in rhyolite; 0.30 ounces of silver, 1.20 ounces of gold from a 15-ton dump and a value of $14.653 per ton from a ten-ton dump. (The market price of gold was pegged at $35 an ounce.)
2. "S" winze, 420 meters southwest of "D" winze: no values.
3. "5" winze, 882 meters southwest of "D" winze: 1.85 ounces of silver, 0.65 ounces of gold over an average of 1.0 meter to a depth of 11 meters below outcrop. A 30-ton dump ran 2.28 ounces of silver and 0.82 ounces of gold.
4. "14" winze, 1,320 meters southwest of "D": 0.78 ounces of silver, 0.22 ounces of gold to 19 meters below outcrop. A 60-ton dump ran 0.15 ounces of silver, 1.14 ounces of gold; average of six dump samples was 0.68 ounces of silver, 0.31 ounces of gold. A surface sample representing a ten-meter width of vein structure gave 0.06 ounces of silver, 0.09 ounces of gold, including 1.5 meters of 0.40 ounces of silver and 0.50 ounces of gold on the footwall.
A 155 meter crosscut, driven to intersect the vein 62 meters vertically below surface and 80 meters northeast of "14" winze encountered only weak quartz mineralization. Of 20 samples taken in 45 meters of drift, one returned 10.25 ounces of silver and 0.35 ounces of gold over 1.20 meters and the remaining 19 averaged less than 0.40 ounces of silver and 0.05 ounces of gold.
On 30 meters of drifting up to seven meters below surface at "5" winze, 1,095.6 tons grading 1.66 ounces of silver and 0.505 ounces of gold were indicated.
The mineralization is the Potosi type, very finely banded, milky, aphanitic, sulfide-free quartz, with a gold-silver ratio similar to El Dorado's. No calcite was seen on the dumps. Wall rock alteration is not noticeable on surface, however fine grained silicification and pyritization of the andesite appears on the "5" winze dumps.
Modesto Mine Ore Reserves and Exploration Results
The exploration through March 31, 1997, has accomplished the following: Four bodies of gold ore have been blocked which contain approximately 18,800 ounces of a proven and probable grade of gold in 80,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.235 ounces of gold per ton.
The Modesto Mine appears to be a very good gold prospect. Since October 1993, three veins were discovered which extend over a length of one and one-half miles and a width of about one mile. The width of this area has a series of perpendicular and oblique tiny veins well dispersed which is a desirable ore for an open-pit operation. A total of 84 surface channel trenches was excavated; the 2,369 fire assay samples revealed an average grade of 0.035 ounces per ton.
The status of the three vein systems is as follows:
(1) Chicharron Vein: Over a length of 2,550 meters (8,415 feet), 69 surface channel trenches were dug consisting of 567.0 lineal meters (1,871 feet) from which 2,015 samples were taken which averaged a grade of 0.05 ounces of gold per ton. This vein strike is at north 50 degrees east with a dip 70 degrees and consists of milky, brownish grey and white quartz surrounded by andesite.
(2) Intermidy Vein: This vein is at an offset angle to the Paredon vein. A total of 495 meters (1,634 feet) of surface channel trenching was excavated and 265 assay samples reflected an average grade of 0.025 ounces of gold per ton.
(3) Paredon Vein: This vein was explored by excavating five surface channel trenches over 1,200 meters (3,960 feet) and 89 fire assay samples reflected an average grade of 0.015 ounces of gold per ton.
Underground workings:
(1) Taladron Adit: From this adit entrance to a point of 257 meters (848 feet) along the north 85 degrees west strike, all of the blockage was removed to penetrate it. A total of 80 fire assay samples were taken in the basalt and barren quartz monzonite veinlits which assays averaged 0.035 ounces of gold per ton. This adit changed its direction to south 70 degrees west and at a point of 131 meters (423 feet) a broken vein with a basalt horse was intercepted. The former vein was found at the end of this adit which turned to the west and encountered the Chicharron vein which at this point was 13 meters (43 feet) in width and 26 meters (86 feet) from the top of the hill. More than 20 assay samples are waiting to be fire assayed.
(2) Adit No. 10: This adit is above the Taladron Adit and it is the highest adit on this property. A total of 47 meters (155 feet) has been excavated and the 310 fire assay samples confirmed an average grade of 0.03 ounces of gold per ton. This adit follows a strike vein south 50 degrees west with a 55 degree easterly dip and encounters a vein at a width of 4.50 meters or 15 feet.
(3) Shaft No. 5: From the adit entrance, a total of 13.4 meters (44 feet) was cleaned. A sub level was discovered and this was cleaned at both ends north and south for a distance of 95.7 meters (316 feet) and 327 samples were fire assayed disclosing an average grade of 0.37 ounces of gold per ton. A total of 490 samples were taken from this sub level and from interconnecting levels. 75 samples were fire assayed revealing an average grade of 0.11 ounces of gold per ton.
(4) Shaft No. 7: This adit was recently opened to follow a vein and it is too premature to provide meaningful results.
The Joint Venture employs from 25 to 30 employees to work at this mine exploration program.
Modesto Mine Present Status
After completing the necessary surveying, mapping and planning, the Joint Venture proceeded to clean and trench the surface and adit vein exposure. Since August 1993, 3,084 metric feet of surface channel trenching (10,177 feet) and 866 meters (2,858 feet) of adit cleaning were completed. In addition, four inclines have been completed. A total of 4,027 fire assay samples were performed. The Joint Venture will continue the channel trenching and the reopening of the former adits as well as to formalize its own drilling program.
Modesto Mine Concession/Ownership
On or about September 2, 1993, the Joint Venture through one of its employees, filed an application with the El Salvador Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons to explore the 4,000 hectares (9,800 acres) of property known as the Modesto Mine. The application, together with the consent to explore this area from the property owners owning more than 25% of total area, has been submitted to the El Salvador Director of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons. Also, the Joint Venture had submitted its original plan to this governmental agency on January 24, 1994, outlining its exploration program. In order to comply with the current mining regulations adopted by the Government of El Salvador during February 1996, the Joint Venture filed an exploration concession application on April 21, 1997.
Hormiguero Mine ("Hormiguero")
Hormiguero Location
The Hormiguero is located approximately five miles southeast from SCMP off of the Pan American Highway in the Departments of San Miguel and Morazan, Comacaran Jurisdiction, in the Republic of El Salvador. The Joint Venture plans to survey, map, plat, plan and develop an exploration program.
Hormiguero Current Status
The Joint Venture continues to develop an exploration program on the 5,000 acre site. An application for exploration has been filed on September 6, 1993 with the Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons, a division of the El Salvador Minister of Economy's office. In order to comply with the El Salvadoran Mining Law adopted during February 1996, a current exploration application was filed on April 21, 1997.
The Hormiguero property continues to be in the stages of being mapped geologically and topographically on a referenced grid in order to provide a base to plan a drilling program with the objective to prove that a commercial body of ore may extend below the bottom of the former workings. This drilling activity would also determine if the faulted north end of the Gallardo vein continues. Further drilling could evidence the mineralization of unexplored veins.
1. Tailings: In an area of approximately 15,744 square meters (approximately four acres) 35 test pit holes at a total depth of 322 meters (1,063 feet) were excavated and the 705 samples that were fire assayed showed an average of 0.064 ounces of gold per ton times 150,000 tons should contain 9,600 ounces of gold.
2. A total of 11 surface channel trenches consisting of 310 meters (1,023 feet) were dug perpendicular to the Guadalupe vein and from a total of 155 samples, 96 samples verified an average grade of 0.0177 ounces of gold per ton.
3. Taladron Adit: The purpose is to clean this adit in an attempt to intercept the Guadalupe vein at 61 meters (201 feet) below surface. So far 35 meters (116 feet) have been cleaned.
Hormiguero Geology and Historical Information
The following information was obtained from a report entitled, "Mining in El Salvador-United Nations Development Programs 1968-1971,":
". . . From 1913 to 1918 the Comacaran Gold Mining Co. produced 607,062 ounces of silver and 72,142 ounces of gold from 208,096 tons. (Swanquist), and when this company liquidated in 1919 the El Salvador Silver Mining Co., formed by some of the Butters Co. personnel, continued operations on a small scale until 1921. In 1930 the mine was reopened by the original property owners, the Gonzalez family, and functioned periodically until 1948, producing during the last 3 years about 21,000 ounces of silver and 3700 ounces of gold. "Straight arithmetic averaging from the production figures gives an overall recovered grade of 0.351 oz. gold and 2.92 oz. silver for the period 1913-1918, or assuming a 10% mill less, a mill head of 0.386 oz. gold and 3.21 oz. silver. Mill records for 1917, the only surviving technical data, give a bullion production of 139,369.36 ounces of silver and 17,193.84 ounces of gold from 61,890 tons. A mill head calculated from this, again at 10% mill loss, was probably 0.30 ounces gold and 2.47 ounces silver."
"Although known locally . . . as Hormiguero' the deposit is actually a composite of three separate sections, the Gallardo, Guadalupe and Hormiguero, all in coarse-grained andesite, grouped about and formerly connected by aerial tramway to a central mill situated immediately southwest of the Canton Hormiguero. The Gallardo and Guadalupe veins are strong, persistent structures striking 045 degrees and 020 degrees respectively and forming thin ridges 500 feet east and 1,750 feet west of the central mill. Both are composite and slightly braided structures composed of two main parallel branches 70 feet apart, and several interconnecting sub-branches, all dipping greater than 60 degrees west. Vein material is banded and crustiform quartz-calcite, secondary manganese oxides and probaly [sic] rhodochrosite, weakly mineralized with pyrite, spalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Strong proplylitization accompanied by considerable pyrite has attacked the andesites outward for about ten feet from the walls resulting in the formation of yellowish red, clayey oxidation products on surface.
"The Gallardo has been worked on six levels for 2050 feet along strike and 400 feet vertically. Access was through the Benjamin adit at the extreme southwest end and an inclined (61 degrees) shaft 350 feet from the northeast end. Two vertically plunging ore shoots 300 and 600 long and 500 feet apart were stoped to the 5th level where the larger bottomed, according to notations on a long section made by the El Salvador Silver Mining Co. in 1920. Limited stoping above the Benjamin adit suggests a third shoot in that area and a possible unexplored prolongation of the vein towards the southwest. An abrupt cut-off of the north (larger) ore shoot coincident with the north end of the mine may be due to lateral fault displacement; an undeveloped segment of the vein might therefore be anticipated further north.
"Horizontal development of the Guadalupe vein opened a 1600 foot strike length on both a hanging wall and footwall branch, but the dip, exposed on five levels to 350 feet has been examined in an unsystematic manner more suitable for exploration than exploitation. Little ore has in fact been taken from underground; most of the production appears to have come from open cuts. The only regular mining has been confined to a 400 foot lens on the footwall branch, 150 feet south of the main three-compartment production shaft, which was from surface 200 feet vertically to the third level, and from a small irregular shoot directly opposite it in the footwall branch. Outside of these, the underground layout leaves the general impression that the distribution of ore grade mineralization is highly erratic and randomly dispersed.
"1100 feet, and north of the Gallardo and Guadalupe mines, five steeply north (?) dipping, parallel, curving veins (Emilio, Oriente Emilio, Hormiguero, San Francisco and 4 de Julio) evenly spaced over a width of 200 feet, constitute the separate Hormiguero mine. They lie between the hypothetical northward prolongation of the Gallardo and Guadalupe structures and have been worked over an aggregate strike length of 1200 feet starting from a point 700 feet west of the Guadalupe projection first 500 feet east-west then through a 700 foot arc curving to the southwest into alignment width, and 900 feet north of the north end of the Gallardo vein. At least 7 levels were developed to a depth of over 400 feet from a vertical 2 compartment shaft. The amount of stoping is unknown; the available data show that irregular 100 to 200 foot long shoots were worked to depths of 300 and 400 feet on the east-west striking portions of the San Francisco and 4 Julio veins.
"Four other virtually unexplored veins known as La Gloria or Esperanza, Victoria or Tilden, Tecolote and El Dorado, occur 500 to 900 feet west of the Gallardo and Hormiguero mines. The Gloria and Tecolote strike east-west; the remaing [sic] two are roughly parallel to the Gallardo. In a letter dated 1919, a geologist named Mr. Swanquist states that initial exploration and very limited mining obtained encouraging results' from the Tecolote and fair ore' from the El Dorado.
"The same letter mentions two additional prospects, the Consuelo of unknown location but 700 feet from the plant and just being opened up' and the La Posa, on the Las Garzas river, north of Canton Hormiguero from which ore grading $10.92 per ton ($20.00 gold and $1.11? [.385] silver), with values mainly in silver, was mined over 4 to 5 foot widths, in a 35 foot winze."
In 1921, i.e. during El Salvador Silver Mine's final year of operation, the following ore reserves were blocked out:
Proven: (U.S. dollar values based on a $20.00 per ounce gold price and a $0.385 per ounce silver price.)
Tons Grade Dollar Value Per Ton ------ ----- -------------------- Guadalupe Hanging Wall Vein 11,208 0.353 $7.06 Guadalupe Footwall Vein 7,528 0.319 $6.37 Hormiguero and Gallardo 10,000 0.400 $8.00 ------ Total: 28,736 Probable: Tons Grade Dollar Value Per Ton ------ ----- -------------------- Guadalupe Hanging Wall Vein 21,900 0.295 $5.89 Guadalupe Footwall Vein 23,556 0.340 $6.80 ------ Total: 45,456
(Proven and probable gold and silver ore reserves total 74,192 tons.)
Exploration should center on the undeveloped veins, on the possibility of extending the Hormiguero veins farther to the east and west, and on the unexplored ground between the north end of the Gallardo vein and the Hormiguero.
Hormiguero Ownership
The surface is owned by various individuals and families.
Montemayor Mine ("Montemayor")
Montemayor Location/Ownership
The Joint Venture has obtained permission from a number of property owners which permits the Joint Venture to enter their property for the purpose of exploring, exploiting and developing the property and then, if feasible, to mine and extract minerals from this property. The term of this permission is for an infinite period. Montemayor is located about 14 miles northeast of the SCMP, six miles northwest of the SSGM and about two miles east of the City of San Francisco Gotera in the Department of Morazan, Republic of El Salvador. Historical records evidence that the potential for the Montemayor to become an exploration and development gold-producing prospect is good.
Montemayor Geology and Historical Information
The following information was obtained from a report entitled, "Mining in El Salvador-United Nations Development Program 1968-1971":
"Montemayor-Lola Area
"The eastern and northeastern limits of the Three Corners area are defined by a scattering of three small mines and numerous prospects distributed along the course of the south-flowing Rio Montemayor in a system of parallel normal faults collectively known as the Montemayor lineament'. Consistent with the origin proposed under General Geology' these have been probably induced by subsidence along the northern margin of the central graben, resulting in a progressive tensional failure that has sliced the pyroclastic rocks of the area into a series of tabular blocks stepped successively upward to the northeast end culminating in the steep serrated ridges of the Copetillos escarpment. This has resulted in the creation of a 13,000 foot-wide regional sheeted' zone composed of closely spaced, northwest striking, west dipping parallel faults, stretching for five miles northeast along the river and has imported to the river gorge an assymetric cross section whose higher, northeast slope is underlain by deeply dissected acid to basic tuffs and lower southwest slope by the low rolling andesitic, Three Corners terrain.
"Extensive veining in the fragmentals has produced a lengthy mineralized zone roughly coincident with the sheating,' which includes the Montemayor deposit near the headwaters of the river and, arranged in en-echelon alignment downstream, the Tebanco, Lola, and Tepeyac occurrences and the minor Salamanca, Jimerito, Mina Grande, Copetilla and La Joya showings.
"The veins, which dip almost universally 50 degrees to 80 degrees southwest, are normal quartz-calcite, sulfide-poor fracture fillings, distinguished by their remarkable lateral persistence and unfortunate paucity of workable ore shoots. Sporadically distributed in lenses three to eight feet wide and up to 200 feet long and separated by longer stretches of barren ground, these have so far yielded enough tonnage to sustain mining operations only at the marginal Mina Lola. On the whole, however, the area is little explored.
"Montemayor
"The Montemayor property embraces a group of small mine openings and prospects aligned along a series of parallel southeast striking veins following the course of the Montemayor river for 16,000 feet, from its headwaters to the beginning of the pronounced S' bend enclosing the old Tabanco mine. Some confusion over the names and locations of these various workings has always existed; for the purpose of this report, the following nomenclature, adapted from early maps of the district, will be employed. Proceeding upstreams [sic], the workings are:
"(a) Montemayor-comprises the Montemayor, Montanita and Santa Gertrudis sections, extending for 2700 feet upstream from the Caserio Montemayor.
"(b) Tempisque-4800 feet north of the Caserio Montemayor and 1200 feet up the east bank of the river.
"(c) Banadero-Carao-Carago-4500 to 8000 feet upstream from Tempisque.
"Mining was confined to Montemayor; appreciable underground exploration to Montemayor and Tempisque. No motor road reaches the properties; access is either by five kms. of the mule trail along the southwest bank of the river from the end of the Santa Rosa de Lima-Caserio El Tabanco road or cross-country about the same distance by mule trail from a north branch of the Gigante road. Trails also lead into the headwater area from the town of Sociedad.
"Historical information is sketchy. The area was almost certainly worked in conjunction with the Tabanco mine, first by the English company until about 1855, then the Cia. Francesa de Minas de El Salvador who operated it some time between 1856 and 1882 (Guzman). Until 1914 (?) no information is forthcoming; then the mine was comprehensively sampled by the Butters Co. and its successors between 1915 and 1921 and by the R.W. Habard Co. and Central American Mines around 1936. Apparently the only production from 1856 to 1936 was obtained by the English and French companies but the figures are unknown.
"Roberts and Irving report that the mine was again functioning at 60 tons per day in 1945 under Sr. Benjamin Gonzalez, yielded a value of $233,818 over a three year period. Grebe (1955) does not confirm this and the data may refer to the Hormiguero mine which Sr. Gonzalez had in production at that time. Finally in 1963 the principal showings were taken up by a local enterprise, Minas Montemayor, S.A. and received a little more attention up until 1967.
"The vein system is apparently controlled by a simple set of poorly exposed, northwest striking faults paralleling the river and outcropping occasionally in the river bed and rarely on the steep east slope of the river gorge. Dips are to the southwest between 50 degrees and 60 degrees. Vein mineralization is quartz-calcite with weak disseminated pyrite and a small quantity of chalcopyrite, spalerite and galena. The host rocks are a succession of coarse andesitic tuffs and agglomerates, fine acid tuffs and flows propylitized along the veins, and locally silicified towards the north end of the zone of mineralization.
"Formal mining was confined to three parallel veins spaced over a 500 foot interval up the east bank from the creek, at Montemayor. The footwall Montanita vein was opened for 200 and 250 feet respectively on two levels about 70 feet apart, served by a winze and two crosscuts, and stoped over 100(?) feet on the upper level and 200(?) feet on the lower. Two levels opened at 115 and 215 feet off a 2 compartment shaft traced the middle (Montemayor) vein for 640 feet and disclosed a 200 foot long ore shoot, centered on the shaft and partially stoped before 1917, that might have graded around 12 ounces silver and 0.29 ounces gold. On this same structure, 1250 feet north of the shaft in the separate Santa Gertrudis section, perhaps 9000 tons grading $31.00 at gold and silver $0.507 were extracted from a 90 by 220 foot area, averaging 7 feet wide, developed on four levels through a second vertical shaft.
"The hanging wall sulfide' vein located 40 feet west of the Montemayor is apparently more heavily mineralized but contained no ore over 75 feet of drifting driven from the lower Montemayor level.
"On the Tempisque showing, two levels, 30 feet apart vertically and served by two adits, have revealed 520 feet of the Tempisque vein running 5.49 oz. silver and 0.14 oz gold over a 2.7 foot width, according to sampling by the R.W. Hebard Co. in 1936. Check sampling by the present owners in 1966 returned an indicated grade of 3.68 oz. silver and 0.115 oz. gold over four feet, on the lower level.
"Work on the Carago section has been purely exploratory; the only surviving records (map MM-8) show an average width of 2.3 feet of 9.95 ounces silver and 0.16 ounces gold in a 60 foot shaft and a 160 foot long drift, spaced 280 feet apart."
Montemayor Current Status
1. Surface channel trenching: From July 19, 1995, 55 surface channel trenches were excavated over a 920 meter (3,036 feet) length . In the Banadero area, from 29 trenches, 375 fire assay samples contained an average grade of 0.036 ounces of gold per ton.
The remaining 26 surface channel trenches were excavated in the Montemayor area: the 103 fire assay samples averaged 0.022 ounces of gold per ton.

Approximately 20 to 25 employees are employed at this site. On April 22, 1997, a current exploration concession was filed with the Minister of Economy's office in order to comply with the El Salvadoran Mining Law adopted on February 1996.
Comseb Laboratories (Lab)
The Joint Venture has two laboratories: one located at the SCMP facilities and the other on real estate owned by the Company near the SSGM site. At the SSGM Lab, the Joint Venture employs four employees for each of the twelve-hour shifts. A total of 58,924 samples of fire assays have been completed through March 31, 1997. Approximately four employees are working during the two eight-hour shifts at the SCMP laboratory.
Item 3.
