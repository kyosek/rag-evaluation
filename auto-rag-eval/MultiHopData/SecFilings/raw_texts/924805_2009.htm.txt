Item 2. Properties
Under the statutory scheme in the Republic of Kazakhstan prospective oil fields are developed in two stages. The first stage is an exploration and appraisal stage during which a private contractor is given a license to explore for oil and gas on a territory for a set term of years. During this stage the primary focus is on the search for a commercial discovery, i.e., a discovery of a sufficient quantity of oil and gas to make it commercially feasible to pursue execution of, or transition to, a commercial production contract with the government. Under the terms of an exploration contract the contract holder has the right to sell all oil and natural gas produced during the term of the exploration contract.
We currently own a 100% interest in a license to use subsurface mineral resources and a hydrocarbon exploration contract issued by the ROK in 1999 and 2000, respectively (collectively referred to herein as the (“license” or the “exploration contract”). When initially granted, the exploration and development stage of our exploration contract had a five year term, with provision for two extensions for a period of two years each. On June 24, 2008 the MEMR agreed to extend the exploration stage of our exploration contract until January 2013.
Initially, the exploration contract granted us the right to engage in exploration and development activities in an area of approximately 200 square kilometers referred to herein as the “ADE Block.” The ADE Block is comprised of three fields, the Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Emir fields. During our 2006 fiscal year our exploration contract was expanded to include an additional 260 square kilometers of land adjacent to the ADE Block, which we refer to herein as the “Southeast Block”, which includes the Kariman oil and gas field and the Borly and Yessen structures. In October 2008 the MEMR granted a further extension of the territory covered under our exploration contract to include an additional 390 square kilometer area, bring our total contract area to 850 square kilometers (approximately 210,114 acres). The additional territory is located to the north and west of our current exploration territory, extending the exploration territory toward the Caspian Sea and is referred to herein as the “Northwest Block.” The Southeast Block and the Northwest Block are governed by the terms of our exploration contract.
In order to be assured that adequate exploration activities are undertaken during exploration stage, the MEMR establishes an annual mandatory minimum work program to be accomplished in each year of the exploration contract. Under the minimum work program the contractor is required to invest a minimum dollar amount in exploration activities within the contract territory, which may include geophysical studies, construction of field infrastructure or drilling activities. During the exploration stage, the contractor is also required to drill sufficient wells in each field to establish the existence of commercially producible reserves in any field for which it seeks a commercial production license. Failure to complete the minimum work program requirements for any particular field during the term of the exploration contract could preclude the contractor from receiving a longer-term production contract for such field, regardless the success of the contractor in proving commercial reserves during the partial fulfillment of the minimum work program.
The contract we hold follows the above format. The contract sets the minimum dollar amount we must expend during each year of our work program. Through July 2009, our work program year ended on July 9 each year. As a result of certain changes to our exploration license, our work program year end has now changed to January 9 of each year through January 9, 2013. Therefore our work program year does not coincide with our fiscal year. As a result of these timing differences, the amounts reflected in the table below as “Actually Made” may differ from amounts disclosed elsewhere in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Consolidated Financial Statements, which present figures based on our fiscal year rather than our work program year.

As reflected in the above table, in connection with the extension of the term and territory of our exploration contract, we agreed to expend not less than $72.7 million dollars in additional work program activities through January 9, 2013.
Under the rules of the MEMR there is an option for expenditures above the minimum requirements in one period to be carried over to meet minimum obligations in future periods. As the above chart shows we have significantly exceeded the minimum expenditure requirement in each period of the contract and have more than doubled the total minimum capital expenditure requirement during the exploration stage.
In addition to mandatory minimum capital expenditures in each year, exploration contracts typically require the contract holder to drill a certain number of wells in each structure for which it plans to seek commercial production rights.
In Kazakhstan, typically, one exploratory well and two appraisal wells are sufficient to support a claim of commercially producible reserves in a particular field, although in some cases, commercial reserves have been demonstrated with fewer wells. The total number of wells the MEMR requires during exploration stage is generally determined by the number of fields or structures identified by the seismic studies done on a territory. 3D seismic studies completed on the ADE Block and the Southeast Block, have identified six potential fields or structures. We plan to perform 3D seismic studies on the Northwest Block to identify potential structures in that Block.
To date, we have drilled a total of 24 wells as set forth in more detail below:
(1) Addendum No. 6 to our exploratory contract requires the drilling of three exploratory wells. Depending upon the results of 3D seismic studies of the Northwest Block we may need to drill additional exploratory and appraisal wells in the Northwest Block.
*
Unknown at this time.
Pursuant to the terms of the extensions of our exploration contract, we will be required to drill not less than nine new wells by January 9, 2013. If we discover structures in the Northwest Block, we will need to drill additional wells to determine and establish the existence of commercially producible reserves within the various structures in our license territory.
The bottom half of the above chart shows current progress on drilling of exploratory and appraisal wells.
To date we have been conservative in our approach to exploration. It has been our practice to drill our first few wells serially. Our first well was the Dolinnoe-2 well drilled in 2004. This was followed by the Dolinnoe-3 well, and then the Aksaz-4 and Kariman-1 wells. While we have verified the presence of oil and gas in all our wells thus far, not all our wells produce oil at commercial levels. We have expended substantial time and money to study our wells.
The purpose of the exploration stage is to study the geology and geophysical characteristics of each field and individual well, with a view to qualifying for a longer-term production contract. Once drilling of a well is completed, our emphasis focuses on an extended period of testing a well’s production characteristics and capacities to determine the best method for producing oil from that well and to gain insight into the further development of the entire field. During exploration, oil production is subject to wide fluctuations caused by varying pressures commonly experienced in new wells and by significant periods of well closure to accommodate mandatory testing. Maximizing oil production only becomes the central focus during the post-exploration phase when exploiting the commercial discovery commences under a production contract.
Under our exploration contract, we have the exclusive right to apply for and negotiate a commercial production contract. The government is required to negotiate the terms of these rights in good faith in accordance with the Law of Petroleum of Kazakhstan. Based on discussions with the MEMR, the primary factors used by the MEMR in determining whether to grant commercial production rights are whether the contract holder has fulfilled the minimum work program commitments, proved the existence of a commercial discovery and submitted and received approval of a development plan prepared by a third-party petroleum institute in Kazakhstan for the exploitation of the established commercial reserves. All our efforts during exploration stage have and will continue to focus on meeting these criteria.
The terms of our commercial production rights will be negotiated at the time we apply to transition to commercial production. We became subject to a new tax code on January 1, 2009. Under the new tax code, the royalty we previously paid was replaced by a mineral extraction tax. The rate of the mineral extraction tax depends on annual production output. The new code currently provides for a 5% mineral extraction tax rate (6% in 2010 and 7% starting from 2011) on production sold to the export market, and a 2.5% tax rate (3% in 2010 and 3.5% starting from 2011) on production sold to the domestic market. In January 2009 we also became subject for a rent export tax, which is calculated based on the export sales price. This tax ranges from as low as 0% if the price is less than $40 per barrel to as high as 32% if the price per barrel exceeds $190.
Drilling Operations
During fiscal 2009 we completed six new wells in total. Three wells on the Kariman field, one well on the Dolinnoe field and two wells on the Aksaz field.
Our drilling strategy is aimed at geological exploratory drilling with the purpose of obtaining the in-depth information necessary for further exploration activities and transition to commercial production in the future, and drilling aimed at increasing production at the current stage.
Although not all of our wells have resulted in commercially viable production rates, drilling results have provided valuable information which we are using to construct geological and geophysical models of our fields, correction and amendments of 3D seismic results and more precise well location decision making procedures.
Well Performance and Production
The following table sets forth the number of oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of March 31, 2009.
As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, each of the 24 wells identified above was in test production, testing or under/awaiting workover.
According to the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, we are required to test every prospective target on our properties separately, this includes the completion of well surveys on different modes with various choke sizes on each horizon.
In the course of well testing, when the transfer from target to target occurs, the well must be shut in; oil production ceases for the period of mobilization/demobilization of the workover rig, pull out of the hole, run in the hole, perforation, packer installation time, etc. This has the effect of artificially diminishing production rates averaged over a set period of time.
During our fourth fiscal quarter, our average daily crude oil production was 2,961 barrels per day. Following is a brief description of the production rates of each of our 24 wells during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.

A first target was tested on March 27, 2008. The first week’s production was 110 bpd. In April 2008 it dropped to 63 bpd. For a couple of days the well was shut-in for a pressure build-up. After that production dropped to 26 bpd. We carried out an acid injection and hydro-impulsive cleaning and aeration, however, it hasn’t yielded significant results. We conducted bottom-hole zone cleaning to stimulate oil flow in August 2008. At the present moment, the well is producing sporadically. We intend to complete a comprehensive study of oil flow stimulation activities, including installation of various pumps should results of research provide indication of the possibility of production increase.
(2)
This well was completed during the quarter ended March 31, 2008. At the present moment, the well produces sporadically. We have lowered a down-hole pump but such activities yielded no significant results. We plan to continue sporadic production from this well without spending any significant additional funds for workover activities in the near future.
(3)
We have installed a downhole pump at the Kariman-1 well which continues to produce sporadically. We are investigating possibility of centrifugal pumps installation on this well.
(4)
We have installed a bottom-hole pump at this well. At the present moment we are researching various available options for increasing oil production rates from this well.
(5)
We have installed centrifugal submersible pumps at these wells. After a brief period of testing and fine tuning, production from this well stabilized. Stabilized production rates are included in the table above.
(6)
We expect to install a bottom-hole pump at the Kariman-5 well when a workover rig becomes available.

We have installed centrifugal submersible pumps at these wells. After a brief period of testing and fine tuning, production from this well stabilized. Stabilized production rates are included in the table above.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we reduced our planned capital expenditure program for the remainder of the fiscal year and the upcoming fiscal year.
During the past several years we have pursued an aggressive capital expenditure and drilling program. We pursued this aggressive strategy, in part, to complete our mandated exploration activities and move our contract territory to commercial production by July 2009, as our rights to the contract territory could have been terminated and reverted back to the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan had we not done so. With the grant of the extension of time to complete exploration activities, to January 2013, we now have more flexibility in the pace of our exploration drilling efforts and application for transition to commercial production.
As a result of reduced world oil prices and, corresponding reduction in our revenues, we do not have sufficient capital available to continue to support the aggressive drilling strategy we pursued during the past several years. The reduction in anticipated revenues from production is due to several factors, including, the material drop in world oil prices; several wells we have recently completed have not generated substantial production; the decline rates on existing wells has, in many cases, been more steep than expected due to the need for reworking and treatment to remove paraffin buildup occurring during a colder than normal winter; and the imposition by the Republic of Kazakhstan of an export duty on all oil sold outside the domestic market in Kazakhstan.
Another reason for the decrease in production and revenue was a lack of oil storage capacity. Given world market prices during the quarter, we were unwilling to export crude oil to international market due to the negative netbacks realized after application of the high export duty imposed by the government of Kazakhstan shortly before world market prices plummeted in August 2008. Such circumstances forced us to supply 100% of
our crude oil to domestic markets starting in late October 2008. This significant increase in the supply of crude oil to the domestic market in Kazakhstan led to low domestic prices and logistical issues as there is only one refinery that services western Kazakhstan oil producers. As a result several times during the quarter ending December 31, 2008, there were periods when we were unable to ship crude oil to the domestic market. This led to the crude oil inventories at the oil storage facility we lease to exceed storage capacity. As a result, we had to partially or completely (through choke scale down) shutdown several wells. Due to the pressure drop and paraffin build-up during such suspension of production, we were unable to return to the previous production rates at several wells.
We have developed and commenced a production restoration program based on installation and running of submersible centrifugal and bottom-hole pumps at non-producing or low-producing wells. We have completed installation of such pumps at the Kariman-4 and Kariman-7 wells during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. With the ingoing workover stimulation program we hope to restore the production level close to the levels experienced at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2008.
Based on the successful results of centrifugal pumps usage, we have proceeded with extensive workover program at the existing Kariman wellstock. In the period following the fiscal year 2009 we have continued installation of the centrifugal pumps at the Kariman-10 and Kariman-11 wells. We are currently engaged in installation of the bottom-hole pumps at the Kariman-3 and Kariman-5 wells. We believe we have identified a technique for oil flow stimulation and intensification suitable for the peculiar needs of the Kariman field. We plan to continue with this program and will install centrifugal pumps on as-needed basis on the Kariman wells where we believe the use of pumps will result in greater production than the natural flow rate.
We are also in the process of researching various available options for using similarly-designed pumps at the Dolinnoe and Aksaz fields, both of which have higher natural gas content making it impossible to apply the same equipment currently used on the Kariman field.
We expect to continue working with the existing wellstock for the reminder of the fiscal year ending 2010 with the purpose of increasing and sustaining production rates from existing wells.

We use sales volume rather than production volume for calculation of per unit cost because not all volume produced is sold during the period. The related production costs were expensed only for the units sold, not produced based on a matching principle of accounting. Therefore, oil and gas operating expense per BOE was calculated by dividing oil and gas operating expenses for the year by the volume of oil sold during the year.
