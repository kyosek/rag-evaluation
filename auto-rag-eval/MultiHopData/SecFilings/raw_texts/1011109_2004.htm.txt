ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
General
As previously noted in Item 1, as of March 21, 2005, we own:
·
one existing 403-unit apartment community (Addison Place) that includes a 285-unit garden apartment community (Addison Place Apartments) and a 118-unit townhome community (Addison Place Townhomes) in Alpharetta, Georgia that is stabilized;
·
a 319-unit apartment community in lease-up in Charlotte, North Carolina (Ballantyne Place);
·
a 42,090 square foot retail center in lease-up (Addison Place Shops);
·
a 1.0-acre undeveloped commercial site adjacent to the Addison Place Shops that we intend to sell;
·
a 39,907 square foot office building in lease-up in Atlanta, Georgia, a part of which we occupy as our corporate headquarters (Northridge office building);
·
a 10.9-acre site currently in the planning and design phase on which we intend to build a 220-unit apartment community (Northridge community);
·
an 82% undivided interest in 23.547 acres of undeveloped land zoned for 292 apartment units in Gwinnett County, Georgia (Peachtree Parkway land);
·
a 29.48-acre site of undeveloped land zoned for 109 condominium units, 15,000 square feet of retail space and a density of 500,000 square feet for a university education center in Alpharetta, Georgia (Westside land); and
·
a 9.84-acre site of undeveloped land zoned for 120 condominium units, 236 apartment units, 210,000 square feet of office space and 56,000 square feet of retail space in Atlanta, Georgia (Peachtree Dunwoody land).
On June 2, 2004, we sold five of our Atlanta apartment communities - Bradford Creek, Plantation Trace, Preston Oaks, River Oaks, and Veranda Chase, totaling 1,091 units - to Colonial Properties Trust. On July 29, 2004, we sold our St. Andrews at the Polo Club community in Palm Beach County, Florida.
We believe that in the long-term, the demand for multifamily housing in Atlanta will increase due to Atlanta’s growing population, although sluggish job growth in Atlanta has resulted in a weaker apartment market. According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which we refer to as the ARC, both population and job growth in Atlanta are projected to be above the national average for the foreseeable future. The ARC is the regional planning and governmental coordination agency for the 10-county Atlanta Region, which is composed of Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton, Rockdale, Henry, Douglas, Cherokee and Fayette counties.
The following information is based on statistical estimates published by the ARC. The estimated population of the Atlanta Region increased by 8.4% from 3,429,400 persons in 2000 to 3,716,100 persons in 2004, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and the largest in the Southeast. The population of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow to 3,886,900 persons in 2010.
Housing units in the Atlanta Region increased 459,259 units and 43.6% since 1990 and increased 10.1%, from 1,373,058 units in 2000 to 1,511,689 units in 2004. Multifamily homes in the Atlanta Region increased 6.4% from 416,682 units in 2000 to 443,318 units in 2004.
The following table summarizes basic information about our communities.
Other Properties and Properties Under Construction:
(1)
Addison Place was completed in two phases. Addison Place Townhomes, the 118-unit first phase, was completed in October 1999, and Addison Place Apartments, the 285-unit second phase, was completed in September 2001.
(2)
Ballantyne Place was completed in February 2005 and is in its lease-up phase. For this reason, its 12-month historical occupancy is not comparable.
(3)
The Northridge office building was completed in August 2004 and is in its lease-up phase. For this reason, its 12-month historical occupancy is not comparable.
Annual operating data at December 31, 2004 regarding Addison Place, our stabilized community that includes the Addison Place Townhomes and the Addison Place Apartments, is summarized in the following table. Except for those figures noted with an asterisk, the occupancy rates shown represent the average physical occupancy calculated by dividing the total number of vacant days by the total possible number of vacant days for each year and then subtracting the resulting number from 100%. The figures noted with asterisks reflect the applicable data on December 31 of the specified year and are not annualized because the applicable phase was under construction and in its initial lease-up period during at least a portion of that year. During lease-up, units are leased as they are constructed and made ready for occupancy building by building, thus annualization of data is not possible during that period. Throughout this table, “N/A” means “not applicable.”
As described below, our Atlanta community and undeveloped land are located primarily along the Georgia 400 corridor in Fulton and Gwinnett counties and three submarkets, or geographic areas, within these counties. We also have one community in Charlotte that is described after the Georgia properties. Each heading identifies the property or properties within the specified county and submarket. We obtained population and employment data for each Atlanta submarket from the ARC.
Fulton County
Fulton County is the largest county in the Atlanta Region in terms of population, employment, housing units and land area. Four of our properties are located in North Fulton County. North Fulton’s population was 205,970 at the end of 2000 and grew to 218,584 by 2004. The average North Fulton household income in 2003 was $103,190, which is 67% greater than the national average. Based on our market research, we believe North Fulton County has been adversely affected by the economic downturn. Our indicators include unemployment rates, apartment vacancies, business failures and mortgage foreclosures.
Alpharetta Area - Addison Place and Westside
Alpharetta. The Alpharetta area offers convenient proximity and access to both urban and suburban employment bases and retail conveniences. Georgia 400 provides direct access within minutes to major regional malls such as North Point Mall and Perimeter Center Mall. The Phipps Plaza/Lenox Mall/Buckhead area and downtown Atlanta’s Central Business District are readily accessible via the Georgia 400 extension, which connects to I-85 South near downtown Atlanta.
Within this corridor is a large base of residential, commercial and office developments. The success of Alpharetta’s North Point Mall accelerated the already high rate of residential development, which caters to the upscale consumer. North Fulton’s neighborhoods have been a major factor in the emergence of the Georgia 400 corridor as a center for corporate headquarters.
Addison Place Apartments and Townhomes. Addison Place is a 403-unit community located on Abbotts Bridge Road near the intersection of Abbotts Bridge and Jones Bridge roads. The first phase, the Addison Place Townhomes, contains 118 townhouses consisting of 60 two-bedroom townhouses of approximately 1,497 square feet each and 58 three-bedroom townhouses of approximately 1,903 square feet each. The second phase, the Addison Place Apartments, contains 285 garden-style apartment homes. It has 11 different floor plans, including 60 one-bedroom units ranging from 765 to 1,034 square feet, 147 two-bedroom units ranging from 1,150 to 1,550 square feet, 58 three-bedroom units at approximately 1,706 square feet and 20 four-bedroom units at approximately 2,074 square feet, along with 40 direct-entry garages. The weighted average unit size of the entire community is 1,498 square feet. The buildings are of a traditional design with stacked stone accents, brick and vinyl siding. The community features two swimming pools, a modern fitness and exercise facility, a business center, men’s and women’s saunas and a playground.
As of December 31, 2004, Addison Place was 93.8% occupied, and its monthly rental rates ranged from $815 to $1,925 per month, with a weighted average monthly rent of $1,039 per unit and $0.69 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $374,000 in 2004.
Westside. The Westside property is located between Haynes Bridge Road and Mansell Road within a 220-acre master planned development known as Westside. Our 29.48-acre site is zoned for 109 condominium units, 15,000 square feet of retail space and a density of 500,000 square feet for a university education center. Westside is a new upscale mixed-use development. Its master plan includes condominiums, office space, retail, university education and retirement housing, as well as Encore Park for the Arts, a 27-acre arts complex including a performing arts center and a 12,000-seat amphitheater. The property is located on Westside Parkway, directly across Georgia 400 from the North Point Mall and Office Park and is adjacent to a proposed MARTA rail station. We intend to develop the condominiums ourselves and engage a joint-venture partner to develop the retail space and education center. Because we have not begun to develop the property, we cannot yet estimate the cost to complete the improvements or how we will finance our development and construction activities.
Perimeter Center/North Springs Area - Northridge and Peachtree Dunwoody
Perimeter Center/North Springs. The Perimeter Center/North Springs area offers convenient proximity and access to both urban and suburban employment bases and retail conveniences. Georgia 400 and I-285 provide direct access within minutes to major regional malls such as Perimeter Center Mall and North Point Mall. The Phipps Plaza/Lenox Mall/Buckhead area and downtown Atlanta’s Central Business District are readily accessible via the Georgia 400 extension, which connects to I-85 South near downtown Atlanta.
The Perimeter Center submarket is one of the most dynamic office, retail and housing submarkets in the southeastern United States. It is Atlanta’s largest employment center outside of downtown Atlanta and is comprised of more than 27 million square feet of office space. The area currently has over 100,000 jobs and is projected to have over 180,000 jobs in the next 20 years. The south quadrant of the area includes medical facilities such as Northside Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Several prominent companies such as InterContinental Hotels Group, UPS, Cingular and Hewlett-Packard have located their worldwide or regional headquarters within the Perimeter Center area.
Northridge. The Northridge community will be located on a 10.9 acre site located adjacent to our former Highland Park community. We intend to construct a 220-unit upscale apartment community consisting of one and two-bedroom apartments with covered parking for residents. We expect to start construction by the end of 2005, and we estimate the total cost to be approximately $24 million.
Peachtree Dunwoody. The Peachtree Dunwoody property is a 9.84-acre site zoned for 120 condominium units, 236 apartment units, 210,000 square feet of office space and 56,000 square feet of retail space. The property is located on Peachtree Dunwoody Road across the street from MARTA’s North Springs rail station in the affluent Perimeter Center submarket of Atlanta. We intend to start the development of the apartments and condominiums ourselves by the end of 2005 and involve a joint-venture partner to develop the office and retail space. Because we have not begun to develop the property, we cannot yet estimate the cost to complete the improvements or how we will finance our development and construction activities.
Gwinnett County
From 2000 to 2004, Gwinnett’s population increased 14.0% to 670,800 persons. Gwinnett’s strong employment base, transportation networks, excellent public education system and affordable home prices contribute to the county’s growth. Gwinnett is home to approximately 235 international firms, over 860 manufacturing firms and 1,300 high technology firms that generate many of its 366,275 jobs. The average household income of the county is approximately $79,000. Our undeveloped land on Peachtree Parkway is in Gwinnett County.
Peachtree Corners Area - Peachtree Parkway
Peachtree Corners. The Peachtree Corners area is readily accessible from I-285, I-85 and Georgia 400, providing convenient proximity and access to both urban and suburban employment bases and retail conveniences. The upscale Forum shopping center anchors the shopping district located within Peachtree Corners. A major technology employment center in the area is Technology Park Atlanta, a 500-acre master-planned office development that is home to 138 companies in 3.8 million square feet of office space.
Peachtree Parkway. The Peachtree Parkway property is zoned for 292 apartment units. The 23.547-acre property is located on Peachtree Parkway at the intersection of Peachtree Corners Circle and across the street from the upscale Forum Shopping Center.
Charlotte, North Carolina
The following information is based on statistics and estimates published by the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. Between 1990 and 2004, Mecklenburg County’s population grew from 511,363 to 801,137 persons. It is projected to grow to a population of 990,525 by 2010. Employment has grown to a total of 405,325 residents employed in 2004. Five of the nation’s top 150 banks operate in Charlotte and the nation’s largest two banks based on deposits, Bank of America and Wachovia (formerly First Union Corporation), are both headquartered in Charlotte. Other major employers include Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System, Duke Energy Corporation and USAirways. Additionally, 286 of the nation’s largest industrial and service corporations listed by FORTUNE magazine have facilities in the area.
Ballantyne Place. Ballantyne Place is located on a 23.8-acre site at the intersection of Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) and John J. Delaney Drive in the Ballantyne area, the largest mixed-use development in Mecklenburg County. The community is located near I-485 and I-77, which offer convenient access to downtown Charlotte and I-85. Ballantyne Place has 319 garden-style apartments, consisting of 110 one-bedroom units ranging from 766 square feet to 1,030 square feet, 143 two-bedroom units ranging from 1,144 square feet to 1,550 square feet, 48 three-bedroom units at 1,783 square feet and 18 four-bedroom units at 2,081 square feet, along with 36 direct-entry garages.

Rental rates range from $885 to $1,630 per month, resulting in a weighted average monthly rent of $1,050 per unit and $0.83 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $329,000 in 2004.
The following table summarizes the amenities of each of our existing communities.
Competition
All of the communities are located in developed areas, and numerous other apartment projects are located within the market area of each community. The number of competitive apartment communities in the area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease our apartments at the current or anticipated rental rates, and we can give no assurances regarding the development of additional competing multifamily communities in the future. The remainder of this section summarizes the competition for each of the communities. The following information reflects our study of apartment communities in each submarket that we believe to be closely competitive with our community or communities within that submarket. This section includes summary information we obtained from various sources - including developers and real estate brokers, as well as on-site visits - regarding those apartment communities. Although we have attempted to verify the information and believe that it is substantially accurate on the whole, information regarding a particular community may be incorrect due to the sources relied upon or erroneous information supplied by competitors.
Addison Place. We believe the Addison Place multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately four-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the east, Old Alabama to the south, Georgia 400 to the west and Windward Parkway to the north, and it currently consists of approximately 12 communities, including Addison Place. We believe that Addison Place draws residents from all of the approximately 11 other communities located in the market area, which compete closely with Addison Place.
Westside. We believe the Westside multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by Alpharetta Highway to the west, Old Milton Parkway to the north, North Point Parkway to the east and Old Alabama to the south and currently consists of nine communities. We believe our Westside community will draw residents from the other nine communities located in the market area and that five of the nine communities will compete closely with the Westside community.
Northridge. We believe the North Springs multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around this planned community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the north and west, Georgia 400 to the east and Dalrymple Road to the south, and currently consists of 34 communities, including Highland Park, which we sold on August 6, 2003. Of the approximately 34 existing communities in the market area, only five have been built since 1989. The remaining communities range in age from 15 years to over 20 years. We believe our Northridge community will draw residents from all of the other 34 communities located in the market area, but only 11 of the 34 communities will compete closely with the Northridge community.
Peachtree Dunwoody. We believe that the north central Perimeter multifamily submarket includes the area within a two-mile radius around this planned community. It is generally bounded by Roswell Road to the west, Ashford Dunwoody Road to the east, Spalding Drive to the north and Glenridge Drive to the south. It currently consists of approximately 26 multifamily communities, including Preston Oaks, which we sold on June 2, 2004. Of the 26 existing communities in the market area, only six were built before 1983. The remaining 19 communities range from approximately two to 13 years of age. We believe that the Peachtree Dunwoody community will compete with all 26 of these communities.
Peachtree Parkway. We believe the Peachtree Corners multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately four-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by Peachtree Industrial to the east, Holcomb Bridge Road to the south, Jones Bridge Road to the west and State Bridge Road to the north and currently consists of 35 communities. We believe our Peachtree Parkway community, should we choose to develop it, will draw residents from all of the other 35 communities located in the market area, but only five of the 35 communities will compete closely with the Peachtree Parkway community.
Ballantyne Place. We consider the Charlotte multifamily submarket to include the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the community. It is generally bounded by Providence Road to the east, Providence Road West to the south, Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) to the west and I-485 to the north, and it currently consists of approximately nine communities, including our Ballantyne Place. We believe that Ballantyne Place draws residents from all of the approximately eight other existing communities located in the market area, which compete with Ballantyne Place.
Summary of Debt Secured by Our Properties

Possible Additional Communities to Be Developed
From time to time Roberts Properties plans the development of other apartment communities to be located on property owned by Roberts Properties or other affiliates of Mr. Roberts, or on property that one of those entities is interested in acquiring. We may acquire those properties from Mr. Roberts or his affiliates after complying with our conflict of interest policies and our code of ethics and business conduct. We have recently acquired two undeveloped properties from affiliates of Mr. Roberts in that manner. Please see Item 1, Description of Business, Item 10, Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant and Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for more information about these matters.
Other Real Estate Assets
In addition to the communities, we own the Addison Place Shops, a 42,090 square foot retail center at the intersection of Abbotts Bridge Road and Jones Bridge Road in Alpharetta, Georgia and located directly in front of our Addison Place apartment community. We have completed construction of this retail center except for the interior tenant finish, and we have begun the lease-up. We entered into a cost plus 5% contract with Roberts Construction to build the retail center.
We also own an office building on Northridge Parkway in Atlanta, Georgia. We occupy a portion of one floor of the building as our corporate headquarters; and we have entered into leases for the remaining space on that floor with Roberts Properties and Roberts Construction and plan to lease the other two floors to unaffiliated tenants.
See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions - Transactions with the Roberts Companies, for more information about the payment of fees to the Roberts Companies in connection with the development and construction of these projects.
ITEM 3.
