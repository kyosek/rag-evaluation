TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED LOGISTICS
The Company has a 60% interest in the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") that own 89 refrigerated warehouses with an aggregate of approximately 445 million cubic feet. AmeriCold Logistics leases all of the partnerships' facilities. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
On March 11, 1999, the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships sold all of the non-real estate assets of Temperature Controlled Logistics encompassing the operations of the temperature controlled business for approximately $48,700,000 to a new partnership ("AmeriCold Logistics") owned 60% by Vornado Operating Company and 40% by Crescent Operating Inc. AmeriCold Logistics leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in this business from the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") which continue to own the real estate. The leases, as amended, generally have a 15 year term with two-five year renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage rent based on revenue AmeriCold Logistics receives from its customers. On February 22, 2001, the Landlord restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to, among other things, (i) reduce 2001's contractual rent to $146,000,000, (ii) reduce 2002's contractual rent to $150,000,000 (plus contingent rent in certain circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlord's share of annual maintenance capital expenditures by $4,500,000 to $9,500,000 effective January 1, 2000 and (iv) allow AmeriCold Logistics to defer rent to December 31, 2003 to the extent cash is not available, as defined in the leases, to pay such rent. Based on the Company's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281,000 and $8,606,000 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to pay $39,812,000 of deferred rent of which the Company's share was $23,887,000. This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company.
During 2001, the Landlord completed a 125,000 square foot warehouse at its Atlanta, Georgia complex and has acquired the original 104,000 square foot warehouse in Tarboro, North Carolina, which is subject to a capital lease. These transactions were completed at a total cost of $25,807,000.
AmeriCold Logistics provides the frozen food industry with refrigerated warehousing and transportation management services. Refrigerated warehouses are comprised of production and distribution facilities. Production facilities typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors, located nearby. These customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in the facility until they are shipped to the next stage of production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide variety of customers' finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each distribution facility generally services the surrounding regional market. AmeriCold Logistics' transportation management services include freight routing, dispatching, freight rate negotiation, backhaul coordination, freight bill auditing, network flow management, order consolidation and distribution channel assessment. AmeriCold Logistics' temperature-controlled logistics expertise and access to both frozen food warehouses and distribution channels enable its customers to respond quickly and efficiently to time-sensitive orders from distributors and retailers.
AmeriCold Logistics' customers consist primarily of national, regional and local frozen food manufacturers, distributors, retailers and food service organizations. A breakdown of AmeriCold Logistics' largest customers during 2001 include:

Further, Alexander's has obtained a $68,000,000 interest only, non-recourse mortgage loan on the property from a third party lender. The interest rate on the debt is 5.92% with interest payable monthly until maturity in October, 2011. The triple net rent each year is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service on the mortgage loan. If the purchase option is not exercised at the end of the 20th year, the triple net rent for the last 20 years must include debt service sufficient to fully amortize the $68,000,000 over the remaining 20 year lease period.
(5) Alexander's has completed the excavation and foundation for its Lexington Avenue property development project. The development plan is to construct a 1.4 million square foot multi-use building comprised of a commercial portion, which may include a combination of retail stores and offices, and a residential portion consisting of condominium units. There can be no assurance that the residential portion will be built. The funding required for the proposed building will be in excess of $650,000,000. Alexander's is exploring various alternatives for financing the project, including equity, debt, joint ventures and asset sales, which may involve arrangements with the Company.
On May 1, 2001 Alexander's entered into a lease agreement with Bloomberg L.P. for approximately 700,000 square feet of office space. The initial term of the lease is for 25 years, with one ten-year renewal option. Base annual net rent is $34,221,000 in each of the first four years and $38,226,000 in the fifth year with a similar percentage increase each four years thereafter. There can be no assurance that this project ultimately will be completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount. If the project is not completed on a timely basis, the lease may be cancelled by the tenant and significant penalties may apply.
On January 12, 2001, Alexander's sold its Fordham Road property located in the Bronx, New York for $25,500,000, which resulted in a gain of $19,026,000. In addition, Alexander's paid off the mortgage on this property at a discount, which resulted in an extraordinary gain from early extinguishment of debt of $3,534,000 in the first quarter of 2001.
THE NEWKIRK MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
In 1998, the Company and affiliates of Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund III, L.P. ("Apollo") formed a joint venture to acquire general and limited partnership interests in the Newkirk real estate partnerships. Since its formation, the joint venture has acquired equity interests in 91 partnerships which own approximately 19.7 million square feet of real estate and first and second mortgages secured by a portion of these properties. The Company owned a 30% interest in the joint venture with the balance owned by Apollo. On January 1, 2002, the Newkirk partnerships were merged into The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership (the "MLP") to create a vehicle to enable the partners to have greater access to capital and future investment opportunities. In connection with the merger, the Company received limited partner interests in the MLP equal to an approximate 21.1% interest and Apollo received limited partner interests in the MLP equal to an approximate 54.5% interest. Further, the joint venture is the general partner of the MLP.

The Company's share of the joint venture debt was approximately $263,952,000 at December 31, 2001.
In conjunction with the merger, the MLP completed a $225,000,000 secured financing collateralized by its interests in the entities that own the properties, subject to the existing first and certain second mortgages on those properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 3% (8.5% at February 1, 2002) and matures on January 31, 2005, with two one-year extension options. As a result of the financing, on February 6, 2002 the MLP repaid approximately $28,200,000 of existing joint venture debt and distributed approximately $37,000,000 to the Company.

As of February 1, 2002, the occupancy rate of the properties was 100%.
