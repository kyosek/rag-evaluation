RECENT ISSUANCE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES
Since its incorporation on April 12, 2006, Cavit has issued the following securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933:
Cavit believes that all of the above transactions were transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, since (a) each of the transactions involved the offering of such securities to a substantially limited number of persons; (b) each person took the securities as an investment for his/her/its own account and not with a view to distribution; (c) each person had access to information equivalent to that which would be included in a registration statement on the applicable form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; (d) each person had knowledge and experience in business and financial matters to understand the merits and risks of the investment; and (e) appropriate restrictive legends were placed on all stock certificates. Therefore, no registration statement needed to be in effect prior to such issuances.
The Company did not utilize or engage a principal underwriter in connection with any of the above securities transactions.
On October 26, 2007, Cavit issued a series of Class H warrants to purchase Cavit common stock to four of its original investors in consideration for said four investors forever waiving their anti-dilution rights with respect to future issuances of Cavit common stock. The names of the Class H warrant holders, the number of shares of common stock covered by the Class H warrants, the exercise price of the Class H warrants and the term of the Class H warrants are as follows:
Name of Holder Number of Shares Covered Exercise Price Term -------------- ------------------------ -------------- ---- Raymond Bazley 100,000 $ .55 Sixty months Cortland Fund, LLC 100,000 $ .55 Sixty months Margaret Smyth 100,000 $ .55 Sixty months Robert Hennen 13,334 $ .55 Sixty months
On January 11, 2008, Cavit, acting pursuant to its November 29, 2007, Agreement with Vision International Enterprises, S.A. (Exhibit 10.8 to this Annual Report), issued a series of warrants to purchase Cavit common stock.
While the majority of the language, terms and conditions of the various warrants are identical, the warrants differ in four areas: (i) class designation of warrants; (ii) number of shares of common stock covered by the warrants; (iii) exercise price of the warrants and (iv) term of the warrants. The following table explains the differences in the terms of the warrants:
Number of Class of Warrants Shares Covered Exercise Price Term - ----------------- -------------- -------------- ---- A 125,000 $ .40 Six months B 125,000 $ .60 Nine months C 125,000 $ .80 Twelve months D 175,000 $1.00 Fifteen months E 175,000 $1.25 Eighteen months F 175,000 $1.50 Twenty-one months G 175,000 $1.75 Twenty-four months I 250,000 $2.00 Thirty-six months J 175,000 $3.00 Forty-eight months
On January 11, 2008, Cavit, acting pursuant to its November 29, 2007, Agreement with Isthmus Investments Management, S.A. (Exhibit 10.9 to this Annual Report), issued a series of warrants to purchase Cavit common stock.
While the majority of the language, terms and conditions of the various warrants are identical, the warrants differ in four areas: (i) class designation of warrants; (ii) number of shares of common stock covered by the warrants; (iii) exercise price of the warrants and (iv) term of the warrants.
The following table explains the differences in the terms of the warrants:
Number of Class of Warrants Shares Covered Exercise Price Term - ----------------- -------------- -------------- ---- A 125,000 $ .40 Six months B 125,000 $ .60 Nine months C 125,000 $ .80 Twelve months D 175,000 $1.00 Fifteen months E 175,000 $1.25 Eighteen months F 175,000 $1.50 Twenty-one months G 175,000 $1.75 Twenty-four months I 250,000 $2.00 Thirty-six months J 175,000 $3.00 Forty-eight months
Cavit believes that all of the above transactions were transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, since (a) each of the transactions involved the offering of such securities to a substantially limited number of persons; (b) each person took the securities as an investment for his/her/its own account
and not with a view to distribution; (c) each person had access to information equivalent to that which would be included in a registration statement on the applicable form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; (d) each person had knowledge and experience in business and financial matters to understand the merits and risks of the investment; and (e) appropriate restrictive legends were placed on all stock certificates.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
MANAGEMENT'S PLAN OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our plan of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors," "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or in other parts of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any information in our forward-looking statements except as required by law.
PATENT ACQUISITION INFORMATION
Hard to Treat began to internally develop the intellectual property rights during 2004, that were acquired by Cavit on May 31, 2006, as part of the operations of Hard to Treat's biotechnology division. During 2004, research and development commenced, which was the foundation for the first patent application being filed during December of 2004. As a result of additional research and development in 2005, two additional patent applications were filed in December 2005.
The boards of directors of Cavit Sciences and Hard to Treat determined the value of the intangible assets and related costs acquired to be $145,459; comprised of $56,997 in capitalized legal fees associated with the development of the rights from inception and $88,462 of direct research and development which are considered purchased R&D and have been expensed in the December 31, 2006 financial statements. The $145,459 carved out cost determined the value of the intangible assets. The acquisition costs do not include $47,060 of certain overhead expenses incurred by Hard to Treat during the development of the intellectual property rights from inception that began in 2004. The overhead expenses of $47,060 that were not part of the purchase price paid by Cavit included wages, rent, phone and other expenditures that Hard to Treat incurred to develop the intellectual properties.
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, due to Financial Accounting Standards, the Company recorded impairment charges of $250, 000 and $86,997, respectively, which was primarily due to the fact that such assets and patents are not currently producing revenues or cash flows. The book value of the assets and patent application rights do not reflect the future potential of our supplement line and patents as the supplement line is being manufactured and the patent rights are still in the application phase.
Cavit was incorporated on April 12, 2006 and acquired intellectual property rights from Hard to Treat on May 31, 2006. In July 2006, Cavit acquired additional rights in some of these intellectual property rights, resulting in Cavit owning 100% of such rights.
During 2007, Cavit filed an additional PCT Utility patent application, six National Phase applications, and two Continuation-In-Part applications. Cavit's intellectual property rights currently consist of twelve patent applications.
OVERVIEW
We are a development-stage company and have a limited operating history. Cavit Sciences, Inc. was formed on April 12, 2006, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hard to Treat Diseases, Inc., to acquire certain intellectual property rights from Hard to Treat Diseases and to develop and market the acquired rights.
Major drug companies are interested in drugs that are safe and effective in treating and preventing certain indications and conditions, have secure intellectual property rights and have an available source and supply of the composition. Cavit's board has decided to focus on and to pursue the best course of action in the interest of patients and shareholders. Testing performed on certain drugs has resulted in patent applications and numerous intellectual property rights which are owned and controlled by Cavit. We intend to manufacture, per U.S. FDA specifications, one of the drugs we tested and to file for U.S. FDA approval for certain cancer and/or viral infection indications. In addition to the current utility rights we own, Cavit will have a source and control of the drug. Due to the safety and effectiveness of the drug's use outside the U.S., Cavit will apply for fast track or priority approval by the U. S. FDA.
Our initial plan was to market our intellectual property rights to major drug companies. We have been and are currently negotiating with other drug companies regarding securing rights to their drug compositions. The combination of our current utility rights and the acquisition of composition rights should allow Cavit to develop market and commercialize these drugs successfully.
In addition, Cavit acquired a food supplement line during February 2007. As a result of agreements entered into with Daycon Investors Associates, Inc., Americare Nutritional Division and Dr. Jospeh P. D'Angelo, Cavit acquired the foundation of two premium supplement lines which were developed during 2007. The core products in Cavit's supplement lines will enhance and improve the prostate, maintain and support the cardiovascular system, and beneficially effect arthritis and osteoporosis. Superior results have been attained by individuals with the use of Cavit's products. These proven results are due to the research and testing of the most effective formulas with nutrients that support and supplement each other at the optimum dosage of each ingredient. Cavit intends to
manufacture, market, distribute and commercialize a range of supplements to act as powerful antioxidants and immune enhancers which have beneficial effects upon many serious diseases.
Cavit's current facilities accommodate its laboratories, research and development, warehouse and corporate offices. The facilities provide ample room for the development of the food supplement lines. The plants laboratories will be used for ongoing research and development of existing products and products being developed with innovation as our trend. The facilities also accommodate Cavit's plant equipment, staff, and relocated corporate headquarters and allow for future expansion.
The food supplement lines are an ideal match with our drug development process. In addition to creating a full range biotech company, the supplement line will create a steady stream of cash flow to support the commercialization of our drugs.
We have not generated any profits since our entry into the biotechnology business, have no source of revenues and have incurred operating losses. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. We do not have any sources of revenues and may not have any in the foreseeable future unless we market our rights to a drug company.
Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the period ended December 31, 2006.
Cavit has not had any revenue since its inception on April 12, 2006.
General and administrative expenses increased by 36% from $593,000 for the period ended December 31, 2006 to $805,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. General and administrative expenses consist of office expenses, wages, professional fees and write-off of impaired intangibles. The increase is primarily related to the impact of a full year of general and administrative expenses coupled with an increase in the write-off of an impaired intangible.
Other expenses of $205,187 for the period ended December 31, 2007 consist primarily of financing costs of $200,000 due to the Company's determination and treatment of the conversion feature in the notes payable and related stock options.
The Company reported a net loss of $1,010,236, or $(0.07) per share for the year ended December 31, 2007 and a net loss of $593,000, or ($0.07) per share for the period ended December 31, 2006.
We need to obtain additional capital resources from sources including equity and/or debt financings, license arrangements, grants and/or collaborative research arrangements in order to develop products and continue Cavit's business. We need to raise additional working capital in order to have sufficient working capital to finance operations. Our current burn rate is approximately $50,000 per month excluding capital expenditures. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
Research and development. We expect to make investments in research and development in order to develop and market our technology. Research and development costs will consist primarily of general and administrative and
operating expenses related to research and development activities. We will expense research and development costs as incurred. Property, plant and equipment for research and development that has an alternative future use will be capitalized and the related depreciation will be expensed as research and development costs. We expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to invest in the development of our technology.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses will consist primarily of salaries and benefits, office expense, professional services fees, and other corporate overhead costs. We anticipate increases in general and administrative expenses as we continue to develop and prepare for marketing of our technology and supplement lines.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee, contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
Our financial statements and supplementary data may be found beginning at page.
ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Colm J. King, our Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew J. Cohen, our Chief Financial Officer, (i) are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the Company and (ii) have evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report ("Evaluation Date"). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them on a timely basis to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our reports filed or submitted under the 1934 Act, except as discussed below..
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chef Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.
As of December 31, 2007, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company's management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were : (1) lack of functioning audit committee and lack of majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, and, (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2007 and communicated the matters to our management.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1) and (2) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors could result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. Management's goals are to have a functional audit committee and a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors when funds are available.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.
(b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.
In addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the 1934 Act) occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2007, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
Cavit has engaged Berkovits and Company, LLP as Cavit's new accountant to serve as the independent accounting firm responsible for auditing Cavit's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
The Company's independent accountants during 2007 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006 was Infante & Company.
(1) AUDIT FEES. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the aggregate fees billed by the Company's auditors, for services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB and for services provided in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for 2007, was $17,600. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the aggregate fees billed by the Company's auditors, for services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB and for services
provided in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for 2006, was $7,650.
(2) AUDIT-RELATED FEES. During fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, our auditors did not receive any fees for any audit-related services other than as set forth in paragraph (1) above.
(3) TAX FEES. Our auditors did not provide tax compliance, tax advice, or tax planning advice during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007.
(4) ALL OTHER FEES. None.
(5) AUDIT COMMITTEE'S PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before Principal Accountants are engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be:
* approved by our audit committee (which consists of our entire board of directors); or * entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the board of directors' responsibilities to management.
The board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
The board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our Principal Accountants and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our Principal Accountants independence.
During the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, the Company's audit committee used the following pre-approval procedures related to the selection of our independent auditors and the services they provide: Unanimous consent of all directors via a board resolution.

Notes to Financial Statements
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cavit Sciences, Inc. ("the Company") (a development stage company) as of December 31, 2007 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. Our opinion on the statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the period from April 12, 2006 (inception) to December 31, 2007 insofar as it relates to amounts for the period prior to January 1, 2007 is based on the report of other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cavit Sciences, Inc. as of December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company's dependence on outside financing, lack of sufficient working capital, and recurring losses raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cavit Sciences, Inc. (a development stage company) as of December 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from April 12, 2006 (date of inception) to December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cavit Sciences, Inc. as of December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from April 12, 2006 (date of inception) to December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital of $77,216, has incurred losses since inception totalling $592,871 and has yet to achieve profitable operations. The Company is working on various alternatives to improve the Company's financial resources which are also described in Note 1. Absent the successful completion of one of these alternatives, the Company's operating results will increasingly become uncertain. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; however, the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

CAVIT SCIENCES, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007
Note 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
Cavit Sciences, Inc. ("The Company" or "Cavit") is engaged in developing treatments of cancer, viral infections, opportunistic infections, and immune enhancers. The Company's strategy is to develop and commercialize intellectual property rights for acquisition by a drug company. Cavit is also a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of supplements lines that have been designed and formulated to enhance and improve the prostate, maintain and support cardiovascular system and beneficially affect arthritis, osteoporosis and other conditions.
Cavit was incorporated on April 12, 2006 under the laws of the State of Florida, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hard to Treat Diseases, Inc. ("Parent"), and was spun-off as a separate entity from the Parent effective May 31, 2006. The Company's registration statement on Form SB-2 became effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 16, 2006.
At December 31, 2007, the Company has negative working capital of $432,964, has incurred losses since inception totalling $1,603,107 and has yet to achieve profitable operations. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional capital to fund future operations and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not give affect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue raising funds in order to provide for the Company's capital needs, however, there are no assurances that management's plans will be attained.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates.
CASH
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company maintains the majority of its cash balances with one financial institution, in the form of demand deposits.
CAVIT SCIENCES, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007
Note 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CON'T)
DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
The Company complies with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 7 and for it's characterization of the Company as a Development Stage Enterprise.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. It is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("Statement 109"). Under Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company accounts for long-lived assets under the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 142 and 144 "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 142 and 144"). In accordance with SFAS No. 142 and 144, long-lived assets, goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows related to the long-lived assets.
LOSS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding as defined by Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." During the year ended December 31, 2007, of approximately 118,000 common shares were issued with a value of $55,603 to certain shareholders as a result of anti-dilutive clauses in their shareholder agreements with the Company that were triggered due to the issuance of shares to other shareholders.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share Based Payment," using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, it supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123 (R) addresses all forms of share-based payment awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. During the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued 104,861 and 375,000 shares, respectively, of common stock with a value of $26,500 and $19,500, respectively, to an employee of the Company. These amounts have been recorded in General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.
The cost of stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or of the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services." During the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued 488,837 and 1,810,550 shares, respectively, of common stock with a value of $142,200 and $130,844, respectively, to certain providers of outside services. These amounts have been recorded in General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 was to permit all entities to choose to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred. SFAS No. 159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with early adoption permitted for an equity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements". An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No. 159, unless it chooses early adoption. SFAS No. 159 also applies to eligible items existing at November 15, 2007 (or early adoption date). The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) EITF 00-19-2, "Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements". This FSP specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies". The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2006. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CON'T)
In September 2006 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157), which provides expanded guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for data used to value assets and liabilities, and requires additional disclosures about the extent to which a company measures assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. Implementation of SFAS 157 is required on December 1, 2007. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109" (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. FIN 48 provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. If an uncertain tax position meets the "more-likely-than-not" threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority, is recorded. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.

Note 3 INCOME TAXES
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for income tax reporting purposes of approximately $1,600,000 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2026. Current tax laws limits the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited. No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements, because the Company believes there is a 50% or greater chance the carryforwards will expire unused. Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the loss carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.

Note 6 INTANGIBLE ASSET
On December 28, 2007, the Company acquired formulas, tests and packaging intellectual property related to a supplement line from the Daycon Investors Associates, Inc., Americare Nutritional Division (Daycon). The company issued a note in the amount of $250,000 as payment for the intellectual property.
Under SFAS 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company conducted an impairment test of the above mentioned supplement line. SFAS 144 states that if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is evaluated and found not to be recoverable, then an impairment loss must be recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the asset's fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices in active markets, when available. If market prices in active markets are not readily determinable, the Company's estimated fair value is based on the best information available such as market prices for similar assets or using valuation techniques such as the expected present value of future cash flows as set forth in ASB Concepts Statement 7.
The Company ultimately concluded that the amount assigned to this asset would be expensed as impaired since it is a unique intellectual property for which a fair market value is not easily determinable and for which a valid calculation of expected present value of future cash flows cannot be made. See write-off of impaired intangible in the Statements of Operations.

Note 7 PATENT ACQUISITION
On May 31, 2006, the Company acquired intellectual property rights from its former Parent, consisting of three patent applications. The Company paid $145,459 by issuing 8,475,000 shares of its common stock at a value of $.017 per share. The value paid for such intellectual property consisted of $56,997 in legal fees and $88,462 of purchased research and development costs ("R&D"). The Company did not pay for the former Parent's overhead expenses related to R&D. Such costs amounted to $47,060 for the period from January 1, 2004 to May 31, 2006 when the Parent began to expend resources to develop such intellectual property rights.
On July 7, 2006, the Company entered into an assignment agreement whereby it acquired a portion of the rights to a patent application entitled, "Methods and Compositions for Treatment of Viral Infections".
As required by SFAS 142, the Company conducted an impairment test of its patent application rights to measure their fair value (as defined by SFAS 142). At December 31, 2006, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $86,997 which was primarily due to the fact that such patents are not currently producing revenues or cash flows. The book value of the patent application rights does not reflect the future potential of our patents as the patent rights are still in the application phase.

Note 10 CONVERTIBLE DEBT
During the year, the Company issued various convertible notes payable amounting to $200,000. These convertible notes matured at various times within six months from date of issuance, had an interest rate of 7% and included a beneficial conversion feature which allowed the holder to convert the notes to common stock at a conversion price of $0.08 per share. Along with these convertible notes, the Company also issued options expiring three years from date of issuance which allow the holders to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock at 80% of the average price for the five trading days prior to the date of exercise. The notes were all converted into stock on December 16, 2007.
Convertible debt with beneficial conversion features, whereby the conversion feature is "in the money," are accounted for in accordance with guidance supplied by Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 98-5 "Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios" and EITF No. 00-27 "Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments." The relative fair value of the beneficial conversion feature and related options was recorded as a discount against the convertible notes up to the amount received upon the issuance of the notes and has been amortized into operations through the date of conversion.
The amortization related to the above discounts has been reflected in financing costs in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.
