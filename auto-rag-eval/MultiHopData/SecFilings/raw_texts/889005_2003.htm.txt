ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
Properties - Principal Areas of Operations
Our operations are concentrated in four divisions: Northern, Western, Southern and Gulf of Mexico. We operate approximately 77% of the net present value of our reserves. We finance our exploitation, exploration and acquisition activities through cash flows from operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other financing activities. Set forth below is summary information concerning average daily production during the fourth quarter of 2003, estimated reserves and a pre-tax SEC net present value of estimated proved reserves discounted at 10%, as of December 31, 2003 in our divisions.
(1)
Mmbbls converted to Bcfe at a six to one conversion.
(2)
Excludes value attributable to the gathering and compression assets of Westport Field Services, LLC, one of our subsidiaries.
(3)
Includes production from the South Texas Acquisition from December 19, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
Northern Division
The Northern Division conducts operations in the Rocky Mountain region and primarily includes the Williston, Powder River, Big Horn, Wind River and Greater Green River Basins. The division represented approximately 17% of our net present value of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, and contributed approximately 22% of our fourth quarter 2003 net production. We have interests in 506,868 developed and 1,027,359 undeveloped gross acres and in 2,069 gross (approximately 730 net) producing wells in this division.
Williston Basin. We continue to focus our activities on horizontal field extensions and growth of secondary recovery projects. Our most active project continues to be the Wiley field. We operate this waterflood with a 54% working interest. In 2000, we initiated a horizontal drilling program and through December 31, 2003 have drilled 48 wells, all of which were successful. In addition to the horizontal drilling, we increased water injection capacity to expand our waterflood program. As a result of this activity, average gross daily production in this field has increased from approximately 600 bbl/d in April 2000 to over 2,700 bbl/d during the fourth quarter 2003. Over the next 12 months, we plan to drill eight to 12 additional wells in the Wiley field while continuing to increase water injection capacity. In addition to our work in the Wiley field we drilled 10 operated horizontal wells, nine of which were successful, in our Horse Creek, TR, Tree Top and Bear Creek fields. In 2004, we plan to drill horizontal development wells in our Horse Creek, TR, Lone Butte and Putnam fields.
Greater Green River Basin. We have interests in approximately 397,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Greater Green River Basin. Over the next 12 to 24 months we expect to drill five to ten exploration wells in this basin. One of our primary operating areas within the basin is the Moxa Arch Complex. Production from Moxa Arch wells tends to be long-lived, with the potential for greater than a 25 year reserve life. We drilled 14 wells in the Moxa Arch in 2003, 13 of which were successful. Our net
production in fourth quarter of 2003 from the Moxa Arch averaged 21.7 Mmcfe/d. We plan to drill 35 to 40 development wells in the Moxa Arch in 2004.
Big Horn Basin. The Gooseberry field is our most significant property in the Big Horn Basin. We own a 100% working interest (nearly 90% net revenue interest) in this field, which consists of two waterflood units. Since acquiring the field in February 1995, we have doubled gross production from 535 bbl/d to approximately 1,080 bbl/d in December 2003. In 2003 we drilled four development wells and one water source well, all of which were successful. We currently have interests in over 186,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Big Horn Basin.
Coalbed Methane. Since initiating our coalbed methane drilling in the Powder River Basin in 2000, we have participated in 301 wells through December 31, 2003, 297 of which have been successful. We operate 160 of these wells. In 2003 we initiated an eight well development project in the Big George coal within the House Creek field. Net coalbed methane production in the Powder River Basin averaged approximately 13.4 Mmcf/d in fourth quarter 2003. In 2003 we initiated three additional coalbed methane projects, one each in the Greater Green River Basin, the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah and the Raton Basin of southeastern Colorado. In the Greater Green River Basin we participated in one well in the Almond coal. In the Uinta Basin we drilled nine wells and established production of approximately 1.3 Mmcf/d (net) from the Navajo coal. In the Raton Basin we began operations in early January 2004 and drilled our first three wells in the Vermejo coal. Our coalbed methane acreage position covers over 58,000 gross developed acres in the Powder River Basin, over 28,500 gross undeveloped acres in the Uinta Basin and approximately 17,300 gross undeveloped acres in the Raton Basin. In 2004 we plan to drill 15 to 20 WyoDak and 10 to 16 Big George wells in the Powder River Basin, five to 10 wells in the Greater Green River Basin, 10 to 15 wells in the Uinta Basin and 10 to 15 wells in the Raton Basin.
Western Division
The Western Division conducts operations in the Greater Natural Buttes area of Uintah County, Utah. We acquired these properties in December 2002, which were producing approximately 68 Mmcfe/d net to us at the time of acquisition. We have increased net production to an average of 84 Mmcfe/d during the fourth quarter of 2003, representing 18% of our total net production. This division contributed approximately 25% of our net present value of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003. We have interests in 191,612 developed and 79,068 undeveloped gross acres and in 1,081 gross (approximately 831 net) producing wells in this division.
The Natural Buttes unit has undergone a series of downspacings from the original 320 acres per well spacing to a current spacing of 40 acres per well. Unit wells are characterized by established production profiles and long reserve lives. Producing horizons range from 3,000 to 13,000 feet. Historically production has been primarily from the Wasatch formation. In 2003, our drilling program focused on developing the Mesa Verde potential within and adjacent to the Natural Buttes unit. Production from this formation is often commingled with the Wasatch. Through our high working interest and significant level of operations we can control drilling, completion and production of the majority of our wells. In 2003 we drilled 83 wells, all of which were successful and we expect to drill 95 to 105 wells in this area in 2004.
Southern Division
The Southern Division conducts operations in the onshore Gulf Coast, Permian Basin and Mid-Continent regions. This division represented 43% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, and contributed 34% of our fourth quarter 2003 net production. We have interests in 582,160 developed and 182,689 undeveloped gross acres and in 3,436 gross (approximately 1,667 net) producing wells in this division.
Onshore Gulf Coast. Our Gulf Coast operations include producing trends in Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast.
•
Southeast Texas Properties. We acquired our Southeast Texas properties in September 2002, which are focused in the Yegua, Frio, Vicksburg and Hackberry Trends. We maintained an active drilling program in this area during 2003, drilling two development wells, both of which were successful, and ten exploration wells, four of which were successful. Net production has increased from 28 Mmcfe/d at the time of acquisition to an average of 40.3 Mmcfe/d in the fourth quarter of 2003. We expect to drill 12 to 15 exploration prospects over the next 12 to 24 months.
•
South Texas Properties. We acquired these properties in December 2003. At December 31, 2003 the proved reserves were estimated at 208 Bcfe, of which 97% is natural gas. These assets complement a growing core area for the company in South Texas and produce from the Lobo, Frio, Vicksburg and Wilcox Trends. The properties are currently producing at approximately 62.2 Mmcfe/d (net). In January 2004, the Company initiated a four-rig drilling program. We expect to spend approximately $50 million in capital during 2004 and plan to drill 30 to 35 development wells and five to 10 exploration wells in this area during the year. The three largest fields are Southwest Speaks, Cage Ranch and JC Martin.
•
Southwest Speaks Field. The Southwest Speaks field in Lavaca County, Texas produces from the Frio, Yegua and Wilcox formations at depths ranging from 3,300 to 15,000 feet. The field currently produces approximately 11.9 Mmcfe/d (net). We expect to drill five to seven development wells and one exploration well in this field during 2004.
•
Cage Ranch Field. The Cage Ranch field in Brooks County, Texas produces from the Frio and Vicksburg formations at depths ranging from 6,500 to 10,500 feet. The field currently produces approximately 15.0 Mmcfe/d (net). We expect to drill five to eight development wells and one exploration well in 2004.
•
JC Martin Field. The JC Martin field in Zapata County, Texas produces from the Lobo formation at depths ranging from 8,500 to 10,000 feet. The field currently produces approximately 10.3 Mmcfe/d (net). We expect to drill eight to ten development wells in this field during 2004.
•
Elm Grove Field. We maintained an active development drilling program in the Elm Grove field in 2003 by drilling 39 wells, 38 of which were successful. Net production averaged approximately 18.9 Mmcfe/d in fourth quarter 2003. In 2004 we expect to drill 30 to 35 development wells in this field.
•
North Louisiana Field Complex. Development drilling in this four-field complex continues to be active. In 2003 we drilled 20 wells, all of which were successful. Net fourth quarter 2003 production averaged 7.5 Mmcfe/d. We anticipate drilling between 15 and 25 development wells in this region in each of the next two years.
Permian Basin. Our principal Permian Basin activity continues to be focused on development of the Andrews unit and the Shafter Lake San Andres unit waterfloods.
•
Andrews Unit. The Andrews unit waterflood produces from the Wolfcamp/ Penn formation at approximately 8,600 feet. We have a 98.6% working interest in this 3,230-acre unit. During 2003 we continued expanding the waterflood program by drilling additional wells, converting wells to injectors and performing workovers on existing wells. As a result, gross production continues to increase from an 855 bbl/d average in 2000 to an average of nearly 1,300 bbl/d in the fourth quarter of 2003. We believe that production from this unit can be further enhanced with the use of CO2 flooding or other tertiary recovery methods.
•
Shafter Lake San Andres Unit. The Shafter Lake San Andres unit is a 12,880-acre unit that produces from the Grayburg and San Andres formations at a depth of approximately 4,500 feet. We have an 81.4% working interest in this secondary recovery unit. In 2003, we drilled 10 wells on
10-acre spacing and plan to drill 10 to 15 additional 10-acre wells in 2004. The unit produced an average of 685 gross bbl/d in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Mid-Continent. Our Mid-Continent operations are currently focused in Oklahoma and Kansas. Oil production is concentrated in our operated waterfloods in Oklahoma, while natural gas production is primarily from third party operated wells in Oklahoma and in our operated wells in Kansas.
Gulf of Mexico Division
The Gulf of Mexico Division represented 15% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, and contributed 26% of our fourth quarter 2003 net production. As of December 31, 2003, we have interests in 329,229 developed and 286,793 undeveloped gross acres and in 157 gross (approximately 45 net) producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition to a production base with numerous exploitation opportunities within our developed acreage, the Gulf of Mexico provides us with moderate-risk exploration targets. We drilled 11 exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2003, four of which were successful, and two development wells , both of which were successful. We have under license 3-D seismic data covering approximately 30,470 square miles (approximately 3,900 blocks) and 2-D seismic data covering 150,000 linear miles within the Gulf of Mexico. In the third quarter of 2003 we entered into an exploration agreement with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of ChevronTexaco). Under this agreement the parties have identified nine prospects, and expect to identify additional prospects over the next two years. We plan to participate for 45% of the interest held by Chevron U.S.A. Two unsuccessful wells were drilled in 2003.
West Cameron Blocks 180/198. The West Cameron Blocks 180/198 complex is located 30 miles offshore in 52 feet of water. In 2003 we commenced production on one 2002 development well and drilled one unsuccessful exploration well. The complex has produced approximately 1.7 Tcf of natural gas and 10 Mmbbl of oil from over 20 separate producing zones since its discovery. In fourth quarter 2003, the field produced 36.4 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
South Timbalier Block 316. The South Timbalier Block 316 is located approximately 66 miles offshore in 400 feet of water, we discovered this field in the fourth quarter of 2001 and commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2003. We operate the field with a 40% working interest. In early February 2004 the field produced approximately 47 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
High Island Block 197. This field is located approximately 28 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001. We have a 25% non-operated working interest in the field. During 2003, four additional wells were drilled, following the discovery well, three of which were successful. The field commenced production in May 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2003 the field averaged 11.3 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
Ship Shoal Block 94. Ship Shoal Block 94 is located approximately 15 miles offshore in 20 feet of water. We discovered this field in the first quarter of 2003 and operate the field with a 60% working interest. The field commenced production in the third quarter of 2003 and averaged 8.9 Mmcfe/d net to our interest in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Galveston Block 352. We drilled a successful exploratory well in the spring of 2002 and put the well on production in August of that year. We drilled a second well in 2003, which commenced production in the third quarter. We operate the wells with a 67% working interest. In the fourth quarter of 2003 the field averaged 5.4 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
West Cameron Block 73. This field is located approximately 12 miles offshore in 33 feet of water and was discovered in the second quarter of 2003. We have a 30% non-operated working interest in the field. The field commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2003 and is currently producing 4.1 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
High Island Block 84. This field is located approximately 23 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001. We drilled three development wells in the block during 2002.
We operate this field with an approximate 51.6% working interest. Production commenced from the field in June and we added a fourth well in late 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003 the field averaged 3.2 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
Green Canyon Block 640. We have a 3.7% overriding royalty interest in the Green Canyon Block 640, part of the 2002 Tahiti discovery drilled by ChevronTexaco. Facility design and development is ongoing. A production test is expected in 2004.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated:
(1)
The difference in the net present value from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 208 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the South Texas Acquisition, (ii) the addition of 188 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions, (iii) the increase in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $31.23 to $32.55 per bbl of oil and from $4.58 to $5.83 per Mmbtu of natural gas) and (iv) the inclusion of a portion of our producing well overhead associated with general corporate expenses related to operated oil and natural gas producing activities.
(2)
The difference in net present value from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 722.7 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the Williston Basin, Southeast Texas and Utah acquisitions in 2002, (ii) the addition of 58 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions and (iii) the increase in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $19.78 to $31.23 per bbl of oil and from $2.72 to $4.58 per Mmbtu of natural gas).
(3)
The standardized measure is the value of the future after-tax net revenues discounted at 10%. The difference between the net present value and the standardized measure is the effect of income taxes discounted at 10%.
Estimated quantities of our oil and gas reserves and the net present value of such reserves as of December 31, 2003 are based upon reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L. P., Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and our engineering staff. The Ryder Scott report covered approximately 71% of the total net present value of our proved reserves. The Netherland Sewell report covered the South Texas properties we acquired in December 2003, comprising approximately 16% of the total net present value of estimated proved reserves and the internally generated report covered the remaining 13% of the net present value of such reserves. At December 31, 2002 the Ryder Scott reports covered 81% of the total net present value of estimates of total proved reserves, preparing 58% and auditing 23%. The internally generated report covered the remaining 19% of the net present value of estimated proved reserves. At December 31, 2001 Ryder Scott audited 87% of the total net present value of estimates of total proved reserves and the remaining 13% of net present value of the reserves was unaudited.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of exploitation expenditures. The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly, and estimates of other engineers might differ materially from those shown above. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be revised from time to time and may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The present value shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is mandated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties that we operate, expenses include a portion of our producing well overhead associated with general corporate expenses related to operated oil and natural gas activities. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things, general and administrative costs and interest expense.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated:
Producing Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2003, relating to the producing wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. We also held royalty interests in 1,904 producing wells as of that date. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
Acreage
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2003, relating to acreage held by us. Developed acreage is assigned to producing wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage held under lease, permit, contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for exploitation or exploratory drilling. The term “gross acres” refers to the total number of acres in which we own a working interest. The term “net acres” refers to gross acres multiplied by our fractional working interest therein.
The total net undeveloped acres expiring in 2004, 2005 and 2006 are 123,409, 168,764 and 82,722, respectively.
Drilling Results
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells drilled during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they generate a reasonable rate of return.
As of December 31, 2003, nine additional exploration and 31 development wells were in progress.
