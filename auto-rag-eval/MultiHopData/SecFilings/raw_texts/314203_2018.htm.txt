ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We classify our mineral properties into reportable segments consistent with the manner in which they are grouped in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15, Operating Segment Reporting and subdivide them within each segment by their respective stage of development: “production properties”, “advanced-stage properties” and “exploration properties”. Advanced-stage properties consist of properties for which advanced studies and reports have been completed indicating the presence of economically mineable mineralized material or in some cases, proven and probable reserves, and for which we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining the required permitting. Our designation of certain properties as “production properties” or “advanced-stage properties” should not suggest that we have proven or probable reserves at those properties as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7.
The location of our significant production, advanced-stage and exploration properties is described below:
SEGMENT: MEXICO
The following map depicts the location of our major properties included in the Mexico segment, of which the El Gallo Project (formerly “El Gallo 1” or “El Gallo Mine”) and the advanced-stage Fenix Project are described in the sections below:

Production Properties
El Gallo Project (formerly “El Gallo 1” or “El Gallo Mine”), Mexico (100% owned)
For detailed information on the El Gallo Project production statistics and financial results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview and History
We own 100% of the El Gallo Project. The El Gallo Project was the open-pit gold mine and heap leach operation originally known as the Magistral mine. We operated the mine from September 2012 to June 2018, when we ceased active mining. Present activities are limited to residual leaching production that will continue until the end of 2020, as part of the closure and reclamation requirements.
The El Gallo Project consists of 8 sq miles (20 sq km) of concessions. Concession titles are granted under Mexican mining law. Mining concessions are subject to annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi-annual basis in accordance with Mexican law. An annual lease agreement for surface access to the El Gallo Project is currently in place.
Location and Access
The El Gallo Project and the surrounding properties are in northwestern Mexico in the western foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, within the State of Sinaloa in the Mocorito Municipality, approximately 60 miles (100 km) by air northwest of Culiacan, the Sinaloa State capital city. The concessions are located approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) by road from the town of Mocorito. Access is by paved or well maintained, two-way dirt roads.
Facilities and Infrastructure
The El Gallo Project property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads, water supply and high-speed internet access. There is a truck shop, a warehouse, a fuel depot, core logging facilities, an explosives magazine, heap leach pads, process ponds, an assay laboratory, a three stage crushing plant, an ADR process plant with a sulfidation-acidification recovery (“SAR”) circuit added in the first quarter of 2018 and an administrative office. The laboratory is equipped to process all assay samples from the mine, core, chips and soil. The metallurgical lab is capable of determining cyanide leaching amenability and gold and silver recoveries of mineralized material amenable to cyanide leaching.
Advanced-Stage Properties
Fenix Project, Mexico (100% owned)
Overview and History
Five mineralized material areas located inside of our property position have been considered for the Fenix Project and are the basis of the resource estimate reported in the new Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) filed on July 9, 2018.
The Fenix Project contemplates a two-phase development process. Phase 1 includes the reprocessing of material on the gold heap leach pad at the existing El Gallo Project, and Phase 2 includes the processing of open pit gold and silver mineralization from El Gallo Silver, Palmarito, El Encuentro and Carrisalejo.
The process plant would use conventional and proven mineral processing and precious metals recovery technologies. Phase 1 would have a throughput rate of 5,000 tonnes per day (tpd). During Phase 2 fresh mineralized material from the higher grade silver deposits (El Gallo Silver primarily) would only be processed at a maximum of 3,250 tpd.
Tailings produced during the operation would be stored in a mined-out open pit at the El Gallo Project. As part of this process, tailings deposition would include a delivery system designed to maximize tailings consolidation and water recovery.
During 2019, we expect to complete the feasibility study, and work towards obtaining regulatory approval for a permit amendment to allow for in-pit tailings storage, which is a key feature of the proposed project implementation. A decision to pursue the project has not yet been made.
Access and Location
The Fenix Project is located adjacent to the El Gallo Project and is similarly accessible.
Facilities and Infrastructure
The El Gallo Project infrastructure is used to support current work on the Fenix Project.
In addition, the local power grid is situated approximately 15 km from the Fenix Project, and a new overhead power line would need to be installed to supply grid power to the Fenix Project.
SEGMENT: CANADA
The following map depicts the location of our major properties forming the Canada segment. The segment consists of the Black Fox Mine (which includes Black Fox North, Grey Fox, Froome and Tamarack properties) and the Black Fox Stock Mill (which includes Stock Mill and other exploration projects).

Production Properties
Black Fox Mine and Stock Mill, Canada (100% owned)
For detailed information on the Black Fox Mine production statistics and financial results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview and History
The Black Fox Mine refers to the current mining operation and is an underground gold mine. Modern exploration activities at the Black Fox Mine (formerly the Glimmer Mine) started in the late 1990’s, with production initiated by Exall Resources Limited, which operated the mine from 1997 to 2001. Renamed the Black Fox Mine in 2002, there was no gold production until Brigus Gold Corporation (“Brigus”) restarted the mine in early 2009. Primero Mining Corp. (“Primero”) acquired Brigus on March 5, 2014. During the period between 2014 and 2016, the mine produced 151,000 ounces of gold. We acquired the property on October 3, 2017 and continued the commercial operations.
The Black Fox Mine contains 30 mining right PIN’s and 50 unpatented claims totaling 10 sq miles (25 sq km) of mining land. The complex also includes 6 sq miles (16 sq km) of surface land. All land parcels are located within Beatty and Hislop townships in the municipality of Black-River Matheson.
Location and Access
The Black Fox Mine is located 7 miles (11 km) east of Matheson, Ontario, on Highway 101 East. Matheson, in turn, is located approximately 45 miles (72 km) from Timmins, which has a commercial airport. Timmins is approximately 342 miles (550 km) by air north of Toronto. Access to the mine is either by paved or well maintained, two-way, dirt roads.
The Black Fox Stock Mill is located approximately 17 miles (27 km) from the Black Fox mine. Mineralized material is shipped to the mill from the Black Fox mine by truck.
Geology and Mineralization
The Black Fox Mine is located within the Abitibi greenstone belt. Gold mineralization at the Black Fox Mine occurs in several different geological environments within the main ankerite alteration zone, and generally occurs as: (1) Free gold associated with shallow dipping quartz veins and stockworks in green carbonate and ankerite-altered ultramafic rocks; (2) Gold-bearing pyrite; (3) Gold associated with fine-grained pyrite and (4) Free gold in steeply dipping sigmoidal quartz veins.
Facilities and Infrastructure
The Black Fox Mine property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads, water supply and high-speed internet access. There are seven fully-serviced modular buildings which support various functions of the underground mine. There is also a maintenance shop, warehouse, compressed air plant, backfill plant and water management facilities. Mineralized material from the Black Fox mine is transported to, and processed at, the Black Fox Stock Mill, which has a nominal processing capacity of 2,500 tpd.
The primary water supply for the Black Fox Mine comes from an on-site fresh water well and water produced from dewatering activities. Current water supplies are adequate to sustain current and planned future operations.
The Black Fox Stock Mill property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads, water supply and high-speed internet access. There are also two buildings that support security and administration of the Mill. There is an assay lab and several other buildings to support operations and milling, including a hoist house, warehouse and maintenance shop, mine dry building, crusher and conveyor systems and the mill building itself. The site also houses various support structures including storage and generator buildings.
Metal Streaming Agreement
We are obligated to sell 8% of current and future gold production from the Black Fox mine and 6.3% from the adjoining Pike River property (Black Fox Extension) to Sandstorm Gold Limited (“Sandstorm”) at the lesser of market price or $531 per oz (with inflation adjustments of up to 2% per year) until 2090. We assumed this obligation in connection with our acquisition of the Black Fox mine in 2017 and did not receive the proceeds from the sale of the stream.
Advanced-Stage Properties
Grey Fox, Canada (100% owned)
The Grey Fox project is located 2.2 miles (3.5 km) south of Black Fox Mine, and is directly adjacent to Kirkland Lake Gold’s Hislop mine. Access is either by paved or well maintained, two-way, dirt roads.
An internal feasibility-level study was completed on the Grey Fox project in early 2015 by Primero, which recommended further development of the deposit. Further advanced project work continued until 2016, when Primero ceased all non-essential expenditures. A final decision to proceed with development has not been made and would be dependent on gold price expectations and overall project economics. We continue examining alternatives to reduce capital and operating costs.
Froome and Tamarack, Canada (100% Owned)
The Froome deposit is located 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of the Black Fox Mine, whereas the Tamarack deposit is located 0.2 miles (0.3 km) east of the Black Fox Mine. Both deposits are accessible by paved road.

The following map depicts the location of our major properties in the USA segment, including the Gold Bar project currently under construction and exploration properties which are fully owned by us or subject to joint venture agreements:
The following table summarizes the land position of our properties in Nevada as of December 31, 2018:
Advanced-Stage Properties
Gold Bar Project, Nevada (100% owned)
Overview and History
Gold Bar is located primarily on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency published a Notice of Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) in the Federal Register. After the required review period, the Company received the signed Record of Decision (“ROD”) on the final EIS on November 8, 2017.
The Gold Bar Project is an open pit oxide gold mine with a heap leach pad and gold recovery plant. Project Construction commenced in November 2017 following receipt of the signed ROD.
The property is located within the Battle Mountain-Eureka-Cortez gold trend in Eureka County, central Nevada. The property was previously mined from 1987 to 1994 by Atlas Precious Metals Inc.
On February 15, 2018, we announced the results of an updated Feasibility Study (“FS”). The complete FS is available electronically at our website at www.mcewenmining.com.
Location and Access
The Gold Bar Project is in the Roberts Creek Mountains, in Eureka County, Nevada, approximately 30 miles (48 km) northwest of the town of Eureka, Nevada, primarily in Township 22 North, Range 50 East (N39°48’16.5”; W116°21’09.65”). The project site is accessed by traveling west on US Highway 50 from Eureka, then north on the Three Bars Road, a gravel, all-weather road maintained by Eureka County. The project area is approximately 15 miles (24 km) from the end of Three Bars Road, and is accessed through unimproved dirt roads that are maintained by the company.
Geology and Mineralization
The project is located in the Battle Mountain-Eureka mineral belt in a large window of lower-plate carbonate rocks surrounded by upper-plate rocks. The lower-plate carbonates consist of an east-dipping section of Silurian Lone Mountain Dolomite, Devonian McColley Canyon Formation, Devonian Denay Formation, and Devonian Devils Gate Limestone (from oldest to youngest). Gold mineralization is hosted primarily in the Bartine Member of the McColley Canyon Formation, which consists of carbonate wackestones and packstones which are approximately 250 to 380 feet thick. Minor amounts of mineralization are found in the underlying dolomitic limestone Kobeh Member of the McColley Canyon Formation where it is adjacent to apparent feeder structures. The area where the project is located has “Carlin-Type” sediment-hosted gold mineralization characteristics with typical associated alteration (decalcification, silicification).
Facilities and Infrastructure
Construction of the Gold Bar site facilities and infrastructure was completed by year-end. These facilities include mine administration building, process plant support building, on-site power generation plant, and all required water supply equipment and transfer systems. Facilities are commissioned and occupied by operations team.
Gold Bar Project construction began in November 2017. Key completed activities in 2018 include:
·
Engineering and procurement of all materials and capital equipment;
·
Installation of crushing, conveying, and stacking system;
·
Heap leach pad;
·
Process and event ponds;
·
On-site power generation plant and transmission lines;
·
Required water, natural gas, and related supply utilities;
·
Substantial completion of gold process plant and refinery circuit.
Exploration Activities
In December 2017 and through early 2018, a series of near pit limit exploration holes were drilled at the Gold Bar project. We plan to continue with this type of exploration program in 2019.
Exploration Properties
Tonkin property (100% owned)
The Tonkin property represents our second largest holding within the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend in Eureka County, Nevada with approximately 45 sq. miles (116 sq. km). The Tonkin property consists of the Tonkin Springs deposit and the previously operating Tonkin mine.
From 1985 through 1989, the Tonkin mine produced approximately 30,000 ounces of gold utilizing an oxide heap leach and a separate ball mill involving bio oxidation to treat refractory sulphide mineralized material. Due to cost escalation and recovery issues, the operation was shut down. The mine site is currently on care-and-maintenance and we continue to advance the reclamation program. We also continue evaluation work with respect to the Tonkin Springs deposit.
SEGMENT: LOS AZULES
Exploration Properties
The following map depicts the location of our major exploration properties in the Los Azules segment in two distinct exploration projects at Los Azules and Chonchones, in the province of San Juan in Argentina. Los Azules is the more advanced and significant project at this time.
The following table summarizes the land position related to Los Azules segment as of December 31, 2018:
Los Azules Copper Project, Argentina (100% owned)
Overview and History
The Los Azules copper project is an advanced-stage porphyry copper exploration project located in the cordilleran region in the province of San Juan, Argentina near the border with Chile. In 1994, Minera Andes acquired lands in the southern portion of the Los Azules area. Over the years there was additional exploration done by Minera Andes and other companies who owned adjacent properties around Los Azules. We acquired Minera Andes in January 2012.
In 2019, we will be completing environmental studies to gather the requested information to prepare the Environmental Impact Assessment for the next development phase. Previous activities performed were mainly technical site investigations and environmental base line monitoring work, to advance permitting efforts.
Location and Access
The project is located at approximately 31o 13’30” South latitude and 70o 13’50” West longitude and about 4 miles (6 km) east of the Chile-Argentina border. It is accessible by unimproved dirt roads with seasonal closures in winter. The elevation at the site ranges between 11,500 feet to 14,750 feet (3,500 meters to 4,200 meters) above sea level.
Geology and Mineralization
The deposit is located within a copper porphyry belt that is host to some of the world’s largest copper mines. The upper part of the system consists of a barren leached cap, which is underlain by a high-grade secondary enrichment blanket. Primary mineralization below the secondary enrichment zone has been intersected in drilling up to a depth of more than 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) below surface.
Exploration Activities
Drilling conditions in the area are difficult, especially due to the presence of highly faulted zones and areas of loose surface scree or talus. Due to snow conditions on two mountain passes on the access road to the site, seasonal exploration typically commences in December and extends into late April or early May. Drilling programs have been undertaken at Los Azules between 1998 and 2014 and in 2017 by four different mineral exploration companies: Battle Mountain Gold (now Newmont Mining Inc.), Mount Isa Mines S.A. (now Glencore Plc.), Minera Andes and McEwen Mining. Drilling, including early reverse circulation programs, focused initially on gold exploration and subsequently on diamond drilling for porphyry style copper mineralization. Drilling activities have been minimal since 2013 as we have focused on baseline studies regarding flora, fauna, water quality and other environmental compliance matters.
Facilities and Infrastructure
There are currently limited facilities or infrastructure located at the project site which mainly includes portable camp structures and drill platforms.
ITEM 3.
