ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company's Common Stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol "SAVW.OB." The market for the Company's Common Stock is limited, volatile and sporadic and the price of the Company's Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results, news announcements, trading volume, sales of Common Stock by officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Company, general market trends, changes in the supply and demand for the Company's shares, and other factors.
The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for each quarter relating to the Company's Common Stock for the last two fiscal years. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, markdown, or commissions, and may not reflect actual transactions.
High Low ------ ------- Fiscal 2009 First Quarter (2) $ .130 $ .0100 Second Quarter (1) $ .020 $ .0021 Third Quarter (1) $ .015 $ .0023 Fourth Quarter (1) $ .012 $ .0024
Fiscal 2010 First Quarter (2) $ .012 $ .0035 Second Quarter (1) $ .04 $ .0035 Third Quarter (1) $ .089 $ .0036 Fourth Quarter (1) $ .10 $ .0125
---------- (1) This represents the closing bid information for the stock on the Pink Sheets. The bid and ask quotations represent prices between dealers and do not include retail markup, markdown or commission. They do not represent actual transactions and have not been adjusted for stock dividends or splits. (2) This represents the closing price for the stock on the Pink Sheets.
Our common stock is considered a "penny stock." The application of the "penny stock" rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. The Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093 dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
HOLDERS
As of April 13, 2011 there were approximately 162 shareholders of record of the Company's Common Stock.
DIVIDENDS
The Company has not declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock or preferred stock during the last two fiscal years and does not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future. There are no material restrictions limiting or that are likely to limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on its outstanding securities.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
CAUTIONARY FORWARD - LOOKING STATEMENT
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes.
Certain matters discussed herein may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:
* the volatile and competitive nature of our industry, * the uncertainties surrounding the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete, * the uncertainties surrounding technological change of the industry, * our dependence on its intellectual property rights, * the success of marketing efforts by third parties, * the changing demands of customers and * the arrangements with present and future customers and third parties.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results of current and future operations may vary materially from those anticipated. See also the disclosures under "Cautionary Statement" following the Table of Contents in this Annual Report.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company has not generated any significant revenues since its inception on October 20,2006.
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009
The Company's operations for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 consist of General and administrative expenses incurred in the amount of $274,243 and $0, and professional fees amounting to $453,273 and $410,000, respectively.
FOR THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER 20, 2006 (INCEPTION) TO December 31, 2010.
Expenses from inception consist of professional fees of $1,685.873 and general and administrative expenses consisting of organization and related expenses of $291,654 and $36,011,369 related to stock based compensation.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have financed our operations from inception to date through the sale of common stock, amounting to $315,000, and through the issuance of a $50,000 loan payable.
We had minimal cash on hand as of December 31, 2010 and a working capital deficiency of $2,060,161 We will continue to need additional cash during the following twelve months and these needs will coincide with the cash demands resulting from implementing our business plan and remaining current with our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital as required, or obtain the capital on acceptable terms and conditions.
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not begun generating revenue, is considered a development stage company, has experienced recurring net operating losses and had a net loss of $2,824,137 for the year ended December 31, 2010. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations.

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2010, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company's internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permits us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS

Dated: April 15, 2011 /s/ Michael Haug ------------------------------------------ By: Michael Haug Its: Chief Executive Officer
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of SavWatt USA, Inc. (f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. (A Development Stage Company):
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) and subsidiary as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the period from inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the period from inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations. These issues raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Ludvik Capital, Inc. (hereinafter "the Company") was incorporated on October 20, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of becoming a successor corporation by merger with Patriot Advisors, Inc. and Templar Corporation, pursuant to a plan of reorganization and merger approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maine in Case No. 04-20328 whereby Ludvik Capital, Inc is the continuing entity.
The Company's business plan consisted of investing in public and private companies, providing long term equity and debt investment capital to fund growth and acquisitions and recapitalizations of small and middle market companies in a variety of industries primarily located in the United States.
Since inception, the Company has had minimal operations and no revenues earned.
On April 5, 2010, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to SavWatt USA, Inc.
SavWatt USA, Inc. ("SavWatt") business plan is to capitalize on the largely unaddressed commercial and consumer market for energy-efficient LED lighting by investing in product and corporate marketing. With public relations and advertising throughout the media, a recognized, popular consumer LED brand will be cultivated, spearheading and establishing a leading market share in the growing energy-efficient bulb sector during the next three to five years. SavWatt has the exclusive marketing rights in the United States to sell LED street lighting for Unilumin (www.unilumin.com).
The Company is a development stage enterprise.
The Company's year end is December 31.
The Company's corporate headquarters were originally located in Virginia but are currently located in Baltimore MD.
GOING CONCERN AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $2,824,137 for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the Company has incurred a net loss from inception (October 20, 2006) through December 31, 2010 and accumulated deficit amounting to $39,203,264. Since its inception, the Company has not generated any revenues and has minimal cash resources.
These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management's efforts have been directed towards the development and implementation of a plan to generate sufficient revenues to cover all of its present and future costs and expenses.
Management is taking steps to address this situation. The Company has determined that it cannot continue with its business operations as outlined in its original business plan because of a lack of financial resources; therefore, management has redirected their focus towards identifying and pursuing options regarding the development of a new business plan and direction. The Company intends to explore various business opportunities that have the potential to generate positive revenue, profits and cash flow in order to financially accommodate the costs of being a publicly held company. The Company is in the process of raising capital by implementing its business plan in Led lighting and expects to generate sufficient revenue by the fourth quarter of 2011 with a positive cash flow. Until then, the Company the Company will not have the required capital resources or credit lines available that are sufficient to fund operations.
SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010
The Company has minimal operating costs and expenses at the present time due to its limited business activities. The Company, however, will be required to raise additional capital over the next twelve months to meet its current administrative expenses, and it may do so in connection with or in anticipation of possible acquisition transactions. This financing may take the form of additional sales of its equity securities and/or loans from its directors. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available, if required, or on terms favorable to the Company.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the accompanying financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
ACCOUNTING METHOD The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SavWatt USA, Inc., as well as Pro Eco Solutions, LLC for the period from November 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the Company and its subsidiary have been eliminated upon consolidation.
NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS Noncontrolling interests in our subsidiary are recorded in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, "Consolidation" and are reported as a component of equity.
DEVELOPMENT STAGE ACTIVITIES The Company has been in the development stage since its formation.
From the Company's inception through March 2010, the Company was engaged in the business of providing long-term equity and debt investment capital to fund growth, acquisitions and recapitalizations of small and middle market companies in a variety of industries, primarily located in the United States. The Company during this time frame had been very active and had conducted substantial operations, as discussed in our numerous reports with the SEC during 2007-2010.
In 2010, the Company changed its name to SavWatt USA, Inc. to reflect our new primary business of producing, marketing and selling Light Emitting Diode ("LED") lighting. In furtherance of our new business, we have obtained the exclusive marketing rights in the United States to sell LED street lighting for Unilumin, a Chinese company as well as setting up its distribution and production center in Maryland.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company's financial instruments may include cash, loans payable and related accrued interest, and accounts payable. All such instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change.
Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.
As of December 31, 2010 the Company wrote off a related party receivable amounting to $218,636 and recorded a bad debt expense, based on management's Company's evaluation of the balance and certainty that the balance would not be collectible in the future.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment are disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations for the respective period.
Depreciation is provided for over the estimated useful lives of the related asset using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows:
* Data processing equipment 3 to 5 years
INVENTORY The Company's inventory consists of entirely of finished goods, and is valued at lower of cost or market price. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out ("FIFO") basis. To ensure inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, the Company periodically evaluates the carrying value and also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items. Such evaluations are based on management's judgment and use of estimates. Such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on-hand, aging of the inventory, sales forecasts for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and, (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has not earned any revenue since inception.
USE OF ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.
SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010
PROVISION FOR TAXES Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe the Company has met the "more likely than not" standard to allow recognition of such an asset.
BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated on the weighted effect of all common shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share, which is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation, plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding, is not presented separately as it is anti-dilutive.
The average number of common shares outstanding for the period from Inception ( October 20, 2006) through December 31, 2010 has been retroactively adjusted for the 2:1 forward stock split effective August 17, 2007.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock based compensation transactions with employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 718, "Compensation, Stock Compensation" ("Topic No. 718"). Topic No. 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of the Company's equity instruments are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. In addition, the calculation of equity-based compensation costs requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited during the vesting period. The fair value of equity-based awards granted to employees is amortized over the vesting period of the award and the Company elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of Topic No. 718.
The Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees" ("Topic No. 505-50"). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, which ever is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of the equity instrument is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, the Company recognizes an asset or expense in the same manner as if it was to receive cash for the goods or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.
FORWARD STOCK SPLIT All references to the Company's outstanding shares, and options, have been adjusted to give effect to the 2 for 1 forward stock split effective August 17, 2007.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. At that date, the ASC became FASB's officially recognized source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applicable to all public and non-public non-governmental entities, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the
SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2010
authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is considered non-authoritative. The switch to the ASC affects the way companies refer to U.S. GAAP in financial statements and accounting policies. Citing particular content in the ASC involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the Topic, Subtopic, Section and Paragraph structure.
In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-08--Technical Corrections to Various Topics. This update's purpose is to eliminate GAAP inconsistencies, update outdated provisions, and provide needed clarifications. The adoption of ASU No. 2010-08 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.
The Company did not have any Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
The Company discloses the estimated fair values for all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the fair value short-term financial instruments including subscriptions receivable, loans payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to their short-term duration.
In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," effective for January 1, 2008. This guidance expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value option for any of its qualifying financial instruments
