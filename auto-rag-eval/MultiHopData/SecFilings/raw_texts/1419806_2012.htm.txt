ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Detailed information is contained herein with respect to our property. Units of measurement are reported in units used by the qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) in compiling reports on the Bear Lodge Property.
BEAR LODGE PROPERTY (Wyoming, USA)
The Bear Lodge Property is comprised of two projects, the Bear Lodge REE Project and the Sundance Gold Project. The Bear Lodge REE Project consists of the Bull Hill mine deposit, the Whitetail Ridge resource area, and the East Taylor and Carbon exploration targets. Additional details on each of these areas are set forth below under the heading “Bear Lodge REE Project”. We hold our interest in the Bear Lodge Property through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc. (“RER, Inc.”).
The Bear Lodge Property is located in central Crook County, northeastern Wyoming and is approximately 12 miles northwest of the town of Sundance, Wyoming. The Property is accessible by paved and well-maintained gravel roads. The Property lies within the Black Hills National Forest along the crest of the northern part of the Bear Lodge Mountains, a narrow northwest-trending range. Physiographically it is the northwest extension of the Black Hills in western South Dakota. The range is characterized by rolling grass- and pine-covered mountains that reach elevations of 1,950 meters within the property. The mountains have moderate slopes covered by western yellow pine forest interspersed with dense thickets of brush. Narrow grassy meadows cover the upper reaches of seasonal drainages. The lowest point within the property is about 1,768 meters in elevation. The climate during the summer is warm and relatively dry, followed by cold winters with variable amounts of snow.
Indirectly through RER, Inc., we control 100% of the mineral rights at the Bear Lodge Property, consisting of both unpatented mining claims and a Wyoming state mining lease. We hold 497 unpatented mining claims located on land administered by the U.S. Forest Service and a 259-hectare Wyoming state mining lease for a total of approximately 3,900 hectares. The Property is located within parts of Sections 5 through 9, Sections 14 through 23 and Sections 26 through 35 in Township 52 North and Range 63 West, Sixth Principal Meridian. All of the mining claims are unpatented, such that the paramount ownership and title of the land are held by the United States of America. Claim maintenance payments and related documents must be filed annually with the Wyoming State Office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and recorded with the Crook County, Wyoming Clerk and Recorder, to keep the claims from terminating by operation of law, and the claims can be maintained in good standing so long as those requirements are met. All of our Mineral Resources are located on mining rights that we hold.
Our 100% interest in the unpatented mining claims was, in part, acquired from Phelps Dodge Exploration Company (now Freeport McMoRan Corporation, (“Freeport”)) by way of a Mineral Lease and Option for Deed in 2000 and an additional 404 claims were transferred from Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) to us in May, 2010. A portion of the Newmont transferred claims had been held in a joint venture between Newmont and the Company since 2006. Some of the Newmont transferred claims (approximately 327) are subject to a perpetual 0.5% production Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalty on minerals, except for rare earth minerals, which are excluded from any royalty obligations. The Newmont transferred claims are further subject to a right of first refusal granted to Newmont for any sale or disposition of the claims to third parties by the Company. This right of first refusal applies only to parties or partners for non-rare earth extraction and terminates on May, 14, 2015. We acquired additional unpatented mining claims in 2011, which resulted in our 100% interest in 497 total unpatented mining claims.
Some of our mining claims and a portion of a defined area of influence surrounding the claims were previously subject to a production royalty of 2% of NSR payable to Freeport, but the royalty was subsequently purchased by us in March 2009. In July 2009 Rare Element Resources Ltd. assigned the Freeport royalty to Rare Element Resources, Inc. retaining the royalty as it applies to the production of rare-earth minerals. As a result of the agreements above, we hold an unencumbered rare-earth project including all 497 unpatented mining claims, free of royalties for rare-earth production. Some of the claims are subject to a non-rare earth Newmont royalty of 0.5% as described above.
The Wyoming state lease section grants us the right to prospect, mine, extract, and remove “gold, silver and precious metals, rare earth metals, base metals and other metals” from the leased area, along with surface rights “necessary to the full enjoyment” of the mineral rights. A nominal rental payment is required each year, which is currently US $2 per acre. A sliding scale royalty of 5 to 10% of an “adjusted sales value per ton” is due to the state of Wyoming if a mine is developed on the leased land, unless a lower royalty is fixed by the Board of Land Commissioners. The lease is for a period of 10 years, ending October 1, 2014, and can be renewed for additional ten-year terms.
Exploration has been carried out on Bear Lodge Property since its discovery in 1949. In addition to Freeport, several mining companies have conducted exploration and drilling programs at or near the Property since the discovery of mineralization. No mining or operations were conducted at the Bear Lodge Property by any of the prior owners.
Necessary infrastructure, such as housing, food and fuel is available in townships in close proximity to the Property. Supplies can be trucked in on both US Interstate Highway 90 and rail lines. A Burlington Northern rail transport line also runs through Moorcroft, 34 miles west of Sundance. The Gillette, Wyoming area, located approximately 55 miles to the west, has a coal-fired power plant, and would be a major logistics center for any development at the Bear Lodge Property. The current size of the property is sufficiently large to support a mining operation, with no foreseeable obstacles regarding expansion, subject to a favorable environmental permitting outcome.
We are not aware of any outstanding environmental liabilities, except for reclamation work associated with our ongoing exploration and drilling activities. We hold all the necessary permits to carry out current exploration and evaluation programs. Permits for the current operations were approved by both the U.S. Forest Service and the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. We have an approved reclamation plan and a posted reclamation bond to cover the reclamation and cost of exploration and environmental related work.
Additional local, state and federal permits will be required for a mining and processing operations should we decide to proceed to mine development and operations.
Bear Lodge Property - Location Map
BEAR LODGE REE PROJECT
Within the Bear Lodge Property, we have identified a rare earth element resource project called the Bear Lodge REE Project. Rare earth element (“REE”) mineralization occurs in the north-central core of an alkaline-igneous complex in the Bear Lodge Property. All of the most important REE deposits and occurrences within the Bear Lodge Property are contained within our unpatented mining lode claims, and are located in the vicinity of the Bull Hill mine deposit.
Rare-earth mineralized bodies occur as dikes, veins and stockwork within the Bull Hill mine deposit area of the Bear Lodge REE Project. The mineralization includes a well-defined, near-surface oxidized FMR (iron oxide-manganese oxide-REE) zone, a near-surface oxidized but incompletely leached carbonatite zone (oxide-carbonate zone), a transitional or mixed zone (oxide + sulfide), and a deeper sulfide-bearing carbonatite (a high-carbonate igneous rock) zone. The oxide-carbonate and transitional zones were referred to collectively in previous new
releases and technical reports as “transitional zone”. As our understanding of the deposit has progressed, it made sense to sub-classify mineralized zones based on key characteristics of those zones. The FMR dikes and veins contain no matrix carbonates or sulfides. The sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides, and the non-REE bearing carbonate minerals (calcite and strontianite) are completely leached from the zone, which ranges from the surface to depths of about 300 - 500 feet. The oxide-carbonate zone generally occurs beneath the oxide zone, but may locally breach the surface in select dikes. It is characterized by an absence of sulfides, with the residual iron oxides formed during the complete oxidation of the former sulfide minerals, and by variable amounts of relicit matrix carbonates (calcite ± strontianite).
Bull Hill mine deposit
The Bull Hill mine deposit contains the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as reported in our Prefeasibility Study (“PFS”) dated April 13, 2012, as further discussed below. The Bull Hill mine deposit comprises a steeply-dipping FMR-carbonatite dike swarm. Geological interpretation of results from the 2010 and 2011 drill programs indicate that the Bull Hill mine deposit resource area is dominated by northwest-striking mineralized bodies in the southern two-thirds of the resource area, while the northern part of the resource area exhibits a transitional change in strike from dominantly northwesterly to almost due north. The dike swarm primarily intrudes heterolithic intrusive breccia of the Bull Hill diatreme. Carbonatite dikes at depth are interpreted to transition toward the surface into either oxide-carbonate or FMR bodies, which range in size from veinlets to large dikes more than 30 meters in width. The Bull Hill mine deposit consists of one dominant dike set and several subsidiary dike sets in a swarm that has dimensions of more than 457 meters along strike and less than 100 meters in width. The dikes appear to pinch and swell in both strike and dip directions, and they can be traced in drill holes more than 305 meters down dip.
Prefeasibility Study
Our PFS for the Bull Hill mine deposit was principally authored by Roche Engineering Inc. (“Roche”). Roche undertook the process engineering, mine and mill capital and operating cost estimation in the PFS. Eric F. Larochelle, P.Eng., Vice President of Operations, USA, of Roche is an independent Qualified Person as defined by Canadian National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101"). He prepared or supervised the preparation of material on behalf of Roche. Michael P. Richardson, P.E., of John T. Boyd and Company of Denver, Colorado, an independent qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, prepared the mine plan for the PFS. Jaye T. Pickarts, P.E., our Chief Operations Officer and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, prepared the metallurgy and process development. Alan C. Noble, P.E., of Ore Reserves Engineering of Lakewood, Colorado, an independent qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, prepared the mineral resource estimate. The technical report summarizing the results of the PFS entitled "Rare Element Resources Inc. Bear Lodge Project Canadian NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Reserves and Development of the Bull Hill Mine." The report is dated April 13, 2012 and is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on our website at www.rareelementresources.com. The Qualified Persons listed above have reviewed the technical disclosures below.
Highlights of the Bull Hill mine deposit PFS are summarized in the following table:
The PFS was completed using a three-year average price of $17.36 per kilogram of bulk mixed rare earth oxide (“REO”) concentrates with an average grade of 45% total rare earth oxide (“TREO”). This price was derived from the three-year (2009-2011) trailing average of separated individual REO prices, FOB China, from the Metal-Pages Bulletin and based on the grades of individual REOs contained in the Measured and Indicated oxide Resource. Recognizing that the output of concentrate produced from the Bull Hill mine is a “basket mix” of individual rare earths as carbonates, a discount of 40% was assumed for the concentrate pricing in the economic models.
Mineral Resources and Reserves Estimates
The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve estimates and associated mine plan, developed by Alan C. Noble, P.E. of Ore Reserves Engineering, an independent Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and Roche Engineering and approved by the RER management team, is the basis for the development of the Bear Lodge Property NI 43-101 compliant PFS.
Reconciliation to SEC Industry Guide 7
Since we report our Mineral Reserves to both NI 43-101 and SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, it is possible for our mineral reserve figures to vary between the two standards. Where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves. For example, NI 43-101 has a minimum requirement that Mineral Reserves be supported by a pre-feasibility study, whereas SEC Industry Guide 7 requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified. At June 30, 2012, under SEC Industry Guide 7, we would have reported mineralized material of 6.8 million tonnes at a cut-off grade of 1.5% and 1.4 million tonnes at a cut-off grade of 0.9%, which include the Mineral Reserves reported above under NI 43-101 and Measured and Indicated Resources reported in the tables below, but excludes our Inferred Resource estimate.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources
This Annual Report uses the terms “Measured Mineral Resources” and “Indicated Mineral Resources.” We advise U.S. investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize them. US investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into Mineral Reserves.
Our Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, which are reported in this Annual Report, do not include that part of our Mineral Resources that have been converted to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves as shown above, and have been estimated in compliance with definitions set out in NI 43-101. We have filed Technical Reports regarding the disclosure of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for the Bear Lodge Project properties as required by NI 43-101 regulations. See our “Glossary of Terms.”
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources
This Annual Report uses the term “Inferred Mineral Resources.” We advise U.S. investors that while this term is
recognized and required by NI 43-101, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize it. “Inferred Mineral Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of Inferred Mineral Resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of the Inferred Mineral Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
Our Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated in compliance with definitions defined by NI 43-101. Rare Element has filed Technical Reports regarding the disclosure of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for the Bear Lodge Project properties as required by NI 43-101. See our “Glossary of Terms.”
The updated Mineral Resource estimate of May 7, 2012 and the Mineral Reserves reported in the PFS dated April 2012 confirm that potentially economic resources are present in the Bull Hill mine deposit area, and they justify further technical work, including drilling, metallurgical testing, and engineering studies. Considerable in-fill definition drilling is required to increase the confidence level and upgrade more of the inferred resources to the indicated category, and this drilling is in progress in our 2012 drill program. Step-out drilling is planned to expand the resource and define the boundaries of the mineralization.
The major dike sets in all of the resource areas are accompanied by peripheral zones of lower-grade stockwork REE mineralization. The term “stockwork” refers to a body of rock cut by a network of small veins or dikes that contain the mineralization. REE grades in the stockwork zones range between about 0.5 and 2.5 percent REO.
Quality Assurance
The Mineral Resource estimate was completed by Mr. Alan C. Noble, P.E., principal engineer of Ore Reserves Engineering, and is based on geological interpretations supplied by the Company to Ore Reserves Engineering and subsequently modified by Ore Reserves Engineering. Mr. Noble is an independent Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators and has verified the data disclosed here.
Our field programs were carried out under the supervision of Dr. James G. Clark, the Company’s Vice President of Exploration. Dr. Clark was a senior geologist and, subsequently, exploration supervisor for Hecla Mining Company during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s and was responsible for that company’s exploration of Bull Hill and the Bear Lodge district, and its initial discovery of the Bull Hill SW resource area. A detailed QA/QC program was implemented for the 2007 through 2012 drill programs. The QA/QC program was organized by Dr. Jeffrey Jaacks. Dr. Jaacks and Dr. Clark have verified the sampling procedures and QA/QC data delivered to Ore Reserves Engineering. They share the opinion that the data are of good quality and suitable for use in the Mineral Resource estimate.
Metallurgy
The resource size is sensitive to an assumed cut-off grade, which is also sensitive to metallurgical operating costs. The metallurgical testing is ongoing on oxide samples. Nearly all of the minable material is sufficiently close to the surface for potential mining by open pit methods. The current oxide and oxide carbonate proven and probable mineral reserves contain 5.7 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 3.6% REO and 1.4 million tonnes of oxide stockwork ore at a grade of 1.1% REO. The oxide mineralization extends from surface to depths of approximately 122 meters. The current testing program conducted on this oxide mineralization is designed to take advantage of the unique type of mineral occurrence in the REE mineralization. The mineralization is characterized by fine-grained REE minerals that variably adhere to the surfaces of the coarser gangue (non-REE-bearing) minerals. The REE minerals in oxide mineralization from the mineral resource area are largely from the bastnasite group (bastnasite, synchysite, and parasite) with variable, but subordinate, proportions of monazite and cerianite.
Metallurgical testwork is being conducted at Mountain States R&D International, Inc. (MSRDI) of Vail, Arizona. Confirmatory testing was conducted by NAGROM of Perth, Australia with preliminary RE purification and separation testwork being conducted by ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization) of Sydney, Australia. Bulk sampling of oxide mineralization from large diameter drill core and from surface trenches took place in the Fall of 2010. The bulk sample was processed in a pilot plant test to support the PFS that was completed in 2012.
Rare-earth mineralized bodies occur as high-grade dikes and veins within the Bull Hill deposit. They include a well-defined, near-surface oxidized zone that has been the subject of most metallurgical testing to date. The oxide mineralization contains essentially no matrix carbonates or sulfides. The sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides, and the non-REE bearing carbonate minerals (calcite and strontianite) are completely leached from the zone, which ranges from the surface to depths of about 150 meters. These conditions created a loose and friable oxide material that allows for a simple physical mineral processing method.
In parts of the high-grade zone, the sulfides are oxidized but matrix carbonate is partially and variably leached. This zone is termed the “oxide-carbonate” zone. A thin “transitional zone” occurs at the base of the oxide and/or oxide-carbonate zone at a depth of approximately 150 meters. The transitional zone passes relatively abruptly into the sulfide-bearing zone with typical carbonatite characteristics.
Tests on the high-grade oxide mineralization indicate that a recovery of 81% of REO is expected using a two-stage process. The first stage is mineral concentration, also known as physical upgrading (“PUG”). The second stage is a chemical leaching process using hydrochloric acid that produces a mixed rare-earths leachate that is precipitated as a bulk carbonate concentrate. The series of bench-scale testing programs was completed by MSRDI under the direction of Dr. Roshan Bhappu and a pilot plant test program was completed by Hazen Research. A parallel series of tests to verify the process was conducted by Nagrom of Perth, Australia, under the direction of Mr. Tony Wilkinson, General Manager.
Additional testwork is currently in progress at SGS Lakefield to evaluate the variability in metallurgical performance based on the spatial and minor mineralogical differences throughout the deposit.
Jaye T. Pickarts, P.E., who is the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, is the Qualified Person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the contents of the “Metallurgy” section of this Annual Report.
Other Exploration Targets at the Bear Lodge REE Project
Discoveries of high-grade REE mineralization at the Whitetail Ridge resource area and the East Taylor and Carbon target areas expand the area of known REE mineralization outside of the Bull Hill deposits and identify a “district” underlain by significant and potentially economic REE mineralization. The data indicates that the Bear Lodge REE area covers a crudely elliptical area that extends approximately 1,750 meters northwest-southeast by 1,300 meters northeast-southwest. The Whitetail Ridge resource area and Carbon target are located northwest of the Bull Hill deposits, and the East Taylor target is located west of the Bull Hill deposits. Based on a re-evaluation of assay data for the Whitetail Ridge and Carbon areas during our most recent resource estimation, and REE assay data from the 2011 drilling program at the Whitetail Ridge resource area and East Taylor and Carbon target areas, assay grades for individual REE between deposits and target areas at the Bear Lodge project indicate a zonation of what are referred to as Light Rare Earth Elements (“LREE”) and HREEs in the district. The mineralization at Whitetail Ridge resource area and at the East Taylor and Carbon exploration target areas has a distribution characterized by elevated abundances of HREE relative to the mineralization at the Bull Hill mine deposit. The three western mineralized zones are characterized by high grades for total REO, as well as some of the highest grades of HREE in North American deposits. They are particularly enriched in europium, terbium, dysprosium, and yttrium (Eu, Tb, Dy, and Y). The HREE enrichment was identified during the re-examination of reverse circulation drill chips in several of the Company’s gold exploration holes. The mineralized intervals in gold exploration drill holes SUN-076, SUN-079, and SUN-090 were submitted for quantitative REE analyses in 2011, and additional intercepts from selected gold exploration drill holes at the Carbon and Taylor exploration target areas were submitted earlier in 2012. The assay results demonstrate significant HREE enrichment at Whitetail Ridge resource area and at the Carbon and Taylor exploration targets. LREE generally include Ce, La, Nd, Pr, and Sm; HREE include Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y.
These new discoveries indicate good potential for new deposits of high-grade REE in the western half of the Bear Lodge REE Project, and those deposits appear particularly enriched in the HREE.
We reported an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate on May 7, 2012 for the Whitetail Ridge exploration area as set forth in the table below:

Whitetail Ridge Mineral Resource Estimate
2012 REE Drill Program
The 2012 REE drilling program commenced in early June 2012 at the Bear Lodge Property. Four core drilling rigs and one rotary (reverse circulation) drill rig are currently onsite and will be used to test REE mineralization at the Bull Hill mine deposit and Whitetail Ridge resource areas, and at the Carbon and East Taylor REE target areas. The program to test the REE mineralization is planned to consist of approximately 60 angle drill holes to general depths of 122 meters to 366 meters. We expect to augment the REE drilling program by geological mapping, geophysical surveys, soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, and additional bulk sampling of near-surface mineralized material.
SUNDANCE GOLD PROJECT
The Sundance Gold Project is the second project located on our Bear Lodge Property. For a description of the property’s location, ownership, accessibility, infrastructure and climate, see the section heading “Item 2. Properties - Bear Lodge Property (Wyoming, USA)” above. There is no exploration work planned for this project in 2012.
Mineral Resources
We reported a NI 43-101compliant Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Sundance Gold Project on March 15, 2011. Ore Reserves Engineering of Lakewood, Colorado prepared the gold Mineral Resource estimate.
Drill-hole Database Compilation and Mineral Resource Estimation
Following compilation of the Sundance drill-hole database, Ore Reserves Engineering analyzed the data to determine the size, shape, and internal continuity of the three principal gold mineralization areas in order to calculate Inferred Mineral Resources. Alan C. Noble, P.E., is the Principal Engineer of Ore Reserves Engineering and is an independent Qualified Person for the purpose of Canadian NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. These wireframe models will also be utilized to design the optimal placement of new drill holes completed in 2011.
The East and West Breccias of the Smith deposit were discovered by FMC (1982-1986), and subsequently explored by International Curator and Coca Mines (“Coca”). In 1991, Coca estimated an historical Mineral Resource of 7.4 million tonnes at a grade of 0.02 ounces of gold per tonne (0.68 g/t; not NI 43-101compliant) for the two mineralized areas. We are not treating the historical estimate as NI 43-101 defined mineral resources verified by a Qualified Person, and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. The new Ore Reserves Engineering Mineral Resource estimate updates this historical Mineral Resource estimate to the current standards and incorporates the
drilling that we completed during the past several years and Newmont Mining Corporation. The new Smith Inferred Mineral Resource estimate includes 25.2 million tonnes grading 0.50 grams of gold/tonne at a cutoff grade of 0.15 g/t. Inferred Mineral Resource estimates for the Taylor and Carbon areas are also shown in the table below.

Notes
·
The base case is chosen at an assumed gold price of $1200 per ounce.
·
Mineral Resources are estimated using inverse-distance-power (IDP) estimation within 3-dimensional wireframe models based on the geologic interpretation and continuous mineralization above an approximate 0.05 ppm Au cutoff grade. Drill holes were composited to 5-meter intervals for Mineral Resource estimation and were capped, after compositing, at 3 ppm Au for all deposits except for Smith, which was capped at 5 ppm Au.
·
All mineral resources are classified as Inferred Mineral Resource as defined by CIM and referenced in NI 43-101.
·
Floating cone studies at a range of gold prices are used to demonstrate the potential for economic extraction of the mineral resource. The floating cone studies are not considered to be an economic study and should not be relied upon as an economic study.
·
Floating cone parameters include: Pit slope of 42 degrees, Mining Cost of $2/tonne ore and $1.75/tonne waste, processing and pad costs of $2.50/tonne ore, G&A costs of $0.50/tonne ore, and gold recovery of 65 percent. These parameters are believed to be reasonable, order-of-magnitude estimates for a low-cost, run-of-mine, heap leaching operation.
