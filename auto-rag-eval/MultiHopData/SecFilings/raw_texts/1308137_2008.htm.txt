ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
Executive Offices
Blacksands assumed a sublease for its head office in Toronto, Canada effective October 1, 2008 for $2,750 Cdn per month plus applicable taxes, which runs until January 30, 2012. We do not currently maintain any investments in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of persons primarily engaged in real estate activities, nor do we expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
Access’ Property
The A10 Project
The initial exploration project is named “A10 Project” and lies on a portion of the land controlled by the BRDN subject to Treaty 10 (“Treaty 10”) in western Saskatchewan on the border with Alberta (the “Project Land”). The BRDN is a party to Treaty 10 with Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of Canada (the “Crown”) which recognizes lands and water belonging to the BRDN whose territory is situated partly in the Province of Saskatchewan and partly in the Province of Alberta. Upon entering into Treaty 10, the BRDN did not cede, release, surrender or yield to the Crown any or all rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to the BRDN’s traditional territories. Lands and waters described in Treaty 10 form a part of the traditional territories of the BRDN. Access signed the Joint Venture Agreement with the BRDDC on November 3, 2006 (subsequently amended on May 9, 2007 and March 17, 2008) granting Access exclusive access to the land. A copy of this agreement is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10.1, and its amendment of May 9, 2007 is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10.5. The amendment of March 17, 2008 is incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.5.1.

In connection with our initial exploration, on May 24, 2007, we purchased two dimensional seismic data relating to various data lines totaling approximately 750 kilometers in length within the A10 Project. We had the data analyzed and believe that on the basis of the preliminary analysis that certain areas of interest show promising indications for further exploration. We are conducting additional technical data-seeking and evaluation. We are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and approvals to carry out exploration work.
The La Loche Project
The La Loche Project lies on Traditional Lands of the La Loche Community as outlined in bold on the map below. It covers approximately 3,000,000 hectares of La Loche Traditional Lands in north western Saskatchewan, north and west of the town of La Loche, Saskatchewan.

Access will be considered the Operator of various projects (each a “Project”), as described in the 1990 Operating Procedure of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Landmen (“CAPL”), which sets forth many standard contract terms used in connection with development and management of petroleum producing properties. A Project is defined in the Joint Venture Agreement as (i) in the case of a gas or conventional oil discovery, the drilling, completion and tie-in of a single gas well or conventional oil well and (ii) in the case of a heavy oil discovery, an oil sands pool development including all drilling, completions and facilities in conjunction with such discovery.
Being the Operator means Access will have overall supervision, direction and control of contemplated exploration and development. Access is permitted to select, subject to a formal bid process, and direct a suitable engineering firm to manage the startup, management, and ongoing requirements of each Project, and to engage in actual extraction efforts of petroleum deposits.
There are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us, and we are unaware of any governmental authority initiating or contemplating a proceeding against us.

Dividend Policy
There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:
1.
we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or
2.
our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.
We have not declared any dividends, and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS (See also Item 10)
We have one equity compensation plan: the 2006 Stock Option Plan. This plan has been approved by our stockholders. The 2006 Stock Option Plan has been amended, and will be presented to our stockholders for approval at the Annual Meeting and are described below under the heading “Amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan” in Item 10 of this Form 10-K report.
2006 Stock Option Plan
On June 26, 2006, our Board of Directors and the holders of a majority (55.2%) of our then outstanding common stock approved our 2006 Stock Option Plan (the “2006 Plan”). The purpose of the 2006 Plan is to provide an incentive to attract and retain directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees whose services are considered valuable, to encourage a sense of proprietorship and to stimulate an active interest of such persons into our development and financial success. Under the 2006 Plan, we are authorized to issue incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock. The 2006 Plan is administered by our Board of Directors. As of the date of this report, there were no stock options outstanding under the 2006 Plan.
Securities Authorized for Issuance

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors, which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and it should be read in conjunction with such audited consolidated financial statements.
On August 3, 2007, we completed the purchase of 75% of Access Energy Inc. (“Access”) for cash of US$3,234,545 and 1,500,000 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued to the former sole stockholder of Access. We expect that the Purchase will cause our plan of operation, results of operations and capital resources to differ materially from our financial position as it existed prior to the Purchase. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Blacksands is now responsible for funding 100% of Access’ operations including general and administration, and all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development, until such time as Access is self-sufficient. (The minority shareholder is not required to fund any of Access’ costs.) This will have an impact on the operating results of Blacksands, the balance sheet, and cash position.
Subsequent to the Purchase, Access has commenced activities to obtain the permits, licenses and sub-surface rights necessary to begin our exploration activities.
The A10 Project
The initial exploration project for Access is named “A10 Project” and lies on a portion of the traditional land of the Buffalo River Dene Nation (the “BRDN”) subject to Treaty 10 (“Treaty 10”) in western Saskatchewan on the border with Alberta (the “Project Land”). The BRDN is a party to Treaty 10 with Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of Canada (the “Crown”) which recognizes lands and water belonging to the BRDN whose territory is situated partly in the Province of Saskatchewan and partly in the Province of Alberta. Upon entering into Treaty 10, the BRDN did not cede, release, surrender or yield to the Crown any or all rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to the BRDN’s traditional territories. Lands and waters described in Treaty 10 form a part of the traditional territories of the BRDN. Access signed the Joint Venture Agreement with the BRDDC in November 2006, amended on May 18, 2007, and further amended on March 17, 2008, granting Access exclusive access to the land. A copy of this agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.8 to our Form 8-K/A filed on February 19, 2009, and incorporated by reference herein.
Pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement, the Company is responsible for 100% of the costs to explore and develop any project within the traditional lands. After all costs relating to a specific project have been recouped, the Company will retain a 90% interest and the BRDDC will be entitled to the remaining minority interest of the Project. Furthermore, the BRDDC is entitled to earn up to an additional 20% interest in any project(s) by contributing its pro rata share of the costs to explore and develop any project(s). Even if the BRDDC chooses to participate to the full extent permitted by the JV Agreement, the Company would continue to hold a majority of the working interest in the project.
In addition, the Company is committed to make certain contributions to the BRDN on or before May 24 of every year for capacity and infrastructure building and for reimbursement of costs for traditional lands staffing and to support training and development of the BRDN community in the range of Cdn$1,000,000 to Cdn$1,300,000 per year. Additionally, the Company is committed to expend up to Cdn$1,000,000 to assist BRDN forestry contractors to transition to approved contractors for the A10 Project. Finally, the Company is committed to providing a loan of up to Cdn$5,000,000 to assist the BRDDC to fund an increase in ownership of the A10 Project from the current 10% interest to up to 30% interest when production is to commence. All amounts paid or advanced are potentially recoverable as part of the Company’s earned working interest in the A10 Project.
As at October 31, 2008, the Company had paid or accrued a total of approximately Cdn$2,098,500 (approximately US$1,742,200) to the BRDN and is committed to further payments totalling in the aggregate of approximately Cdn$25,000,000 over the term of the agreement which expires in 2027.
Subsequent to the Purchase, we have continued work to obtain the permits, licenses and sub-surface rights necessary to commence our exploration activities.
At a Board of Directors’ meeting on February 15, 2008, the Board of Directors approved operating budgets for the Company and for Access for the year ended October 31, 2008. The Access budget included cost expectations to obtain the required permits, approvals, licences and sub-surface rights, which would enable the Company to carry out work on the A10 Project.
On August 11, 2008, the Company, through its subsidiary, Access, submitted bids for the oilsands exploratory permits covering approximately 810,000 acres of the A10 Project lands that were posted for sale by the Province of Saskatchewan (the “Province”) on May 29, 2008. On August 13, 2008, the Province of Saskatchewan announced that there were no successful bidders for these oilsands exploratory permits. At Access Energy’s request, the Province re-posted these permits for bidding on December 3, 2008. Access bid on the permits, but again there were no successful bidders.
The La Loche Project
On October 15, 2008, Access signed a Joint Venture Agreement and an Impact Benefit Agreement (the “Agreements”) with La Loche Clearwater Development Authority. The Agreements were subject to the ratification by the aboriginal residents of the area (the La Loche “Community”) before they are effective.
On February 14, 2009, the Community ratified the Joint Venture Agreement and the Impact Benefit Agreement signed by Access and the La Loche Clearwater Development Authority (“LLCDA”) on October 15, 2008.
The Agreements cover approximately 3,000,000 hectares of La Loche Traditional Lands (the “Traditional Lands”) in north western Saskatchewan, north and west of the town of La Loche, Saskatchewan. They allow Access to exclusively participate in the acquisition, exploration and development of certain surface and subsurface rights in and to the Traditional Lands with respect to petroleum and mining products (the “Products”).
The terms of the Agreements are for twenty years from the date of signing (October 15, 2008), and automatically renew for consecutive terms of twenty years if Access provides notice of renewal to LLCDA before the expiration of the Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, Access paid Cdn$15,000 (approximately US$12,500) on the signing of the Agreements, and is obligated to pay to the LLCDA Cdn$75,000 (approximately US$62,300) at the start of each three-month period upon ratification of the Agreements (or Cdn$300,000 annually - approximately US$249,000). As well, Access is obligated to pay a 5% gross overriding royalty to LLCDA from the production of any Products.
The Company is committed, under the Unanimous Shareholders’ Agreement among Access, the Company and the minority shareholder, to contribute sufficient capital to Access to meet Access’s planned financial commitments until such time as Access has sufficient internal capital resources to fund its commitments without such contributions. These contributions are treated as a contribution of capital, with no increase in our current 75% equity participation in Access. Therefore, all contributions that we make to Access are dilutive to our shareholders as to 25% of such contributions. The minority shareholder is not obligated to provide any funding to Access in order to maintain his 25% interest in Access.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “Blacksands”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” refer to both Blacksands and Access. In our consolidated financial statements, this management’s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report, unless otherwise noted, we include 100% of the accounts of Access from the date of acquisition of August 3, 2007. For a discussion of our principles of consolidation, see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Selected Consolidated Financial Information of Blacksands
Consolidated Results of Operations
For the year ended October 31, 2008, and since our inception on October 12, 2004, we have not generated any revenue.
We incurred total operating expenses of $1,995,144 for the year ended October 31, 2008, as compared to total operating expenses of $2,723,183 for the year ended October 31, 2007. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day-to-day operations of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports as well as the management fee paid to Coniston Investment Corp. pursuant to a consulting management agreement between Coniston Investment Corp., a company controlled by Paul Parisotto, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Access Energy Inc. The significant operating expenses include professional fees of $616,882 for the year ended October 31, 2008 incurred in connection with filing of periodic reports, SEC compliance filings, legal, audit and accounting fees, and general corporate matters as compared with professional fees of $616,629 for the year ended October 31, 2007. The office and administration expenses of $136,978 for the year ended October 31, 2008 include rent, travel, telephone and other office expenses, net of recovered Canadian Goods and Services Tax, as compared to office and administration expenses of $171,653 for the year ended October 31, 2007. The management and directors’ fees of $319,929 for the year ended October 31, 2008 includes the directors’ fee and Coniston’s fee referred to above, compared to employee remuneration of $154,296 for the year ended October 31, 2007 which includes management fees paid to Coniston for the period of August 3, 2007 (post-acquisition) to October 31, 2007 only, and no directors fees, and other amounts paid to management in 2007.
During the year ended October 31, 2008, we incurred exploration expenses of $905,691 compared to exploration expenses of $1,772,481 for the year ended October 31, 2007. The exploration expense in the year ended October 31, 2007 related to the purchase of certain seismic data for a portion of the Project Land and consulting fees paid to analyze the data as well on costs associated to maintaining the Company’s interest in the A10 Project after the acquisition of Access. The exploration expenses for the year ended October 31, 2008 include costs associated with maintaining the Company’s interest in the A10 Project as well as costs to investigate the acquisition of additional projects which are not expected to yield a new acquisition project for the Company.
We earned total interest income of $141,846 for the year ended October 31, 2008, as compared to total interest income of $405,691 for the year ended October 31, 2007. The interest for the years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 was earned from the investment of proceeds of a private placement of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants on August 9, 2006, which remained in interest bearing instruments during the above periods, and which balance has diminished over the course of the fourth quarter of 2007 and throughout 2008 with the purchase of Access and with ongoing operations. The use of cash in the consolidated operations as well as declining interest rates reduced our interest income on excess cash in the year ended October 31, 2008.
We incurred an amount of $276,399 in the year ended October 31, 2008 as funding on behalf of the minority stockholder (represents a charge to the Company for 25% of capital advanced and used by Access in February 2008 of $1,105,596). In the year ended October 31, 2007, we incurred a comparative amount of $261,656 as a charge to the Company for 25% of capital contributed by the Company to Access in August 2007 in the amount of $1,046,622, after the acquisition of 75% of Access.
The minority interest amount of $301,739 for the year ended October 31, 2008 represents 25% share of minority stockholders of Access of the losses incurred by Access from November 1, 2007 to October 31, 2008 (excluding capital contribution to subsidiary on behalf of minority shareholder of $276,399 that is not recoverable from the minority shareholder) compared to a minority interest amount of $194,749 for the period from August 3, 2007 (date of acquisition of Access) to October 31, 2007 (also excluding capital contribution to subsidiary on behalf of minority shareholder of $261,656 at October 31, 2007 that is not recoverable from the minority shareholder).
The gain from foreign currency exchange of $263,868 at October 31, 2008 arose as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate on US-denominated transactions in the year.
Our total comprehensive loss for the year ended October 31, 2008 was $3,521,299, compared to total comprehensive loss of $1,655,725 for the year ended October 31, 2007, and a total comprehensive loss of $5,501,898 from inception on October 12, 2004 to October 31, 2008.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2008 was $1,012,181, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3,170,777 for the year ended October 31, 2007 and $4,218,222 for the period from inception on October 12, 2004 to October 31, 2008. $3,049,148 (net of cash in Access on acquisition) in the year ended October 31, 2007 was to purchase Access, net of cash acquired.
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2008 was $nil, compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2007 of $50,000, resulting from purchase of 30,000,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Darren Stevenson under the share buy back agreement.
As of October 31, 2008, the combined companies had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $2,610,232, and short-term investments of $835,418. The Company believes this amount to be sufficient to fund the Company’s general and administrative costs for the next twelve months, and fund the work necessary to obtain permits, licenses and necessary approvals to commence exploration activities on the A10 Project, and as needed, for the La Loche Project. If the Company is successful in obtaining the permits, licenses and necessary approvals, it will require additional capital to carry out any additional exploration activities, and the funding may come through the exercising of outstanding warrants and/or through the raising of additional capital. In the interim, the Company is closely monitoring its cash balances and is minimizing its use of cash as much as possible.
The Company has incurred losses, and does not believe the Company has any tax liabilities for the years 2004 to 2008 inclusive. We have commissioned the preparation of the income tax returns and expect to have them completed and filed as soon as possible.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that our policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Our significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to our financial statements.
When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from the amounts previously estimated, which were based on the information available at the time the estimates were made. Changes in estimates are recorded if and when better information becomes available.
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make an assumption about a matter that was highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of a different estimate that we reasonably could have used in the current period, could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
We have established an Audit Committee consisting of two non-executive Directors. The members of the Audit Committee are Bruno Mosimann and Mark Holcombe.
Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Going Concern
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a “going concern” basis, which presumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.
The Company is in the process of exploring resource properties and has not yet determined whether the properties contain economically recoverable reserves. The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from its operating activities for the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, and since inception.
The Company’s management continues to focus on the exploration, delineation, and ultimate exploitation of bitumen on the lands in northern Saskatchewan and Alberta, and completion of the acquisition of surface rights with the La Loche Clearwater Development Authority to explore the traditional lands of La Loche in northwestern Saskatchewan (note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, obtaining additional financing to develop the properties, the ultimate realization of profits through future production or sale of properties, and the success of the Company’s business plan. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue its business.
Oil and Gas Properties
The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to exploration expense. The costs of unproved properties, which are determined to be productive, are transferred to proved oil and gas properties and amortized on an equivalent unit-of-production basis. Exploratory expenses, including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for unevaluated oil and gas properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized as unproved property but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, exploratory drilling costs are evaluated within a one-year period after the completion of drilling.
New Accounting Pronouncements
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is a relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practices. This Statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier application is permitted provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year. Management is currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company once adopted for its fiscal year ending October 31, 2009.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement applies to all entities, including not-for-profit organizations. Most of the provisions of this Statement apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair value option permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates.
A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings (or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings) at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument (with a few exceptions); is irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs); and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to materially effect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This Statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. This Statement’s scope is broader than that of Statement 141, which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration. By applying the same method of accounting-the acquisition method-to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, this Statement improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports.
This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. That replaces Statement 141’s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
This Statement applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity (the acquirer) obtains control of one or more businesses (the acquirer), including those sometimes referred to as “true mergers” or “mergers of equals” and combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration, for example, by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights. This Statement applies to all business entities, including mutual entities that previously used the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for some business combinations. It does not apply to: (a) The formation of a joint venture, (b) The acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business, (c) A combination between entities or businesses under common control, (d) A combination between not-for-profit organizations or the acquisition of a for-profit business by a not-for-profit organization.
This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted for its fiscal year starting November 1, 2009.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 - Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 - Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non-controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. Not-for-profit organizations should continue to apply the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, before the amendments made by this Statement, and any other applicable standards, until the Board issues interpretative guidance.
This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Before this Statement was issued, limited guidance existed for reporting non-controlling interests. As a result, considerable diversity in practice existed. So-called minority interests were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This Statement improves comparability by eliminating that diversity.
A non-controlling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require: (a) The ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity, (b) The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (c) Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently. A parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes if the parent purchases additional ownership interests in its subsidiary or if the parent sells some of its ownership interests in its subsidiary. It also changes if the subsidiary reacquires some of its ownership interests or the subsidiary issues additional ownership interests. All of those transactions are economically similar, and this Statement requires that they be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, (d) When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non-controlling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment, (e) Entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners.
This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (that is, November 1, 2009, for the Company). Earlier adoption is prohibited. This Statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted since it relates only to presentation.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 - Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 - Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.
This Statement addresses the increased use and complexity of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities. It applies to all entities.
This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption.
The Statement requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
The Statement requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.
Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted since the Company does not currently have any derivative instruments or hedging activities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Directors and Shareholders of
Blacksands Petroleum, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. as of October 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and for the period October 12, 2004 (inception) through October 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. as of October 31, 2007 and for the year then ended, and for the period October 12, 2004 (inception) through October 31, 2007, were audited by other auditors whose report dated January 28, 2008, except from inception (October 12, 2004) through October 31, 2005, dated February 2, 2009 and Note 13, dated February 17, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion on these statements and included an explanatory paragraph that the financial statements were prepared assuming that Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. will continue as a going concern. We did not audit the period October 12, 2004 (inception) through October 31, 2007 which include total expenses and net loss of $3,181,896 and $3,274,088 respectively. The consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the period October 12, 2004 (inception) through October 31, 2007 were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts for this period, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. as of October 31, 2008 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The 2008 financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. and Subsidiary
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. and Subsidiary as of October 31, 2007 (Restated) and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows from October 12, 2004 (Inception) to October 31, 2006 and for the year ended October 31, 2007 (Restated). These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. and Subsidiary as of October 31, 2007 (restated) and 2006 and the results of their operations and their cash flows from October 12, 2004 (Inception) to October 31, 2006 and for the year ended October 31, 2007 (restated), in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as more fully described in Note 1. These issues among others raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of business and history - Blacksands Petroleum, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 12, 2004 as Lam Liang Corp. The Company was formed to design, produce and sell fashionable computer laptop cases for women through a subsidiary, which was subsequently dissolved on June 5, 2006. The Company’s operations were limited to general administrative operations and development of its first product line and the Company was considered an exploration stage company in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7, and exited its plan of operation on May 6, 2006. To indicate its new direction into the unconventional oil industry, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation on June 9, 2006 to change its name from “Lam Liang Corp.” to “Blacksands Petroleum, Inc.” On August 3, 2007, the Company completed its purchase of 75% of the capital of Access Energy Inc. (“Access” or “Access Energy”). Prior to the purchase, the Company was a “shell” company as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. By consummating the purchase, the Company succeeded at its business plan, which was to enter the unconventional petroleum industry by acquiring a suitable target company. The Company currently operates in only one segment - unconventional oil and gas exploration.
Going Concern - These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a “going concern” basis, which presumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.
The Company is in the process of exploring resource properties and has not yet determined whether the properties contain economically recoverable reserves. The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from its operating activities for the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, and since inception.
The Company’s management continues to focus on the exploration, delineation, and ultimate exploitation of bitumen on the lands in northern Saskatchewan and Alberta, and completion of the acquisition of surface rights with the La Loche Clearwater Development Authority to explore the traditional lands of La Loche in northwestern Saskatchewan (note 4).
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, obtaining additional financing to develop the properties, the ultimate realization of profits through future production or sale of properties, and the success of the Company’s business plan. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue its business.
Year end - The Company’s fiscal year end is October 31.
Principles of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its subsidiary Access Energy Inc., which is 75% owned by the Company, from the date of acquisition of August 3, 2007. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company is required to fund the operations of Access until Access is self-sustaining. Funding on behalf of the minority shareholder is expensed as incurred in the statement of operations. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Use of estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on account and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less on the date of acquisition. Investments with original maturities of greater than three months are considered short-term investments.
Concentration of credit risks - The Company’s consolidated financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, cash held in trust, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments accounts are held with reputable Canadian financial institutions, and are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (“CDIC”) up to Cdn$100,000. During years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, the Company has maintained bank balances exceeding the CDIC insurance limits. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company periodically evaluates the credit quality of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. The Company has determined that there are no issues regarding the credit quality of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits, and any risk of loss to be remote. The Company does not have investments in asset-backed commercial paper.
Oil and Gas Properties - The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed to determine whether they have been impaired, and any impairment in value is charged to exploration expense. The costs of unproved properties, which are determined to be productive, are transferred to proved oil and gas properties and amortized on an equivalent unit-of-production basis. Exploratory expenses, including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for unevaluated oil and gas properties, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized as unproved property but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, exploratory drilling costs are evaluated within a one-year period after the completion of drilling.
Property and equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 27 years. The amounts of depreciation provided are sufficient to charge the cost of the related assets to operations over their estimated useful lives. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable property, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations.
The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability.
Income taxes - The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that would otherwise be recorded for income tax benefits primarily relating to operating loss carryforwards as realization cannot be determined to be more likely than not.
Net loss per common share - The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 (SAB 98). Under the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98, basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation -, The functional currency of the Company is the Canadian Dollar. The Company uses the United States Dollar as its reporting currency for consistency with registrants of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than Canadian dollar (functional currency) are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items are translated at historical rates. All exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
The functional currency financial statements are translated to the Company’s US dollars reporting currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end exchange rate, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The unrealized foreign exchange impact of these translations is included in the accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash held in trust, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and deposits, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value at October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 because of the short period to maturity of these instruments.
Revenue recognition - The Company has no revenues to date from its operations.
Stock based compensation - The Company has a stock-based compensation plan, which is described in note 6. For stock options, compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options at the grant date and is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date the award is vested, and its exercisability does not depend on continued service by the option holder. Compensation expense is recognized as general and administrative expenses, with a corresponding amount included in equity as additional paid in capital.
The additional paid in capital is reduced as options are exercised and the amount initially recorded for the options in the additional paid in capital is credited to common stock, along with the proceeds received on exercise. In the event that options are forfeited or cancelled prior to having vested, any previously recognized expense is reversed in the period of forfeiture or cancellation.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
New accounting pronouncements -
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is a relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practices. This Statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier application is permitted provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year. Management is currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company once adopted for its fiscal year ending October 31, 2009.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement applies to all entities, including not-for-profit organizations. Most of the provisions of this Statement apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair value option permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates.
A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings (or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings) at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument (with a few exceptions); is irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs); and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to materially effect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This Statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. This Statement’s scope is broader than that of Statement 141, which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration. By applying the same method of accounting-the acquisition method-to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, this Statement improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports.
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. That replaces Statement 141’s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
This Statement applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity (the acquirer) obtains control of one or more businesses (the acquirer), including those sometimes referred to as “true mergers” or “mergers of equals” and combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration, for example, by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights. This Statement applies to all business entities, including mutual entities that previously used the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for some business combinations. It does not apply to: (a) The formation of a joint venture, (b) The acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business, (c) A combination between entities or businesses under common control, (d) A combination between not-for-profit organizations or the acquisition of a for-profit business by a not-for-profit organization.
This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted for its fiscal year starting November 1, 2009.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 - Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 - Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non-controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. Not-for-profit organizations should continue to apply the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, before the amendments made by this Statement, and any other applicable standards, until the Board issues interpretative guidance.
This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Before this Statement was issued, limited guidance existed for reporting non-controlling interests. As a result, considerable diversity in practice existed. So-called minority interests were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This Statement improves comparability by eliminating that diversity.
A non-controlling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require: (a) The ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity, (b) The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (c) Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently.
1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
A parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes if the parent purchases additional ownership interests in its subsidiary or if the parent sells some of its ownership interests in its subsidiary. It also changes if the subsidiary reacquires some of its ownership interests or the subsidiary issues additional ownership interests. All of those transactions are economically similar, and this Statement requires that they be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, (d) When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non-controlling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment, (e) Entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners.
This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (that is, November 1, 2009, for the Company). Earlier adoption is prohibited. This Statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted since it relates only to presentation.
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 - Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 - Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.
This Statement addresses the increased use and complexity of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities. It applies to all entities.
This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption.
The Statement requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
The Statement requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.
Management believes this Statement will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company once adopted since the Company does not currently have any derivative instruments or hedging activities.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
2.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH HELD IN TRUST
The Company’s short-term investment, a redeemable short-term investment certificate, is classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of this investment approximated its carrying value which is its cost plus accrued interest. The certificate principal and contracted interest are guaranteed, and accordingly there is no gain or loss to be recorded. Until the short-term investment matures, the Company records an accrual for interest earned, with a credit to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. When the short-term investment matures, cost is the value of the principal and interest recorded. During 2007, the Company had $44,396 of cash held in trust with its legal counsel as the balance of funds held in escrow.
3.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
The Company disposed of all property and equipment during the year. The Company owned the following furniture and office equipment at October 31, 2007:
Depreciation expense amounted to $3,076 and $8,124 for the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
4.
OIL AND GAS PROPERTY COSTS
In the years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, the Company incurred property acquisition costs as follows:
Balance, beginning of year
$ 4,626,809
$ -
Acquisition cost allocated to oil & gas property costs on payment on August 3, 2007 to Access Energy Inc.

Balance, end of year

The gain of $492,702 for 2007 is the increase in the US$ amount of oil & gas property costs, including the net investment in the subsidiary and costs incurred after August 3, 2007, from the date of acquisition (August 3, 2007) to October 31, 2007 as the Canadian$ amounts were converted to US$ at the exchange rates prevailing at the two period end dates, and the difference in the rate from the time when costs were incurred during the period of August 3, 2007 to the rate at the close of the period - October 31, 2007, translated to the yearend rate at October 31, 2007. The resulting gain has been credited to comprehensive income.
4.
OIL AND GAS PROPERTY COSTS (continued)
On November 3, 2006, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (“JV Agreement”), which was amended on May 18, 2007, and further amended on March 17, 2008, and on May 24, 2007, the Company entered into an Impact/Benefit Agreement with the Buffalo River Dene Nation (“BRDN”) to explore and develop its traditional lands in northern Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement, the Company is responsible for 100% of the costs to explore and develop any project within the traditional lands. After all costs relating to a specific project have been recouped, the Company will retain a 90% interest and the BRDDC will be entitled to the remaining minority interest of the Project. Furthermore, the BRDDC is entitled to earn up to an additional 20% interest in any project(s) by contributing its pro rata share of the costs to explore and develop any project(s). Even if the BRDDC chooses to participate to the full extent permitted by the JV Agreement, the Company will continue to hold a majority of the working interest in the Project.
Pursuant to the terms of the Impact/Benefit Agreement with the BRDN, the Company is committed to make certain contributions to the BRDN on or before May 24 every year for capacity and infrastructure building and for reimbursement of costs for traditional lands staffing and to support training and development of the BRDN community in the range of Cdn$1,000,000 to Cdn$1,300,000 per year. Additionally, the Company is committed to expend up to Cdn$1,000,000 to assist BRDN forestry contractors to transition to approved contractors for the A10 Project. Finally, the Company is committed to providing a loan of up to Cdn$5,000,000 to assist the BRDDC to fund an increase in ownership of the A10 Project of up to 30% (from the current 10% interest) when production is to commence.
As at October 31, 2008, the Company had paid or accrued a total of approximately Cdn$2,098,500 (approximately US$1,742,200) to the BRDN and is committed to further payments totalling in the aggregate of approximately Cdn$25,000,000 over the term of the agreement which expires in 2027.
The funding provided to the BRDN under the Impact/Benefit Agreement is recoverable to the Company under the JV Agreement before the payment of the BRDN net profit interest. These costs are expensed as incurred, and will be credited to operations when recovered.
During the years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, the Company spent funds to evaluate and to acquire properties with oil and gas potential in northern Saskatchewan and northern Alberta - the Company’s only geographic segment.
During the year ended October 31, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with La Loche Clearwater Development Authority, which requires ratification by the community before it is effective. Such ratification is expected in February 2009. As at October 31, 2008, the Company had paid a total of approximately Cdn$94,200 (approximately US$78,205) in connection with this agreement, and has capitalized these costs as acquisition related costs in oil and gas property costs.
The Company has determined that there is no impairment to its oil and gas property costs based on current conditions. However, it is possible that changes could occur in the near term, which could adversely affect management’s estimates and may result in future write-downs of the capitalized property carrying values.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND LOSS PER SHARE CALCULATION
Preferred and Common Stock
Authorized:
On June 9, 2006, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the authorized share capital (the “Share Increase”) from 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001, to 310,000,000 shares, comprised of 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001. In addition, on May 6, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a 30:1 forward stock split (the “StockSplit”) in the form of a dividend. The record and payment date for the stock dividend was June 21, 2006. Appropriate revisions have been made to the financial statements for the prior fiscal year to reflect the Share Increase and the Stock Split.
The holders of our common stock (i) have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors; (ii) are entitled to share in all of the Company assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; (iii) do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and (iv) are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. The preferred stock is issuable in series upon Board of Director resolution, and the Board of Directors is authorized to establish the relative terms, rights and other privileges of any series of preferred stock. No preferred stock has been issued by the Board of Directors.
Issued:
30,000,000 common shares (post-split) were issued to Alan Teegardin on October 12, 2004 for the sum of $5,000 in cash which were subsequently transferred to Dr. Anchana Chayawatana on November 19, 2004 for the same amount. On May 6, 2006, Dr. Chayawatana sold her 30,000,000 shares to Darren Stevenson. 33,000,000 common shares (post-split) were issued to 29 investors in the Company’s SB-2 offering for the aggregate sum of $55,000 in cash. The Regulation SB-2 offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2005 and completed in March 2005.
Effective August 9, 2006, the Company closed a private placement of Units of its securities. 10,854,700 Units were issued at a price of $1.00 per Unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $10,854,700. The offering was conducted pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws provided by Regulation S and Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Each Unit consisted of one share, on a post-split basis, of the Company’s common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock (the “Warrants”). Each Warrant was exercisable for two years commencing October 1, 2006 and entitles its holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at $3.00 per share. The warrants expired September 30, 2008.
Following the closing of the offering, the funds remained in escrow until a suitable acquisition candidate in the unconventional petroleum industry was identified and acquired. If the Company had failed to complete a business acquisition within 12 months after the closing of the offering, subscription proceeds would have been promptly returned to investors without interest or deduction. The Company completed the acquisition of 75% of Access Energy Inc. on August 3, 2007 (see note 11 below).
On May 6, 2006, the Company issued $1,000,000 of convertible debentures (see note 10 below) to two accredited investors. The Debentures converted into Units on August 9, 2006 at a conversion price of $1.00 per Unit for a total of 1,000,000 Units. Each Unit consisted of one share, on a post-split basis, of the Company’s common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock. Each of these Warrants is exercisable for two years commencing October 1, 2006 and entitles its holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at $3.00 per share. Each of these Warrants expired September 30, 2008.
On November 6, 2006 the Company purchased 30,000,000 shares of common stock from Darren Stevenson for $50,000 cash in accordance with the terms of the stock repurchase agreement. These shares have been cancelled effective January 23, 2009.
5.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND LOSS PER SHARE CALCULATION (continued)
In addition, there are 1,500,000 Warrants outstanding, which were issued as part of the consideration for the purchase of the subsidiary, Access Energy. Referred to as the “Access Warrants”, each of these 1,500,000 Access Warrants is exercisable for five years commencing August 3, 2007 and entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at $2.00 per share. The Access Warrants were granted in consideration for the future acquisition of an additional project other than the A10 Project, which, at the time of the acquisition of Access, and to the date of this report, had not been secured. The Access Warrants do not vest until Access secures an additional project. No value could be attributed to these Access Warrants since no additional project has been secured, and there is no certainty that any additional project will be secured. If and when an additional project is secured, and assuming the Access Warrants have not expired, they will be considered to have vested and we will determine and record the value of the Access Warrants accordingly using the Black-Scholes method. At the time of vesting, we will record the fair value of the Access Warrants as a charge to stock-based compensation expense and a credit to Additional Paid-In Capital.

For the year ended October 31, 2008, 1,500,000 options and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended October 31, 2007, there were 14,054,700 options and warrants excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. From October 12, 2004 (inception) to date, there are 1,500,000 excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
On April 18, 2006, the Company entered into an employment agreement and a stock option agreement with Darren Stevenson. Under the Stock Option Agreement, Mr. Stevenson was, on April 18, 2006, granted options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company on a post-split basis. All of the options, once vested, were exercisable at $2.00 per share. Options expired two years after the date of the grant. Options to purchase 100,000 shares vested on June 9, 2006 when the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation. Options to purchase 200,000 shares vested on August 9, 2006 when the Company completed a common stock placement of US$10,854,700. Options to purchase 200,000 shares vested on January 1, 2007, and options to purchase 500,000 shares were to vest if the Company conducted a placement of at least US$50,000,000. On October 31, 2007, the Company cancelled 500,000 options granted to Mr. Darren Stevenson as part of the termination of his employment agreement as President and CEO. In April 2008, the remaining 500,000 options held by Mr. Stevenson expired.
The Company valued the options issued to Mr. Stevenson at a $0 value based on a closing price of $0.03, an exercise price of $2.00, and an expected time until exercise of 2 years using Black-Scholes. The Company used the average historical volatility of three companies deemed to be in the same industry as the Company as 50.86%. The expected dividend yield assumption used was $0.
On August 1, 2006, the Company entered into a consulting agreement and a Stock Warrant Agreement with Gregg Layton. Under the Stock Warrant Agreement, Mr. Layton received warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock (on a post-split basis as described below) with 50,000 warrants vesting on August 1, 2006. Warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock vested on January 1, 2007, warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock vested August 9, 2006, and warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock would have vested if the Company conducted a placement of at least US$50,000,000. The Company enacted a 30:1 forward stock split on June 9, 2006, and all of the share amounts for which the warrants were exercisable were on a post-split basis. All of the warrants, once vested, were exercisable at $2.00 per share until July 31, 2008. The warrants were cancelled in February 2008 when Mr. Layton’s consulting agreement was terminated.
The Company valued the warrants issued to Mr. Layton at a $21,620 value based on a closing price of $1.00, an exercise price of $2.00, and an expected time until exercise of 2 years, using Black-Scholes. The Company used the average historical volatility of three companies deemed to be in the same industry as the Company as 50.86%. The expected dividend yield assumption used was $0. The Company expensed $8,110 of stock-based compensation related to these warrants in 2008 (2007 - $10,808).
The Company has issued no other options or entered into stock option agreements with any other persons.
As of June 26, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved, and a majority of the Company’s stockholders ratified, the adoption of the Company’s 2006 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”), pursuant to which the Board of Directors has the ability to provide incentives through the issuance of options, stock, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards, representing up to 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, to certain employees, outside directors, officers, consultants and advisors. The 2006 Stock Option Plan allows the term of options granted to be determined by the Board of Directors as long as it does not exceed ten years. The Board of Directors is also authorized to determine the vesting requirements of the options granted.
The Board of Directors approved a revised stock option plan (the “2008 Amended Company Stock Option Plan”) for the Company on February 15, 2008. The 2008 Amended Company Stock Option Plan is subject to stockholder approval. The 2008 Amended Company Stock Option Plan allows the term of options granted to be determined by the Board of Directors as long as it does not exceed ten years. The Board of Directors is also authorized to determine the vesting requirements of the options granted.

STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (continued)
Also on February 15, 2008, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 2,200,000 stock options to officers, directors and consultants of the Company under the 2008 Amended Company Stock Option Plan. These options, to be granted once the Company’s stockholders approve the plan, are exerciseable at $1.90 per share for a term of five years, and have the following vesting provisions:
-
604,166 options vest when the stock price trades at or above $2.50 for ten consecutive trading days; and
-
604,168 options vest when the stock price trades at or above $3.00 for ten consecutive trading days
The options, once granted, will be valued using Black-Scholes, and the resulting expense recorded over the vesting period or vesting conditions.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In addition to transactions disclosed in notes 5 and 6 above with related parties, as of October 31, 2008, there are no significant related party transactions between the Company and any of its officers or directors other than a consulting agreement between the Access and a company controlled by the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company as described below.
On November 1, 2005, Access entered into an agreement with Coniston Investment Corp. (“Coniston”), to provide management, consulting and advisory services to Access (the “Services”). These services include assisting Access in negotiating joint venture agreements, assisting in the formation of a team of technical experts, and other consulting and advisory services as required by Access from time to time. The agreement automatically renews for consecutive one-year terms unless terminated by either party in writing and currently expires October 31, 2009.
Coniston’s sole shareholder, President and CEO is the President and CEO of Access and, effective November 1, 2007, also of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement: (i) Access shall pay Coniston a fee of: (i) Cdn$260,000 per annum, payable monthly (paid); (ii) Cdn$1,000,000 (the “Dene Fee”) in the event Access entered into an agreement with the BRDN and/or its associates or affiliates to develop hydrocarbon opportunities in a defined area within Treaty 10 lands which includes the traditional and historically occupied and used lands of the BRDN (paid); and (iii) Coniston will also be entitled to receive a 1.25% non-convertible overriding royalty based on 100% production (“GORR”) from any and all projects that Coniston brings to Access (the “Royalty Fee”). Amounts are due on demand by Access, are non-interest bearing, and are unsecured. Effective January 1, 2009, the agreement was revised to reflect a reduced fee of Cdn$160,000 per annum, payable monthly. The revised agreement expires October 31, 2009, but automatically renews for consecutive one-year terms unless terminated by either party in writing.
During the year ended October 31, 2008, Coniston charged Access management fees of Cdn$260,000 which is included in the consolidated statement of operations, and Goods and Services Tax owing on management and other fees since Access’ inception of Cdn$118,117 which had been accrued in applicable periods.

ACQUISITION OF ACCESS ENERGY INC. (“ACCESS”)
On August 3, 2007, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), the Company purchased 600 newly issued shares of common stock, of Access, representing 75.0% of its common stock for an aggregate sum of Cdn$3,427,935 (US$3,234,545), and common stock purchase warrants to acquire 1,500,000 Company’s shares of common stock (“Access Warrants”). Prior to the Purchase, the Company was a “shell” company as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. By consummating the Purchase, the Company succeeded at its business plan, which was to enter the unconventional petroleum industry by acquiring a suitable target company. The Company paid the purchase price in four segments: (i) Cdn$3,077,935 in cash; (ii) Cdn$250,000 by offset against the amount held in escrow created on May 17, 2007; (iii) Cdn$100,000 that was paid to Access pursuant to the Exclusivity Agreement; and (iv) the Access Warrants. The Company obtained the cash portion of the purchase price from funds released from the restricted cash held in an escrow account. On August 28, 2007 the balance of restricted cash held in escrow was released and transferred to the Company’s bank account. Blacksands intends to operate Access to continue in the business that Access engaged in prior to the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, no material relationship existed between the Company and Access. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, The results of operating and cash flows of Access are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows from the date of acquisition.

The composition of deferred tax assets/liability is as follows:
For United States and Canadian federal income tax purposes, Blacksands has net operating losses of approximately $2,219,000 at October 31, 2008 (2007 - $1,560,000). For Canadian income tax purposes, Access has net operating losses of approximately $842,000 at October 31, 2008 (2007 - $831,000). These losses expire as follows:

$ 3,061,000
At October 31, 2008, Access had Cdn$5,097,000 (approximately US$4,231,500) of resource deductions for Canadian income tax purposes. At October 31, 2007, Access had Cdn$3,674,300 (approximately US$3,889,200) of resource deductions for Canadian income tax purposes.
The Company is required to file a tax return in the United States, and both the Company and its subsidiary, Access Energy, Inc. (“Access”), file separate tax returns in Canada.
The Company has not filed its federal income tax returns for the years 2004 to 2007, however the compilation and filing is in process. The Company’s subsidiary, Access Energy Inc., has filed all tax returns up to and including October 31, 2007.
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the full tax benefit of the operating loss carryovers and other deferred tax assets relating to oil and gas properties and share issuance costs due to the uncertainty regarding realization.
Further, utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to loss utilization under the U.S. dual consolidated loss rules and limited under U.S. and Canadian change of control rules.
The increase in the valuation allowance for the year amounted to $527,000.
On October 15, 2008, Access signed a Joint Venture Agreement and an Impact Benefit Agreement (the “Agreements”) with La Loche Clearwater Development Authority. The Agreements were subject to the ratification by the aboriginal residents of the area (the La Loche “Community”) before they were effective.
On February 14, 2009, the Community ratified the Joint Venture Agreement and the Impact Benefit Agreement signed by Access and the La Loche Clearwater Development Authority (“LLCDA”) on October 15, 2008.
The Agreements cover approximately 3,000,000 hectares of La Loche Traditional Lands (the “Traditional Lands”) in north western Saskatchewan, north and west of the town of La Loche, Saskatchewan.
The Agreements allow Access to exclusively participate in the acquisition, exploration and development of certain surface and subsurface rights in and to the Traditional Lands with respect to petroleum and mining products (the “Products”).
The terms of the Agreements are for twenty years from the date of signing (October 15, 2008), and automatically renew for consecutive terms of twenty years if Access provides notice of renewal to LLCDA before the expiration of the Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, Access paid Cdn$15,000 (approximately US$12,500) on the signing of the Agreements, and is obligated to pay to the LLCDA Cdn$75,000 (approximately US$62,300) at the start of each three-month period upon ratification of the Agreements (or Cdn$300,000 annually - approximately US$249,000). As well, Access is obligated to pay a 5% gross overriding royalty to LLCDA from the production of any Products.
With the ratification of the Joint Venture Agreement and Impact Benefit Agreement between Access and LLCDA, Access is considered to have secured another project, and the 1,500,000 “Access Warrants” referred to in Note 5 have vested, and will be accounted for in the year ended October 31, 2009.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(e) and Rule 15(d) - 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation and in light of the discussion of the material weakness discussed below in the Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In order to remediate the material weakness, management has instituted the controls set forth in the Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has designed such internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management has used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, which is a suitable, recognized control framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2008 due to a material weakness identified by management in the understanding and application of
U.S. GAAP , including but not limited to oil and gas accounting and foreign currency translation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
More specifically, the material weakness relates to a lack of sufficient personnel with appropriate knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP resulting in a lack of sufficient analysis and documentation of the application of U.S. GAAP to transactions, including but not limited to oil and gas accounting and foreign currency translation.
In efforts to address this material weakness, the Company is taking the following remedial actions: (i) providing additional training and education for our accounting staff with respect to U.S. GAAP; and (ii) consulting with external professional expertise on an earlier basis with respect to interpretation issues with U.S. GAAP.
This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter and the period covered by this annual report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Whistleblower Policy
As a public company, the integrity, transparency and accountability of the financial, administrative and management practices of the Company are critical. Accordingly in October 2008, we adopted a Whistleblower Policy. This policy can be found on our website at www.blacksandspetroleum.com in our document “Corporate Governance Policies - October 27, 2008”, and in our Form 8-K filing of October 29, 2008, and it is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 14.2.
Board Committees
Our Board of Directors has established three board committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance Committee.
The Company does not have a nominating committee. The Board seeks qualified candidates to serve on the Board when needed, and handles all director nominating and approval. The Board, at its discretion, could ask the Corporate Governance Committee to seek and nominate qualified candidates on the Board’s behalf.
The information below sets out the current members of each of Blacksands’ board committees and summarizes the functions of each of the committees in accordance with their mandates.
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Experts
The Audit Committee was formed in August 2007 with the sole independent director at the time, Mr. Bruno Mosimann, being the sole member of the Audit Committee. Mr. Holcombe joined the Audit Committee after joining the board November 1, 2007. Our Audit Committee is currently comprised of Mark Holcombe and Bruno Mosimann, both of whom are independent directors under the Audit Committee rules of the NYSE Alternext US. Mark Holcombe is the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Mark Holcombe satisfies the criteria for an audit committee financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Audit Committee meets with management and Blacksands’ external auditors to review matters affecting financial reporting, the system of internal accounting and financial controls and procedures, and the audit procedures and audit plans. The Audit Committee reviews Blacksands’ significant financial risks, will be involved in the appointment of senior financial executives, and will annually review Blacksands’ insurance coverage and any off-balance sheet transactions.
The Audit Committee is mandated to monitor Blacksands’ audit and the preparation of financial statements and to review and recommend to the board of directors all financial disclosure contained in Blacksands’ public documents. The Audit Committee is also mandated to appoint external auditors, monitor their qualifications and independence and determine the appropriate level of their remuneration. The external auditors report directly to the Audit Committee and to the board of directors. The Audit Committee and board of directors each have the authority to terminate the external auditor’s engagement (subject to confirmation by stockholders). The Audit Committee will also approve in advance any services to be provided by the external auditors which are not related to the audit.
A copy of the Audit Committee charter can be found within the “Corporate Governance Policies - October 27, 2008” on the Company’s website at www.blacksandspetroleum.com, and also included in our Form 8-K filing of October 29, 2008. It is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 14.2.
Additional information relating to the Audit Committee is contained in the following sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2008: “Item 9 - Directors and Executive Officers” and “Item 14 - Principal Accountant Fees and Services”.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee was formed in August 2007, and comprised our sole independent director at that time, Bruno Mosimann. At a meeting of the Board of Directors on October 27, 2008, Mark Holcombe, our other independent director, was added to the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors also approved Terms of Reference for the Compensation Committee which are included in “Corporate Governance Policies - October 27, 2008” available on our website at www.blacksandspetroleum.com, and filed on Form 8-K on EDGAR, and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 14.2. There were no meetings held by the Compensation Committee in the year ended October 31, 2008, and any compensation discussions and matters relating to employment and compensation of Directors and executive officers were dealt with by the full Board of Directors, with Directors or executive officers abstaining from voting as matters related to their positions with the Company specifically. To the extent that matters are not dealt with by the full Board of the Directors, the Compensation Committee has the mandate to review both the overall salary objectives of Blacksands, and significant modifications made to employee benefit plans, including those applicable to directors and executive officers, and propose any awards of stock options, incentive and deferred compensation benefits, as applicable.
Corporate Governance Committee
The Corporate Governance Committee was recently formed on October 27, 2008, and includes Paul Parisotto, Mark Holcombe, and Bruno Mosimann. It did not have any meetings in the year ended October 31, 2008. Two of three Committee members are independent, in accordance with the Company’s Corporate Governance Committee’s Terms of Reference. The Corporate Governance Committee is charged with the responsibility of assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to the corporate governance practices and policies of the Company, and assessing the functioning and effectiveness of the Board, its committees, and its individual members.
We intend to appoint such persons to existing and future committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges at such time, if ever, we become subject to such requirements. Therefore, we intend that a majority of our directors will eventually be independent directors and at least one director will continue to qualify as an “audit committee financial expert.”
None of our executive officers or key employees is related by blood, marriage or adoption to any other director or executive officer.
To our knowledge, there is no arrangement or understanding between any of our officers and any other person pursuant to which the officer was selected to serve as an officer.

Agreements With Officers, Directors And Consultants
Paul Parisotto
Mr. Parisotto is the President and sole director and stockholder of Coniston Investment Corp. (“Coniston”). Effective November 1, 2005, the management services agreement between Coniston and Access Energy Inc. calls for Coniston to be paid Cdn$260,000 per year, plus the applicable goods and services tax, for management, consulting and advisory services on matters with respect to the acquisition, exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons in western Canada and United States. It also contains a change of control provision which provides that if a change of control were to occur without Coniston’s prior consent, Access would owe Coniston an additional Cdn$135,000. The Purchase of 75% of the shares of Access Energy by Blacksands constituted a change of control to which Coniston consented to in advance. The Coniston Agreement terminates annually on October 31st, but is automatically renewed for one year periods unless one party provides at least 60 days’ prior notice of non-renewal. No such notice has been provided as of October 28, 2008, and the agreement was renewed.
During the year ended October 31, 2008, Coniston charged Access management fees of Cdn$260,000 which is included in the consolidated statement of operations, and Goods and Services Tax owing on management and other fees since Access’ inception of Cdn$118,117 which had been accrued in applicable periods. During the period from
August 3, 2007 (date of acquisition of Access) to October 31, 2007, Coniston charged Access management fees of Cdn$68,900 including GST which is included in the consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended October 31, 2008, Coniston charged Access expenses relating to acquisition and development of projects in the amount of Cdn$152,881. For the year ended October 31, 2007, additional oil and gas property investigation fees and out-of-pocket expenses of Cdn$423,467, as well as the Dene Fee of Cdn$1,000,000 plus 6% GST were charged by Coniston during the year ended October 31, 2007. Of these, $1,000,000 was included in Oil and Gas property costs, and the balance charged to operations. Amounts payable to Coniston of Cdn$57,408 (US$47,660) were recorded to the end of October 31, 2008 (2007 - Cdn$229,822 or US$243,267).
Coniston is also entitled to a 1.25% nonconvertible overriding royalty based on 100% production from A10 Project’s production. Coniston will receive this royalty and other success fees as it may negotiate with Access for future projects where it is fundamental to the consummation of a similar project with us or Access. The royalty is governed by Article 3 of the 1997 Canadian Association of Petroleum Landmen Farmout & Royalty Procedure, which sets forth many standard contract terms used in connection with development and management of petroleum producing properties.
Neither Mr. Parisotto nor Coniston have a separate agreement with Blacksands for Mr. Parisotto’s services as President and CEO of Blacksands.

The Board proposed stock grants to certain directors and executives to provide additional compensation in February 2008 under the amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan - such amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan is to be approved at the next annual general meeting of stockholders.
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS
We have one equity compensation plan: the 2006 Stock Option Plan. This plan has been approved by our stockholders. Amendments to the 2006 Stock Option Plan will be presented to our stockholders for approval at the Annual Meeting and are described below under the heading “Amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan”.
2006 Stock Option Plan
On June 26, 2006, our Board of Directors and the holders of a majority (55.2%) of our then outstanding common stock approved our 2006 Stock Option Plan (the “2006 Plan”). The purpose of the 2006 Plan is to provide an incentive to attract and retain directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees whose services are considered valuable, to encourage a sense of proprietorship and to stimulate an active interest of such persons into our development and financial success. Under the 2006 Plan, we are authorized to issue incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock. The 2006 Plan is administered by our Board of Directors. As of the date of this report, there were no stock options outstanding under the 2006 Plan.
Securities Authorized for Issuance
We have no other equity compensation plans in place that have not been approved by our stockholders, but amendments will be presented to stockholders for approval at the annual meeting as the amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan. The table below shows securities issued under our existing equity compensation plans as of October 31, 2008:

The amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan, to be approved by the stockholders at the 2008 Annual Meeting, is described in further detail below.
AMENDED 2008 COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLAN
BENEFIT PLANS
The following summarizes the amended 2008 Company Stock Option Plan (the “2008 Plan”) subject to stockholder action at the 2008 Annual Meeting.
SUMMARY OF THE 2008 PLAN
The following summary of the Company’s 2008 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2008 Plan, a copy of which is filed with our Schedule 14A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2008.
The 2008 Plan provides for the grant of stock options to eligible persons, as determined by the Board in accordance with the 2008 Plan. Stockholders approval will make available a maximum of 10% of the aggregate number of shares outstanding for purchase upon exercise of options granted under the 2008 Plan. However, the aggregate number of shares available for “Incentive Stock Options,” which are options that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), is 4,485,470. The term of the 2008 Plan is to be determined by the Board, however in no event may an Incentive Stock Option be granted more than ten years from the date the 2008 Plan was adopted. No options may be granted under the 2008 Plan if there are no shares available to issue.
Stock options may be granted to any director, officer or employee of the Company or any subsidiary or any consultant or advisor of the Company or any subsidiary. Incentive Stock options granted to “U.S. Participants” are governed under a separate set of rules, contained in the 2008 Plan. A “U.S. Participant” is an employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor, or director of the Company (or of any parent or subsidiary of the Company) who
participates in the 2008 Plan and who is either a citizen of the U.S. or a resident alien of the U.S. for purposes of the Code. A “non-U.S. Participant” is an employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor, or director of the Company (or of any parent or subsidiary of the Company) who participates in the 2008 Plan but who is not a U.S. Participant.
FU.S. Participants (as defined above) may receive two types of options: (1) Incentive Stock Options, which are options that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code, and (2) Nonqualified Stock Options. No option may be granted at a price less than the fair market value measured on the date of the grant. However, only employees of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company may receive Incentive Stock Options.
The 2008 Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors. The Committee will have authority to interpret, construe, amend, suspend or terminate the 2008 Plan. A written agreement will evidence each option and, in the case of U.S. Participants, state whether the option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
The Board will have the power to determine expiration date of each option, provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options granted to U.S. Participants will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant, and no Incentive Stock Option granted to a greater-than-ten-percent stockholders will expire later than five years from the date of grant. Generally, vested options will terminate upon the first to occur of: (1) expiration of the option; (2) thirty days following the optionee’s termination of employment, other than as a result of death or disability; or (3) six months following the optionee’s death or cessation of employment by reason of disability. However, Incentive Stock Options granted to U.S. Participants are subject to a special set of rules regarding termination as set forth in the 2008 Plan.
Upon a change in control, the Board shall have the right, upon written notice thereof to each optionee holding options under the plan, to permit the exercise of all such options prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on that date which is twenty (20) days following the date of such notice or (ii) the close of business on the expiration date of the option. The purchase price of option shares must be paid in full by cash or check to the Company’s principal office.
The 2008 Plan will only be effective upon approval of the majority of the stockholders. 2,200,000 options have been granted under the 2008 Plan subject to stockholder approval of the 2008 Plan. The options are exerciseable at $1.90 per share for a term of five years from February 15, 2008. 991,666 options vested immediately; 604,166 options vest when the stock price trades at or above $2.50 for ten consecutive trading days and 604,168 options vest when the stock price trades at or above $3.00 for ten consecutive trading days. The closing price of a share of the Company’s Common Stock, as reported on the OTCBB on January 28, 2009, was $0.13 US.
The Plan is not subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not qualified under Code Section 401(a).
U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
The following is a summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to U.S. Participants in the 2008 Plan. This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to non-U.S. Participants.
Options. The grant of an option should not result in any taxable income for the recipient. The holder of an Incentive Stock Option generally will have no taxable income upon exercising the Incentive Stock Option (except that an alternative minimum tax liability may result), and the Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction when an Incentive Stock Option is exercised. Upon exercising a Non-Qualified Stock Option, a U.S. Participant must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Company common stock acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price, and the Company will be entitled at that time to a tax deduction for the same amount.
The tax consequence to a U.S. Participant upon a disposition of shares of Company common stock acquired through the exercise of an option will depend on how long the shares have been held and whether the shares were acquired by exercising an Incentive Stock Option or by exercising a Non-Qualified Stock Option. Generally, there will be no
tax consequences to the Company in connection with the disposition of shares acquired pursuant to an option. However, the Company may be entitled to a tax deduction in the case of a disposition of shares acquired pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option before the applicable Incentive Stock Option holding periods set forth in the Code have been satisfied.
Special Rules. Special rules may apply in the case of individuals subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. In particular, unless a special election is made pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code, shares of Company common stock received pursuant to the exercise of an option may be treated as restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a period of up to six months after the date of exercise. Accordingly, the amount of any ordinary income recognized, and the amount of the Company’s tax deduction, may be determined as of the end of such period.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation Under Code Section 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits to $1,000,000 the amount that a publicly-held corporation is allowed each year to deduct for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the compensation paid to the chief executive officer and certain of the corporation’s most highly compensated executive officers (“Covered Employees”). However, “qualified performance-based qualified compensation” is not subject to the $1,000,000 deduction limit. Options granted pursuant to a plan designed to permit option awards to qualify as performance based compensation are not subject to the $1,000,000 deduction limitation. The 2008 Plan has not been designed to permit grants of options issued under the 2008 Plan to qualify under the performance-based compensation rules so that if the Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, the income attributable to the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option by Covered Employees will be subject to the $1,000,000 deduction limit.
ACCOUNTING TREATMENT
The applicable accounting treatment for options granted under the 2008 Option Plan is set forth in SFAS 123R which replaced SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and superseded APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, and employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R. Under this standard, the Company recognizes compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the Company’s employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plans. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the option vesting periods.

•

(1) Stock options were approved by the Board of Directors in February 2008 but have not been granted. See Equity Compensation Plans above.
(2) The value of unexercised “in the money” options is determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to such options by the difference between the exercise price per share and the closing bid of our Common Stock on The OTC Bulletin Board on October 31, 2008, if applicable.
The Company is not aware of any stockholder who beneficially owns 5% of more of the Company’s stock.
ITEM 13.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Mr. Parisotto is the President and sole Director and Stockholder of Coniston which provides consulting services to Access. As of November 1, 2007, Mr. Parisotto is the President of Blacksands. As part of the purchase price, Coniston was paid approximately Cdn$1,948,000 (approximately US$1.87 million). Cdn$1,060,000 was a success fee payable upon Access’ entry into the Joint Venture Agreement and Amendment with the BRDN. The remainder was accrued and unpaid consulting fees and expenses. No payments of principal were made before payment in full and no interest was charged on the unpaid balance, as the oral arrangement was that it would be paid when Access had the available funds.
Coniston is also entitled to a 1.25% nonconvertible overriding royalty based on 100% production when and if A10 Project commences production. Coniston is also entitled to receive this royalty and other success fees as it may negotiate with Access for future projects where it is fundamental to the consummation of a similar project with us or Access. It is impossible to quantify the present dollar value of Coniston’s royalty interest since a great deal of additional exploration will be required for us to begin preparing a plan for production and the uncertainty associated with any petroleum development.
Mr. Burden currently owns 25% of Access’ issued and outstanding common stock. Prior to the Purchase, Mr. Burden was the sole stockholder of Access. We are required to provide the necessary capital for Access’ operations until it has sufficient cash flow to do so itself. Thus, Mr. Burden benefits from the growth of Access both as a result of our capital infusions and Access’ cash flow over time. It is impossible to quantify the present dollar value of these capital contributions.
An “independent” director is a director whom the Board of Directors has determined satisfies the requirements for independence under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, section 10A(m)(3) and under section 121A of the NYSE Alternext US Company Guide. Mr. Mosimann and Mr. Holcombe satisfy these requirements for independence.
ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES
Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”) serves as our independent registered public accounting firm for the Company as of September 17, 2008. Prior to that, Sherb & Co., LLP served as our principal accountant.
Audit Fees
Our principal accountant, Ernst & Young, LLP (“Ernst & Young”), did not bill us any aggregate fees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, and Sherb & Co. LLP (“Sherb”), our previous independent accountants, billed us approximately $33,000 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007. Sherb also billed the Company $5,000 for support of the transition of the principal accountant to Ernst & Young.
We expect additional billings from Sherb of approximately $25,000 for further transitional issues, their fee for inclusion of their 2007 audit report in this Form 10-K, and other audit matters.
We have accrued approximately $83,000 as aggregate fees expected from Ernst & Young, LLP for the professional services that Ernst & Young provided for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our report on 10-K. The amounts billed by Sherb are for the audit of our annual and financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our report for October 31, 2007, on 10-KSB.
Audit-Related Fees
Sherb billed us aggregate fees in the amount of $28,000 for the review of the financial statements included in our report on 10-Q for the year ended October 31, 2008 ($17,000 for the year ended October 31, 2007 for our reports on 10-QSB). Sherb billed us aggregate fees in the amount of $4,500 for the year ended October 31, 2008 for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and/or Form 8K filings and $6,500 for the review of the financial statements included in our report on 8-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007).
Ernst & Young is our principal auditor as of September 17, 2008, and will bill us for the reviews of our financial statements included in our reports on 10-Q in the future.
Tax Fees
Sherb billed us $nil for tax compliance for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2008 and $nil for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, Sherb did not provide any tax advice. Ernst & Young will be providing us with tax compliance services for the period from inception (October 12, 2004) to October 31, 2008 inclusive.
All Other Fees
Sherb billed us $nil in other fees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008 and $nil for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 for other fees. Our principal accountant (through its full time employees) performed all work regarding the audit of our financial statements for the most recent fiscal year.
Audit Committee’s Pre-Approval Practice
Section 10A(i) of the Exchange Act prohibits our auditors from performing audit services for us as well as any services not considered to be “audit services” unless such services are pre-approved by the audit committee of the Board of Directors, or unless the services meet certain de minimis standards. The audit committee’s charter (amended and included with the Company’s Corporate Governance Policies approved by the Board of Directors on October 27, 2008, filed on October 29, 2008, and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10.15) provides that the audit committee must:
•
Preapprove all audit services that the auditor may provide to us or any subsidiary (including, without limitation, providing comfort letters in connection with securities underwritings or statutory audits) as required by §10A(i)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002); and
•
Preapprove all non-audit services (other than certain de minimis services described in §10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002)) that the auditors propose to provide to us or any of our subsidiaries. The audit committee considers at each of its meetings whether to approve any audit services or non-audit services. In some cases, management may present the request; in other cases, the auditors may present the request.
