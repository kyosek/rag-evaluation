ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
The Company's worldwide headquarters are located in Kirkland, Washington. Mine offices are located in or near Smithers, British Columbia; Yellowknife, Northwest Territories; Timmins, Ontario; and Hope Brook, Newfoundland.
SUMMARY OF MINEABLE (PROVEN AND PROBABLE) ORE RESERVES
Future production is contingent on available mineable ore reserves. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements". Ore reserves were estimated by the Company at December 31, 1996, using anticipated operating costs and C$527 (US$390) per ounce as the projected price of gold.
SUMMARY OF MINERALIZED MATERIAL
The following table presents mineralized material by property as of December 31, 1996. Mineralized material is estimated by the Company. This mineralized material has not been included in the mineable ore reserve estimates because even though enough inspection, sampling and measurement has been done to indicate sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further exploration or development expenditures, these resources do not qualify under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission standards as commercially mineable orebodies until further drilling, metallurgical work, and other economic and technological feasibility factors based upon such work are resolved.
For details concerning the total cost of property, plant and equipment at each of the sites, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
BRITISH COLUMBIA DIVISION
KEMESS SOUTH
BACKGROUND
The Kemess South Project is located 182 miles northwest of Mackenzie, British Columbia, and to the east of Thutade Lake. Currently, access to the area is by air from Smithers or Prince George to the airstrip on site (a 5,225 foot gravel strip), or from the south via an all-weather road from Fort St. James or Mackenzie.
In May 1993, Royal Oak acquired 39% of Geddes, a company whose only significant asset was a 100% interest in a block of mineral claims located in the vicinity of Windy Craggy mountain in northwestern British Columbia. In June 1993, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it would permanently protect, as a provincial park, the region which included Windy Craggy, and would provide compensation for holders of mineral claims in the area. Subsequently, in December 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the Tatshenshini- Alsek Provincial Park, which includes Windy Craggy, a World Heritage site.
In May 1995, the British Columbia provincial government commenced active negotiations with senior officers of Geddes pertaining to compensation respecting Windy Craggy. In order to facilitate such negotiations, Royal Oak indicated to the British Columbia provincial government a willingness to purchase the Kemess and Red Mountain properties and to develop these properties, provided appropriate project support and investment arrangements were provided by the British Columbia provincial government.
In January 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of Geddes, El Condor and St. Philips. The remaining outstanding shares of Geddes were acquired for shares of the Company and cash with a total acquisition cost of $40.9 million; the outstanding shares of El Condor were acquired for shares of the Company and cash worth $110.6 million; and the outstanding shares of St. Philips were acquired for $38.6 million in cash. El Condor and St. Philips owned the Kemess South property and El Condor owned the Kemess North property. These properties are now owned by Kemess Mines Inc. (formerly Geddes Resources Limited). Although the Company will continue to evaluate the potential of the Kemess North property, there is presently no plan to develop this property until mining is well underway on Kemess South.
On April 29, 1996, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it had issued a Project Approval Certificate for the Kemess South Project which entitled the Company to proceed with permitting applications for construction of a mine site and attendant infrastructure and since then, all of the necessary permits material to construction have been granted. Federal approval under the Environmental Assessment Act (Canada) and the Fisheries Act (Canada) was received on November 6, 1996, and will facilitate completion of all infrastructure impacting on viable lakes and streams in the project area.
TIMETABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT
Construction of the Kemess South Project commenced in July 1996 and is anticipated to be completed in April of 1998. The construction phase currently employs a work force of approximately 350 persons and is expected to peak at 650 to 700 persons.
The engineering of the processing facilities, which commenced in November 1995, was completed in February of 1997. Teshmont Consultants Inc. of Winnipeg is managing construction of the power line and Knight Piesold Ltd. has designed the tailings dam.
COMPENSATION, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND INVESTMENT
The Company currently estimates that its total capital costs for the Kemess South Project will be approximately $390 million plus the land acquisition cost. The net book value of the property, plant and equipment of the Company's British Columbia operations which include the Kemess South Project, was approximately $271.9 million as of December 31, 1996.
The Company expects to bring the Kemess South Project into production in the second quarter of 1998. The project development will be facilitated by up to $166 million of economic assistance, investment and compensation from the British Columbia provincial government as described below. The Company is not obligated to repay the British Columbia provincial government any of such amounts. Section 25 of the Financial Administration Act (British Columbia) provides that, notwithstanding the commitment to pay, any payment of money by the British Columbia provincial government pursuant to an agreement is subject to (i) an appropriation being available for that agreement in the year in which the payment falls due and (ii) the Treasury Board not having controlled or limited expenditure under any such appropriation.
The compensation, financial assistance and investment of up to $166 million to be provided by the British Columbia provincial government consist of the following components described below:
(i) Compensation - $29 million payable over two years. On April 15, 1996, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Kemess Mines Inc., received the first of two equal compensation payments of $14.5 million. The final payment is due in April 1997.
(ii) Royalty interest investment - $50 million to develop on and off-site mine infrastructure for the Kemess South Project. The Company will pay the British Columbia provincial government a royalty of 4.8% on all copper extracted and processed from the Kemess South Project.
(iii) Power line installation - $49 million payable over three years to cover the cost of constructing a 380 kilometre power line from the Kennedy substation to the Kemess Mine site together with related equipment. The Company is evaluating alternate sources to supply the power. The power line will be owned and operated by the Company for at least 20 years.
(iv) Regional resource infrastructure - $14 million payable over 14 years for emergency health facilities, airport facilities and for developing and maintaining a connector road.
(v) Human resource development program - $4.0 million payable over two years to facilitate recruitment, selection, relocation, mobility, training, upgrading and safety training for personnel working at the Kemess South Project.
(vi) Mining development - $20 million to be matched dollar for dollar for the development of properties in British Columbia, including the Kemess and Red Mountain properties and extensions.
(vii) Facilitation and support - The British Columbia provincial government agreed to facilitate and support the Company with respect to the negotiation of appropriate contracts of rail transport, port and power charges and to facilitate the review and consideration of the development of the orebody and construction of mining and processing facilities relating to the project pursuant to all applicable legislative, environmental, permitting and other governmental requirements.
The compensation, financial assistance and investment outlined above are documented in a legally binding Heads of Agreement signed on August 18, 1995. This agreement contemplated that the provisions of the Heads of Agreement would be embodied in a formal agreement to be negotiated between the parties. This formal agreement is currently being negotiated. Part of the monies owed pursuant to the Heads of Agreement has been deferred until the formal agreement is signed. Signing of the formal agreement is expected in the second quarter of 1997.
OWNERSHIP
The Kemess property consists of 311 staked mineral claims in three distinct groups that cover approximately 71,718 acres. The Kemess South property was owned by El Condor and St. Philips, and the Kemess North property was owned by El Condor. The property was transferred to Kemess Mines Inc. pursuant to the winding up of El Condor and St. Philips. The Company will pay the British Columbia provincial government a royalty of 4.8% on all copper extracted and processed from the Kemess South Project. In addition, there are two royalty agreements that affect a small number of claims.
GEOLOGY
The Kemess South deposit is a large low grade gold-copper porphyry-type deposit. It is hosted by a flat-lying porphyritic quartz monzodiorite intrusion. Pyrite, the dominant sulphide, occurs as veins and fracture coatings accompanying quartz stringers. Chalcopyrite occurs as disseminated grains and in quartz stockwork veins. Native gold is included within or is peripheral to grains of chalcopyrite, and gold grades correlate closely with those of copper in the hypogene zone.
The highest grade of gold and copper mineralization correlate with zones of intense quartz stockwork development.
A supergene zone, comprising 20% of the deposit, formed during a period of weathering synchronous with the formation of the Late Cretaceous Sustut Basin. Copper grades within this zone are locally leached or enriched, while gold concentrations remain relatively unchanged. Native copper is the dominant secondary copper mineral except at the base of the supergene zone where chalcocite becomes increasingly abundant.
MINING AND MILLING
The development plan contemplates that the deposit will be mined at an average rate of approximately 107,000 tons per day at an estimated cost of $1.56 per ton. Milling at the rate of approximately 50,000 tons per day is projected to cost approximately $1.81 per ton. At this mining rate, the life of the project is estimated to be approximately 16 years. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
ORE RESERVES
Ore reserves for the Kemess South Project were calculated in a 1993 pre- feasibility study completed by Kilborn Engineering Pacific Ltd., for El Condor and St. Philips, the former owners of the property. These reserves were reviewed by Royal Oak prior to the purchase of the property in 1995. In addition, they were independently verified for the Company in February, 1996. Reserves for this property are 221 million tons of ore averaging 0.018 ounces per ton of gold and 0.224% copper. These reserve estimates contain allowances for mining losses and dilution, but not for losses in milling. Net smelter return calculations were carried out on mineralization at Kemess South in order to determine the value that would be returned from mining and processing. These estimates included all transportation and smelter charges. The prices of gold and copper used in the above feasibility studies were US$350 per ounce and US$1.00 per pound, respectively, with an exchange rate of US$0.78/Cdn $1.00.
RED MOUNTAIN
BACKGROUND
The Red Mountain project area is located in the Coastal Mountain Range, 11 miles east of the seaport of Stewart, in northwestern British Columbia. Currently, access to the property is by helicopter from Stewart, however, a road has been constructed to a potential portal site in Bitter Creek adjacent to the ore zone but at a lower elevation.
OWNERSHIP
The property consists of 160 staked mining claims that cover 93,791 acres. The Company acquired 100% of the Red Mountain property from Barrick Gold for one dollar and the obligation to spend $3 million on the property. The Company assumed all past environmental liabilities, estimated at $3.0 million, as part of this purchase. The Company expended $8.0 million on a surface and underground development program which was completed in late 1996, thereby fulfilling its expenditure obligation. The prior owner is entitled to receive a 1% net smelter return royalty on all production from a portion of the property, and on production over 1.85 million ounces of gold, an additional $10.00 per ounce of gold is payable. In addition, the Company is required to pay a 2.5% net smelter return royalty to a third party.
GEOLOGY
The Red Mountain orebody is a hydrothermal gold deposit related to a multiphase intrusion. The Red Mountain area is underlain by Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Hazelton Group. Early Jurassic plutons, sills and dykes have intruded this volcanic-sedimentary assemblage, the largest of which (the Goldslide-Hillslide intrusion) lies beneath Red Mountain. The orebody currently consists of three northwest plunging, southwest dipping elliptical zones located beneath the summit approximately at the contact between two phases of the Goldslide intrusion and hosted within both the stratified sediments and the Hillslide intrusion. Both the ore zones and the host rocks have been disrupted by northwest plunging folds and at least two phases of brittle faulting.
An extensive surface and underground drilling program was completed in 1996. The drilling showed that the JW Zone was truncated to the north by faulting or folding. However, drilling intersected Red Mountain type mineralization closer to the valley floor within a zone now called the SF Zone situated 1,000 feet below and 1,000 feet due north of the JW Zone. The short field season prevented sufficient drilling to fully define the SF Zone's extent and grade.
MINING AND MILLING
It is estimated that over US$30 million was spent by former owners of this property, Lac Minerals and Barrick Gold, between 1991 and 1994 outlining and developing the Marc, AV and JW Zones, which included 300,000 feet of drilling. These zones remain open down-plunge and the exploration potential for the area north of the deposit is deemed by the Company to be excellent.
It is expected that the Red Mountain mine will be operated as an underground mine. The source of power for this property is expected to be British Columbia Hydro.
ORE RESERVES
The Red Mountain deposit contains 800,000 ounces of gold in the mineable category, grading 0.262 ounces of gold per ton.
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES DIVISION
COLOMAC MINE
Selected Operating Data
BACKGROUND
The Colomac Mine, which is located approximately 137 miles northwest of Yellowknife in the vicinity of Indin Lake, was acquired in April 1993 from Neptune Resources Corp. ("Neptune") after having been shut down since June 1991. Stripping operations at the Colomac Mine recommenced in March 1994, and the first gold production was realized in July 1994. As of December 31, 1996, the Colomac Mine and the nearby Cass deposit had mineable ore reserves of 261,000 ounces of gold and additional mineralized material of 237,000 ounces of gold. The property is accessible by winter road from Yellowknife for approximately three months each year or on a year round basis by chartered aircraft to a 5,000 foot airstrip at the mine site. The Cass property which is located 9 miles southwest of the Colomac Mine is expected to provide feed for the Colomac Mill in 1997.
OWNERSHIP
The Colomac property is comprised of 4 mining leases and 3 surface leases which cover approximately 3,400 acres. In 1993, the Company acquired the Colomac Mine and surrounding properties in exchange for shares of Royal Oak worth $7,875,000. In a simultaneous transaction, the Company acquired the gross production royalty on the Colomac property in exchange for shares of Royal Oak worth $4,000,000. The Company holds a 100% interest in the leases. The mining leases are subject to an operating royalty payable to Neptune, when the average price of gold for a calendar year exceeds US$400 per ounce. Amounts payable are $1.0 million or $2.0 million annually depending on the average price of gold. No amount has been payable under this royalty to date. Obligations under this agreement expire after five years of production, which is currently expected to be reached at the end of 1999. The net book value of the Colomac property, plant and equipment was approximately $31.6 million as of December 31, 1996.
The Cass property consists of 12 leased mining claims covering approximately 15,322 acres, and accessible from Colomac by an all-weather road that was constructed in 1996.
In 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Echo Bay Mines Ltd. as operator of a joint venture pursuant to which the joint venture granted the Company an option to acquire up to a 100% interest in the Kim-Cass property, exclusive of diamond rights, by placing the property into production within a four year period. The Company is obligated to incur minimum annual exploration expenses of $250,000 on the property during the four-year earn-in period and has the right to extend the earn-in period for consideration of $100,000 per year. Upon the Company placing the Kim-Cass property into production, the property will be subject to a net smelter return royalty which will be on a sliding scale based on the price of gold. The Company has spent over $1.0 million for exploration on the property to date, which spending satisfies the option requirements.
A $2.0 million exploration program will be implemented at Colomac and its surrounding properties in 1997. The program will focus on drill testing for underground mineable ore.
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Colomac Mine uses conventional open pit mining techniques. The mill, built in 1989, is a conventional 9,300 tons per day CIP circuit with historical recoveries of approximately 90%. The mill circuity was modified, including installation of a pebble crusher bypass in 1996, to overcome operating difficulties and to facilitate the processing of 10,000 tpd of ore. The plant and equipment are generally in good to excellent condition. The design of the open pit was carried out with computer-aided mine design software which allows for block model generation, reserve calculation and interactive pit design. The power for this property is diesel-generated on site.
GEOLOGY
The Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Pre-Cambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Cass Zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996, the Colomac operation, including its satellite deposit, the Cass Zone, had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of approximately 5,292,000 tons grading 0.049 ounces of gold per ton. The cutoff grade used in estimating these reserves of 0.030 ounces of gold per ton for the open pit is based on current mining costs and a gold price of $527 (US$390) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
GIANT MINE
BACKGROUND
The Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in production continuously since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all- weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the centre of the property. Mining is conducted underground and the ore is processed with an on-site mill. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7,000,000 ounces of gold.
In 1996 the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure which accesses the Supercrest orebody and large scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 ounces of gold per ton in situ compared to 0.301 ounces of gold per ton at Giant. The net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $52.5 million as of December 31, 1996.
The Nicholas Lake property, which was acquired in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife. It can be accessed by chartered aircraft from Yellowknife or by winter road. Currently, development studies are being undertaken and production is not expected to commence before 1999 at the earliest. The Company plans to mine ore year round and to stockpile at site, for shipment to the Giant Mine in Yellowknife on the winter ice road. The ore will be processed at the Giant facility. The Nicholas Lake deposit is expected to be mined at 200 to 300 tons per day. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
OWNERSHIP
The Company owns 100% interest in the Giant Mine property (which includes Supercrest), consisting of 6 mining leases covering 1,636 acres and one surface lease covering 2,243 acres.
The Company purchased 100% interest in the Nicholas Lake property in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., for $3.8 million. The Nicholas Lake property is subject to a 1% net smelter return royalty.
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Giant Mine operates as an underground mine with access provided by two large service raises, five declines and the "C" shaft, which is the principal operating opening for hoisting, extending to a depth of 2,124 feet. Mining is by conventional underground mining techniques such as cut and fill. The mine is mechanized with jumbo drills and 3-1/2 yard scooptrams. The mill at the Giant Mine is a 1,100 ton per day milling and refining complex. The mine operates on a five day a week schedule while the mill operates seven days a week. The power source for this property is Northwest Territories Power Corp. Power costs have increased significantly in the last several years and the Company is investigating alternative sources of providing power.
The Nicholas Lake orebody consists of eleven zones of mineralization. These zones are near vertical quartz-sulphide veins. The zones have been drilled from surface and underground at a spacing of approximately 65 feet. The orebody is accessed by a ramp (driven in 1994) to a depth of 300 feet below surface. A total of 750 feet of cross-cutting and silling has been conducted on two of the major zones (including detailed mapping and sampling). Mining methods during the production phase will be shrinkage. Access will be provided by deepening the existing ramp as mining progresses.
The main infrastructure of the Giant Mine has been in place since 1946. An Edwards Hearth roaster was constructed in 1948 and a fluid bed roaster was added in 1950. In the mid-1950's, a two-stage fluid bed roaster was added along with a roaster gas cleaning plant. In the early 1980's, a new effluent treatment plant was added, and in 1992 to 1994, the mill's flotation cells were replaced. The Company's roaster currently operates in compliance with all existing legislation and regulations. The Giant Mine's plant and equipment are generally in good condition.
GEOLOGY
The Giant Mine is in the Yellowknife Greenstone belt, a package of Pre- Cambrian basic volcanic rocks. Orebodies are hosted in shear zones within the greenstones. Individual orebodies are veins, quartz lenses, or silicified areas within the shear. Gold is associated with fine-grained arsenopyrite.
The Nicholas Lake deposit is a series of narrow, steeply dipping quartz veins containing gold, arsenopyrite and other sulphides. These veins occur within a granitic intrusive body.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996, the Yellowknife operation, including Nicholas Lake, had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of approximately 2,078,000 tons grading 0.338 ounces of gold per ton. A cutoff grade of 0.20 ounces of gold per ton, based on current mining costs and a gold price of $527 (US$390) per ounce, was used in calculating these reserves. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling. In some areas, such as Nicholas Lake, higher cutoff grades were used.
REGULATIONS
Operations at both the Colomac and Giant mines are governed by Federal and Territorial statutes, ordinances and regulations. Included under Northwest Territorial jurisdiction are the Apprentices and Tradesmen Regulations, the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Regulations, Business License Fire Regulations, Explosive Use Regulations, Fire Prevention Act, Labour Standards Ordinance, the Northwest Territories Mining Safety Act, Workers Compensation Act, Public Health Ordinance, Emergency Measures Act and Environmental Protection Ordinance. Under Federal jurisdiction are the Clean Air Act, the Fisheries Act, Northwest Territories Waters Act, Territorial Lands Act, Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and the Canada Mining Regulations. Failure to comply may result in cease work orders and/or fines. Royal Oak believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any orders or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
ONTARIO DIVISION
TIMMINS OPERATIONS
Selected Operating Data - Ontario Division
BACKGROUND
The Pamour Mine consists of two underground (Pamour and Hoyle) and two open pit mining operations. The Pamour Mine is located approximately 15 miles east of the City of Timmins, Ontario, and has been in production since 1936. Both the Pamour and Hoyle properties are transected by Highway 101. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1936, the Pamour Mine has produced in excess of 4.0 million ounces of gold. The net book value of the Company's property, plant and equipment in the Ontario operations which includes 47,089 acres of exploration land, including those associated with the Pamour, Hoyle and Nighthawk properties, was approximately $89.9 million as of December 31, 1996.
OWNERSHIP
The Pamour property consists of 38 patented mining claims and one License of Occupation. Together, the property covers approximately 1,531 acres of mining and surface rights. Directly adjacent to the Pamour Mine is the Hoyle property which is comprised of 37 patented mining claims and 4 leased claims covering approximately 1,608 acres. The Company has a renewable 10-year lease on that portion of the Hoyle property lying south of the Timiskaming Unconformity where current mining operations are conducted. The lease terms include the payment of a minimum annual rent of $100,000 which is credited against a production royalty being the higher of $0.75 per ton or a 2% net smelter return. In order to renew the lease, which expires in 1999, for a further 10-year term, the Company must spend $1.0 million on exploration and mine one million tons of ore. Both conditions have been met so the lease will automatically be extended. The Company has earned a 51% interest in the portion of the Hoyle property north of the Timiskaming Unconformity, which is not currently in production.
MINING AND MILLING
The Pamour Mine currently operates both open pit and underground mining operations. The underground operations currently produce approximately 2,000 tons of ore per day, while the open pit operations produce approximately 1,500 tons per day. The Pamour Mine is comprised of the Pamour No. 1 Underground Mine, surface pits and the Hoyle Mine.
The Pamour No. 1 Underground Mine commenced operations in 1936 as the original Pamour Mine and has operated continuously since. The leased Hoyle Mine extension, which commenced production in April 1990, is the eastern strike extension of the Pamour orebody and is a large resource of bulk mineable conglomerate ore which has been accessed by a decline from surface and by underground drifts from the Pamour shaft. The underground mine currently produces approximately 2,000 tons per day through a 3,145 foot deep five- compartment timbered shaft. The Hoyle property has the capacity to produce 18,000 tons per month. The mine is adjacent to the Pamour No. 1 operation and has higher grade ore than present reserves at the Pamour No. 1 Mine.
Where possible, bulk mining methods are utilized, primarily by modified vertical crater retreat as well as sub-level blasthole stoping. The bulk mining areas are developed with large mechanized drill jumbos, scooptrams and trucks. Scooptrams and trucks move the blasted ore from the drawpoints to an internal pass. An electric trolley with 5 ton cars transports the ore from the internal pass to 3 Shaft where it is skipped to the surface. Higher grade, narrow veins are mined by a modified open shrinkage method. The ore is developed and mined with jacklegs and stopers which drill 1-1/4 inch blast holes. The broken ore is transported to the shaft by mechanized scoops, trucks and/or electric trains and then hoisted to the surface.
The No. 3 Pit is located immediately southeast of the Pamour Mill. This open pit was developed over the upper workings of the Pamour Mine and first came into production in 1985. The No. 5 Pit, at the extreme west end of the Pamour No. 1 property, was brought into production in 1989. Total pit production is 1,500 tons of ore per day.
An additional jaw crusher was added to the Pamour Mine in the early 1990's. In 1995, all 25-cycle electrical motors in the mine were replaced due to the change in the power supply from 25 cycles to 60 cycles. Also in 1995, an additional ball mill was installed to increase capacity from 3,600 to 4,000 tons per day. The on-site mill at Pamour has the capacity to treat approximately 4,000 tons per day. The Pamour Mine plant and equipment are generally in good condition. A gold pyrite flotation concentrate is produced from the ore and is treated by a conventional cyanidation process to produce a gold precipitate which is refined into dore. The power source for this property is Ontario Hydro.
PAMOUR MINE OPEN PIT EXPANSION
As a result of its successful exploration program from 1994 to 1996, the Company is developing a significant expansion project at the Pamour property. The Company has focused on developing ore reserves in a low grade halo around the mined out stopes at the Pamour Mine. The current dimensions of the ultimate pit are approximately 6,000 feet long, 2,400 feet wide and 1,000 feet deep.
GEOLOGY
The Pamour Mine is located approximately one mile north of the Destor- Porcupine Fault, an east-northeast to west-southwest striking structure. The majority of the historic gold producing mines in the Porcupine Gold Camp have been located near this structure. On the property, a series of basic volcanic rocks are unconformably overlain by greywackes and a thick conglomerate, known as the Pamour conglomerate. All rocks are of the Pre-Cambrian age. Gold occurs in narrow high grade quartz veins in the volcanics and in the sediments. The majority of the gold that has been mined from this property occurs in sheeted sets of quartz veins in the Pamour conglomerate and in the greywackes on either side of it. Gold also occurs in broad irregular zones of quartz veinlets in the volcanic rocks.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996, the Pamour and Nighthawk operations had proven and probable ore reserves of approximately 66,835,000 tons grading 0.042 ounces of gold per ton. The ore reserves at this division have increased in each of the last three years due to expansion of open pit reserves. Major drilling campaigns were undertaken in 1995 and 1996 for this purpose. Cutoff grades (which range from 0.023 to 0.200 ounces per ton) are determined for each type of ore based on current mining costs, and a gold price of $527 (US$390) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
NIGHTHAWK
BACKGROUND
The Nighthawk Mine, which was operated by Porcupine Peninsular Gold Mines Limited between 1924 and 1927, is located east of the Pamour Mine and reopened production in September 1995. Access is via highway, 10 miles from the Pamour Mill.
OWNERSHIP
The Company's land holdings in the Nighthawk Lake area are extensive with approximately 11,726 acres held representing 254 claims. Most of the property is held outright by the Company as staked claims. Other portions are held through various option agreements which also provide for some form of production royalty. The Ronnoco claims on the east peninsula of the lake are held through a subsidiary company, Ronnoco Gold Mines Limited. The current producing deposit, the Nighthawk Mine, is located on the north peninsula of the lake and is subject to a production royalty being the higher of (i) $0.003 times tons mined times dollars per ounce of gold or (ii) 20% of the net profits.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
During the period from 1924 to 1927, the Nighthawk Mine produced 99,628 tons of ore grading 0.32 ounces of gold per ton. Additional exploration was done periodically over the ensuing years. The Company developed the Nighthawk Mine and began production in September 1995. Full production levels of 750 tons per day were reached in May 1996.
The orebody is accessed by a ramp which will ultimately be driven to 750 feet below surface. Mining methods for this underground mine are primarily longhole open stoping, with 50 feet between sublevels. Waste rock will be placed in stopes as delayed backfill. Ore is hauled to surface stockpiles in 30 ton dump trucks. The material is then hauled by truck 10 miles to the Pamour Mill for processing. The mine's equipment is generally in excellent condition. The power source for this property is Ontario Hydro.
GEOLOGY
The Nighthawk Mine is adjacent to a major structure called the Nighthawk Break, which is thought to be a splay off of the Destor-Porcupine Fault. The geology in this area consists mainly of steeply dipping volcanic flows. In the mine area, these have undergone intensive carbonate alteration. Gold occurs in quartz veins and silicified zones associated with minor amounts of sulphide minerals.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996, the Nighthawk Mine had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of 648,000 tons grading 0.142 ounces of gold per ton and mineralized material of 599,000 tons grading 0.154 ounces of gold per ton. A cutoff grade of 0.100 ounces per ton, based on current mining costs and a gold price of $527 (US$390) per ounce, was used in calculating these reserves. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
MATACHEWAN
BACKGROUND
The Matachewan project is located approximately 56 miles southeast of the city of Timmins, Ontario and is accessed directly by Provincial Highway 566. The main area of interest is the site of two former producing mines, located two miles west of the Town of Matachewan.
The Matachewan property was mined from 1933 to 1957 by Young Davidson Mines Limited and Matachewan Consolidated Mines Limited and produced an aggregate of 956,117 ounces of gold grading 0.10 ounces per ton from both underground and open pit developments. The Matachewan deposit was milled historically using flotation and cyanidation which achieved excellent recoveries. In 1997 the Company plans to shut down the Hope Brook operations, moving the plant to Matachewan. The Hope Brook mill will be upgraded to a 5,000 tpd facility by the addition of another ball mill. The source of power for this property will be Ontario Hydro.
To date, the Company has received permits necessary to dewater the existing mine shaft and to proceed with opening up the underground for access to the old workings. Detailed permitting of the 5,000 tpd project is currently under way and expected to be completed by spring of 1998.
The development plan calls for milling of the open pit ore to commence by late in the fourth quarter of 1998 while the underground mine is being developed. Production is targeted for 100,000 ounces of gold per year at an average cash cost of US$227 per ounce. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements". The existence of a 2,450 foot deep shaft and very large ore blocks will allow the underground mine to be economically developed.
OWNERSHIP
The Matachewan property is held under two lease agreements. The lease agreement with Matachewan Consolidated Mines Limited provides for advanced royalty payments of $15,000 per year or rent of $7,500 per year, depending on the current gold price. The Young Davidson lease agreement provides for advance royalty payments of approximately $40,000 per year. The property is subject to a minimum 3% net smelter return royalty.
GEOLOGY
The Matachewan deposit is hosted within a syenite body which has intruded along and near the highly deformed contact between Timiskaming Group sedimentary rocks and Larder Lake Group volcanic rocks. The main syenite body is approximately 2,460 feet long, 410 feet wide and dips steeply to the south.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996 the Matachewan property had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of 12,440,000 tons grading 0.066 ounces of gold per ton. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling. Cutoff grades used in estimating these mineable reserves are 0.027 ounces per ton for open pit reserves and 0.080 ounces per ton for underground reserves and are based on current mining costs and a gold price of $527 (US$390) per ounce.
DUPORT
BACKGROUND
The Duport property is located on Shoal Lake, 28 miles southwest of the town of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, in the Lake of the Woods District. The development ramp is located on an island and is accessible by barge.
OWNERSHIP
Intermittent exploration of the Duport deposit was carried out by various parties from 1930 to 1950, including underground exploration. In 1973, Consolidated Professor Mines Limited obtained an option on the Duport property and conducted an extensive sampling and drilling program from 1973 to 1974. Subsequently, this option was exercised and Consolidated Professor acquired a 100% interest in this property after amalgamating with Duport Mining Company Limited. The Company completed the acquisition of all of the shares of Consolidated Professor in May 1996 pursuant to a tender offer followed by a compulsory acquisition. There is a royalty payable to Union Carbide Canada Limited ("Union Carbide") equivalent to a 50% net profits interest until recovery of pre-production expenditures, up to a maximum of $2.0 million. Thereafter, Union Carbide will receive a 10% net profits interest until a maximum of $5.0 million in the aggregate has been paid. There is a buy out provision for this royalty.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
The Duport project is situated in the environmentally sensitive area of Shoal Lake, the source of Winnipeg, Manitoba's residential and commercial water supply. Environmental concerns were raised in 1989 by local cottagers and the City of Winnipeg, after Consolidated Professor announced its plans to advance the project to the permitting stage. The main concern was the perception of potential environmental hazards associated with the processing of the refractory gold ore and the disposal of cyanide treated tailings. For the past six years, Consolidated Professor conducted impact and sensitivity studies related to these concerns. As a result of Royal Oaks' purchase, all aspects of mining, ore transport, milling, tailings disposal and site reclamation are being reconsidered with the objective of satisfying all concerned parties. Among other features, the redesigned development plan will involve transporting the ore by truck to the mainland via a year-round ferry to a mill site located 5.2 miles in land, outside of the Shoal Lake watershed. The new design concept effectively addressed every concern brought forth during the consultation process. Consolidated Professor has since submitted a detailed environmental study of the project to the Ontario, Manitoba and Canadian governments for review.
The Company plans to continue the environmental permitting process initiated by Consolidated Professor. Development of the project is anticipated shortly after the permitting process is completed.
GEOLOGY
The northern end of the Lake of the Woods District is underlain by the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of an extensive Keewatin greenstone belt. In the general Shoal Lake area, two granodiorite intrusions, namely, the Canoe Lake Stock and the Snowshoe Bay Stock, intrude the greenstone belt assemblage and are separated by a five mile broad section of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. Within this volcanic pile is a wide deformation zone which hosts the gold mineralized zones of the Duport project which occur as en echelon lenses within highly sheared felsic tuffs.
ORE RESERVES
The Duport project has mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of approximately 1,008,000 tons grading 0.38 ounces of gold per ton. A cutoff grade of 0.15 ounces per ton, based on current mining costs and a gold price of $517 (US$390) per ounce, was used in calculating these reserves. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.

NEWFOUNDLAND DIVISION
HOPE BROOK MINE
Selected Operating Data - Newfoundland Division
BACKGROUND
The Hope Brook Mine is located approximately 5 miles inland from the southwest coast of Newfoundland, between the towns of Burgeo and Port aux Basques. The mine currently produces 3,000 tons of ore per day. As of December 31, 1996, the Hope Brook Mine had mineable ore reserves of 63,000 ounces of gold and mineralized material of 104,000 ounces of gold. Access to the mine is restricted to air or sea travel. A 4,000 foot airstrip provides transportation for the mine employees and the mine operates as a fly-in, fly- out camp. The principal mode of access for supplies is by a ship owned and operated by Royal Oak exclusively for the mine. The ship is based out of Rose Blanche, Newfoundland. The net book value of the Hope Brook Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $10.3 million as of December 31, 1996.
The Hope Brook Mine reserves are expected to be substantially depleted by mid- year 1997. Therefore, in November 1996, the Company announced its decision to close Hope Brook in the third quarter of 1997 and relocate the majority of the mill assets and mine equipment to the Matachewan Project in Ontario, Canada.
OWNERSHIP
Production from the Hope Brook Mine is subject to an operating royalty for five years ranging from $1.3 million to $3.3 million annually in favor of the prior owner when the annual average spot price of gold exceeds US$380 per ounce. In 1996, the Company paid $1.3 million in respect of such royalty. This operating royalty expired at the end of 1996. The Hope Brook Mine area consists of a 25 year mining lease, surface lease and extended exploration licenses which cover approximately 6,800 acres of mining rights and 490 acres of surface rights. The Company holds a 100% interest in the property subject to the above operating royalty. All mining activities are confined to the mining leases.
MINING AND MILLING
The Hope Brook Mill was first commissioned in September 1988. In 1992, Royal Oak successfully modified the mafic pebble crushing circuit and, coupled with other circuit modifications, significantly increased overall throughput. In 1996, Hope Brook produced an average of 2,768 tons per day. Ore is delivered to the surface and crushed to a nominal minus 6 inch using a primary gyratory crusher. The crushed ore is stockpiled and withdrawn as required to feed the mill grinding circuit. Grinding to 70% minus 200 mesh is accomplished in a conventional SAG circuit followed by a conventional ball mill grinding circuit operating in closed circuit with cyclones. Gold is extracted from the grinding circuit product in a conventional 60 hour cyanide leach circuit followed by 6 stages of CIP. Gold is recovered from activated carbon in a pressure stripping-electrowinning circuit. Gold is stripped from the electrowinning cell cathodes and melted in an induction furnace to yield dore bullion. The dore is subsequently shipped to a refinery for final refining.
In 1993, a sulphide flotation circuit was added to the mill flowsheet. The final tailings from the CIP circuit is treated through an effluent treatment plant utilizing the INCO SO2-Air process. The treated slurry is conditioned and then subjected to a conventional copper rougher-scavenger flotation process. The resulting concentrate is upgraded through several stages of cleaner flotation to yield a concentrate grading 20 to 22% copper. The concentrate also bears significant gold values increasing overall mill gold recovery by up to 4%. The concentrate is dewatered, dried and shipped to a custom smelter for processing of both the contained copper and gold values.
The Hope Brook effluent treatment circuit achieved wastewater quality that was in substantial compliance with the mine's certificate of approval in 1994, 1995 and 1996. However, while the effluent treatment circuit was in full compliance with the mine's certificate of approval, the discharge from the mine's tailings impoundment area did not consistently pass Environment Canada's LC50 fish toxicity test. In Canada, gold mining operations are exempt from Environment Canada's Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations, including the LC50 fish toxicity test. The Company is working cooperatively with the Newfoundland Department of Environment to minimize the impact of this discharge on the environment.
The main access to the underground mine is by ramp which has been driven to a vertical depth of 1000 feet below surface. The haulage component of the ramp- haulage system installed at Hope Brook uses 55 ton capacity electric Kiruna trucks and diesel trucks. The prior owner of the Hope Brook Mine conducted its underground mining using a blasthole stoping and fill method. In 1995, the Company changed the mining method to sublevel stoping, similar to that used at its Hoyle property. The Hope Brook plant and equipment are generally in good condition. The source of power for this property is Newfoundland Hydro.
GEOLOGY
Gold mineralization occurs in an alteration zone of pervasive silica, pyrite, and pyrophyllite which is approximately 4 kilometers long and 300 meters wide. The alteration zone exists within the Mid-Ordovician Georges Brook Formation which consists of a mixed volcanic-sedimentary sequence. The Hope Brook orebody is located in the zone of alteration. Ore covers a strike length of 500 meters and extends from surface to a depth of 400 meters dipping steeply at an angle of seventy-five degrees.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1996 the Hope Brook Mine had remaining mineable (proven and probable) ore reserves of approximately 708,000 tons grading 0.089 ounces of gold per ton. A cutoff grade of 0.079 ounces per ton was used in calculating stope reserves. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
REGULATIONS
The Newfoundland Division is governed by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Occupational Health and Safety Act, Department of Environment and Lands Act, The Mineral Act, Waste Material Act, the Regulation of Mines Act, and the Government of Canada's Fisheries Act and Environmental Protection Act, and all regulations passed thereunder. Failure to comply therewith can result in cease work orders and/or fines. Royal Oak believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any order or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
UNITED STATES DIVISION
COPPERSTONE MINE
BACKGROUND
In June 1995, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the Copperstone property. The Copperstone property is located 20 miles north of Quartzsite and 60 miles south of Lake Havasu City in La Paz County, Arizona.
OWNERSHIP
The Copperstone property is held by the Company, under a renewable 10 year lease agreement and consists of 284 unpatented mining claims totalling 5,680 acres and 2 state leases covering 1,300 acres located in La Paz County, Arizona.
The Company is obligated to pay an advance minimum royalty annually of US$30,000 against a minimum 1% gross production royalty, and must spend US$1 million by the year 2000. As of December 31, 1996 the Company had spent approximately $500,000.
MINING AND MILLING
Cyprus Gold Corp. operated the Copperstone property between 1987 and 1992 and produced in excess of 500,000 ounces of gold from ore grading 0.10 ounces of gold per ton in the Main Zone by open pit mining and heap leaching. Compiled data indicates a down dip extension of the Main Zone as well as parallel structures in the footwall areas that could possibly be economically mined by underground methods. The Main Zone has been traced an additional 1600 feet along the dip of the structure below the floor of the pit as well as 600 feet along strike to the north. Gold mineralization remains open at depth and along strike. Previous drilling encountered high gold values over significant widths: 0.225 ounces of gold per ton over a core length of 50 feet (0.225 opt/50 ft), and 0.602 opt/10 ft approximately 2,000 feet to the north of the previous hole. Other intersections below the Main Zone recorded 0.646 opt/15 ft at a vertical depth of 900 feet and collared at the pit floor. A second phase of drilling in 1997 returned 1.55 opt/25 ft from a relatively untested limestone unit near the periphery of the known mineralization. A second hole positioned to investigate an untested area adjacent to two mineralized shoots returned 0.396 opt/35 ft.
GEOLOGY
The Copperstone deposit is hosted in variably altered, oxidized porphyritic plutonic rocks with mineralization focused by moderately dipping second- and third-order extensional structures related to a regional scale listric (detachment) fault.
ORE RESERVES
Currently there are no mineable reserves at the Copperstone property. However, a 500,000 (417,000 at December 31, 1996) ounce gold resource has been located through two phases of drilling program. A US$250,000 follow-up exploration program is planned for 1997. The objective of the program will be to further delineate the underground potential of the Copperstone deposit.
