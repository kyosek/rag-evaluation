lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Trust may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Trust's Board of Trustees may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of shareholders to the extent such policies are not governed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust.
Although the Trust has typically invested in developed real estate, the Trust may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees). To the extent that the Trust invests in construction and development projects, the Trust would be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.

Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Trust's assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income- producing real estate. The Trust expects that the percentage of its assets invested in mortgage loans will decrease, as it has determined that it will no longer actively seek to fund or acquire mortgage loans. It may, however, in special circumstances, originate mortgage loans or provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. The Trust intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in its portfolio. The Trust's mortgage notes receivable consist of first mortgage loans and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. The Trust has originated its own mortgage loans as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. The Trust is generally not considering new mortgage lending, except in special circumstances or in connection with purchase money financing offered to facilitate the sale of Trust properties. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Trust's mortgage notes. The Trust's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS - Business Plan and Investment Policy".

In addition to restricting the types of collateral and priority of mortgage loans in which the Trust may invest, the Declaration of Trust imposes certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
At December 31, 1996, the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio included seven mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $5.8 million secured by income-producing real estate located throughout the United States, seven mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $639,000 secured by single-family residences also located throughout the United States, one loan with an outstanding balance of $1.4 million secured by a ranch in Henderson County, Texas and one loan with an outstanding balance of $500,000 secured by a contract to purchase land in Dallas, Texas.

The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note receivable balance), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Trust's outstanding mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1996. The table does not include the $639,000 in mortgage notes secured by single-family residences discussed in the preceding paragraph, the $500,000 secured by a contract to purchase land or the $1.4 million mortgage note secured by a ranch. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1996 is as follows:
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
First Mortgage Loans. The Trust invests in first mortgage notes, with either short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the Trust's policy is to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Trust may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Trust.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1996.
At December 31, 1996, two of the Trust's first mortgage notes receivable with principal balances totaling $2.1 million were in default. One of the notes, with a principal balance of $1.4 million, matured in November 1995. The borrower is currently negotiating with the Trust for an extension of the note in return for a principal paydown and payment of all accrued interest, which totaled $276,000 at December 31, 1996. In February 1997, the Trust received a payment of $470,000 from the borrower, $305,000 being applied against accrued interest and $165,000 being applied to reduce the principal balance of the note. The Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss on this note as the estimated value of the property securing the note is in excess of the carrying value of the note. The other note, with a principal balance of $700,000, matured in July 1993. The Trust continues to receive partial interest payments monthly on the note. The Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss on this note in excess of previously established reserves.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Trust invests in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage loan having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan(s) plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Trust's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make first mortgage loans. At December 31, 1996, the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio contained no wraparound mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes the wraparound mortgage loan funded by the Trust in 1996.
In February 1996, the Trust sold the Rivertree Apartments in Hurst, Texas. In conjunction with the sale, the Trust provided $750,000 in

purchase money financing in the form of a wraparound mortgage note. The wraparound mortgage note bore interest at 9% per annum, required monthly payments of interest only and matured in November 1996. The loan was paid in full in August 1996. See "Real Estate," above.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Trust invests in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Trust's Declaration of Trust restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Trust's assets. At December 31, 1996, less than 1% of the Trust's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loan funded by the Trust in 1996.
In February 1996, the Trust funded a $1.5 million second lien mortgage secured by the Signature Athletic Club Building in Dallas, Texas. The note bears interest at 12% per annum and requires monthly interest only payments to the extent of available cash flow. Any accrued but unpaid interest is added to the principal balance of the note annually. In addition, the note requires quarterly principal payments equal to the property's excess cash flow for the quarter. The note matures in October 1998 with an option to extend the note to December 2000. The Trust has also guaranteed the underlying $3.0 million first lien mortgage secured by the property, which is current. The Trust has an option to purchase a 50% interest in the partnership which owns the Signature Athletic Club Building for $100 at any time. The option expires in December 2005. The property has had no available cash flow, therefore, the Trust ceased recognizing interest income effective June 1996.
Other. In July 1996, the Trust agreed to fund up to $500,000 on promissory note secured by a contract to purchase land in Frisco, Texas. Through December 31, 1996, the Trust has funded $500,000. The note bears interest at 13% per annum and all accrued interest and principal was due at the December 31, 1996 maturity date. The note's maturity was extended to March 30, 1997 upon payment of all accrued interest.
Equity Investments in Real Estate Entities
In September 1990, the Trust's Board of Trustees authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 million of the common stock of ART through negotiated or open market transactions. The officers of the Trust also serve as officers of ART and BCM. BCM, the Trust's advisor, also serves as advisor to ART. At March 7, 1997, ART owned approximately 40.6% of the Trust's outstanding shares of beneficial interest. At December 31, 1996, the Trust owned 818,088 shares of ART's common stock, approximately 6.1% of ART's common shares outstanding, which the Trust had purchased in open market transactions in 1990 and 1991, at a total

cost to the Trust of $1.6 million. The ART common stock owned by the Trust is considered to be available for sale and accordingly, is carried at fair value defined as the period end closing market value. At December 31, 1996, the market value of the ART common stock was $5.3 million. See ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."
In December 1990, the Trust's Board of Trustees authorized the purchase of up to $1.0 million of the shares of beneficial interest of NIRT, a REIT that until March 31, 1994, was also advised by BCM, and up to $1.0 million of the shares of common stock of TCI through negotiated or open market transactions. The Trustees of the Trust serve as directors of TCI and the officers of the Trust also serve as officers of TCI. BCM, the Trust's advisor, also serves as advisor to TCI. In December 1996, the Trust sold its NIRT shares to NIRT for $1.1 million in cash. The Trust received net cash of $550,000 after the payoff of margin debt secured by the NIRT shares. The Trust recognized a gain of $725,000 on the sale. At December 31, 1996, the Trust owned 79,500 shares of common stock of TCI acquired at a total cost to the Trust of $235,000 all of which shares the Trust had purchased in open market transactions in 1990 and 1991. The Trust's investment in TCI is considered to be available for sale and is carried at fair value. At December 31, 1996, the market value of the Trust's investment in TCI's common shares was $875,000.
Under the original terms of its Declaration of Trust, the Trust was prohibited from investing in equity securities for a period in excess of 18 months. However, pursuant to an amendment to the Trust's Declaration of Trust approved by the Trust's shareholders in May 1996, the Trust may hold any investments in equity securities, including the shares of ART and TCI, without any limitation on the holding period.
