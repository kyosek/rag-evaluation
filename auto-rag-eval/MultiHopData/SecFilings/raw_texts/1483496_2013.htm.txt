Item 2. Properties
Our Properties
Currently, our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Permian Basin, the onshore Gulf Coast of Texas, Southwest New Mexico and Kansas. The Permian Basin covers an area approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific onshore oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States. It is characterized by an extensive production history, mature infrastructure, long reserve life and hydrocarbon potential in multiple producing formations. Our primary operations in the onshore Gulf Coast are in conventional fields that produce primarily from the Wilcox formation in Zapata and Duval Counties of Texas.
The following map shows the location of our core properties as of May 31, 2013.
Summary of Geographic Areas of Operations
The following table sets forth summary estimated reserve information attributable to our principal geographic areas of operations as of May 31, 2013. The following table includes reserves represented by the 17% of Cross Border not owned by us.
Permian Basin
The following description of our properties in the Permian Basin is presented as of May 31, 2013.
Madera Prospect. The Madera Prospect consists of 2,545 gross (1,132 net) acres in Lea County, New Mexico. Our interests in the Madera Prospect include 7 gross (3.5 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 49.7% and an average net revenue interest of 38.8%. This acreage includes acreage acquired through an agreement with Chevron in January 2013 to sell ownership in our then existing acreage and associated wells in exchange for ownership in Chevron’s adjoining acreage and associated wells in order to more efficiently develop the prospect. RMR Operating is the operator of the Madera Prospect.
We drilled and completed our first horizontal well, the Madera 24 Federal 2H, on the Madera Prospect in January 2012. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of 9,028 feet and a lateral length of 4,620 feet in the Brushy Canyon reservoir and initially produced at a rate of 1,043 Boe/d, comprised of 86% oil. As of May 31, 2013, the Madera 24 Federal 2H well has produced over 111 MBoe, of which 77% was oil. A portion of the other working interest owners elected not to participate in the drilling and completion of the Madera 24 Federal 2H well. As a result, we increased our ownership to an 80.1% working interest (60.1% net revenue interest). Our ownership will revert to a 23.3% working interest (17.5% net revenue interest) when we recover an amount equal to 300% of the costs to drill and complete the well plus operating costs through that date.
We commenced drilling our second horizontal well in the Madera Prospect, the Madera 24 Federal 3H, on February 6, 2013. This well is located just to the west of the Madera 24 Federal 2H well. We are the operator of the well and own a 33% working interest and 25% net revenue interest. At May 31, 2013, we had finished drilling and completing the well. The initial production rate from the Madera 24 Federal 3H well was 1,491 Boe/d, of which 81% was oil. The well has a total measured depth of 13,570 feet, including a true vertical depth of 9,062 feet and a lateral length of 4,508 feet. At May 31, 2013, the well was still producing and permanent production facilities were under construction. The Madera Prospect contains an additional 4 proved undeveloped locations (1.7 net) that target the Brushy Canyon reservoir.
As of May 31, 2013, the Madera Prospect had estimated proved reserves of 1,015 MBoe, of which 690 MBoe were proved undeveloped, and had net daily average production for the month of May 2013 of 76 Boe/d, of which 66% was oil. Production from the Madera 24 Federal 2H well was shut in during May 2013 for the completion of the Madera 24 Federal 3H well.
Pawnee Prospect. We own oil and natural gas interests in 1,575 gross (1,445 net) acres in the Pawnee Prospect in Lea County, New Mexico. The six gross and net producing wells have an average working interest of 100% and an average net revenue interest of 75%. This acreage targets the Tansill, Yates and Delaware formations. RMR Operating is the operator of the Pawnee Prospect. We have a total of six gross and net productive wells on the Pawnee Prospect, four of which we acquired in December 2011 in exchange for the assumption of the plugging liability. We drilled two wells on the Pawnee Prospect during fiscal 2012. We completed the Big Brave State #1 well in January 2012 and the Good Chief State #1 well in December 2011, with initial production rates of 52 Boe/d and 28 Boe/d, respectively, consisting of substantially all oil production. Both wells are marginal producers, and we plan to evaluate the wells for potential conversion to salt water disposal wells. As of May 31, 2013, the Pawnee Prospect had estimated proved reserves of 3 MBoe and had net daily average production sold for the month of May 2013 of 8 Boe/d, all of which was oil production.
Cowden Lease. We own oil and natural gas interests in 760 gross (740 net) acres plus 48 acres of surface property in the Cowden Lease in Ector County, Texas. There are 19 gross (18.0 net) producing wells on the Cowden Lease with an average working interest of 94.7% and an average net revenue interest of 72.7%. The Cowden Lease is held by production. RMR Operating is the operator of the Cowden Lease. The Cowden Lease is located between the Harper and Donnelly San Andres fields on the Central Basin Platform and produces from the Grayburg and San Andres formations. It has three proved undeveloped drilling locations (three net wells). As of May 31, 2013, the Cowden Lease had estimated proved reserves of 100 MBoe, of which 76 MBoe were proved undeveloped, and had net daily average production sold for the month of May 2013 of 9 Boe/d, all of which was oil production.
Shafter Lake Lease. We own oil and natural gas interests in 322 gross (187 net) acres within the Shafter Lake San Andres field in Andrews County, Texas. The Shafter Lake Lease is horizontally severed at 4,520 feet and is held by production. We own all rights from the surface of the land to approximately 4,520 feet below the surface of the land. RMR Operating is the operator of the Shafter Lake Lease. There are three proved undeveloped locations on these leases (1.7 net wells) which target the Grayburg and San Andres formations. We hold a 58.1% working interest and a 39.7% net revenue interest in this acreage. As of May 31, 2013, our Shafter Lake Lease had estimated proved reserves of 66 MBoe, all of which were proved undeveloped, and no production.
Martin Lease. We own oil and natural gas interests in 351 gross (209 net) acres in Andrews County, Texas. The Martin Lease is horizontally severed at 5,000 feet and is held by production. We own the deep rights from 5,000 feet below the surface of the land. The target horizons on the Martin Lease are the Clearfork, Grayburg and San Andres formations. We own a 100% working interest and a 75% net revenue interest. As of May 31, 2013, our Martin Lease had no proved reserves or production. In the event we elect to perform operations on this property, RMR Operating will be the operator.

Tom Tom Area. Cross Border owns oil and natural gas interests in approximately 8,300 gross (6,200 net) acres in the Tom Tom and Tomahawk fields in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico. Cross Border is the operator of these leases. The target formation in the area is the San Andres reservoir, which is productive across the trend with the Cato field to the west and the Chaveroo field to the east. There are 66 gross wells (52.3 net) in the acreage, with an average working interest of 78% and an average net revenue interest of 65%. As of May 31, 2013, the Tom Tom area had estimated proved reserves of 518 MBoe, of which 93 MBoe were proved developed non-producing and 357 MBoe were proved undeveloped. The area had net daily average production sold for the month of May 2013 of 14 Boe/d, all of which was oil production.
On February 11, 2013, the BLM accepted a remediation plan submitted by Cross Border for its Tom Tom and Tomahawk fields. Pursuant to the remediation plan, Cross Border expects to spend $2.1 million during fiscal 2014 and 2015 to correct environmental issues on these fields.
We commenced a 10-well workover program in May 2013 to re-enter existing wells, clean out the wellbores, open unperforated pay, and increase pump efficiency. We have identified 12 wells (7.2 net) with proved developed non-producing reserves. Additionally, there are 14 proved undeveloped locations (10.6 net) that target the San Andres formation.
Non-Operated. Cross Border owns non-operated, oil and natural gas interests in 321,253 gross (19,473 net) acres in Chaves, DeBaca, Eddy, Lea and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico of the Permian Basin. Current development of this acreage is focused on prospective Bone Spring acreage located in the heart of the 1st and 2nd Bone Spring play, which encompasses approximately 4,390 square miles across both New Mexico and Texas. Other non-operated development targets include the Queen, Grayburg, San Andres, Yeso, and Abo reservoirs. Our operating partners, which include Apache Corporation, Mewbourne Oil Company, COG Operating LLC, Alamo Permian Resources, LLC, LRE Operating, LLC, Oxy USA Inc. and Devon Energy Production Company, LP, have significant footprints within these plays and are seeking to add to those footprints through lease and corporate acquisitions.

RMR Operating is the operator. As of May 31, 2013, the Kansas acreage had no proved reserves or production.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we generally conduct a preliminary title examination prior to the acquisition of properties or leasehold interests. Prior to commencement of operations on such acreage, a thorough title examination will usually be conducted and any significant defects will be remedied before proceeding with operations. We believe the title to our properties is good, defensible and customary with practices in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions that we believe do not materially detract from the use of such properties. With respect to our properties of which we are not the record owner, we rely instead on contracts with the owner or operator of the property or assignment of leases, pursuant to which, among other things, we generally have the right to have our interest placed on record.
Our properties are generally subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with our use of these properties. Substantially all of the properties of the Company, Black Rock, RMR Operating and Cross Border are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement with Independent Bank.
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of May 31, 2013.
(1)
Prices used are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period June 2012 through May 2013. For oil volumes, the average NYMEX spot price is $90.87 per Bbl. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price is $3.31 per MMBtu. The oil price of $82.89 per barrel is adjusted for quality, transportation fees and a regional price differential and the natural gas price of $5.08 per MMBtu is adjusted for high Btu energy content, transportation fees and a regional price differential. The adjusted oil and natural gas prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties.
(2)
Proved reserves include 100% of the reserve quantities attributable to Cross Border.
The following table sets forth our estimated PV-10 and standardized measure of discounted net cash flows as of May 31, 2013.
(1)
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. The closest GAAP measure to PV-10 is the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows. The standardized measure differs from PV-10 because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our standardized measure:
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process.”
At May 31, 2013, our estimated proved reserves were 3.5 MMBoe, consisting of 65% oil, which is an increase of 70% compared to our proved reserves of 2.1 MMBoe at May 31, 2012. During fiscal 2013, we added estimated proved reserves of 2.5 MMBoe through our acquisitions, including the acquisition of Cross Border, which were partially offset by production of 0.2 MMBoe and downward revisions in previous estimates of 0.8 MMBoe. The downward revisions were primarily comprised of 0.2 MMBoe due to a revision to the proved undeveloped reserves at Cowden and 0.5 MMBoe due to a revision to the proved developed behind the pipe reserves at Frost Bank and Peal Ranch.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At May 31, 2013, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 1.6 MMBoe, consisting of 79% oil, as compared to 1.2 MMBoe at May 31, 2012, consisting of 70% oil. During fiscal 2013, we added estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 1.0 MMBoe through the acquisition of Cross Border. We converted 0.3 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves, due to the completion of a well on the Madera Prospect, a well on the Villarreal Prospect and several wells on the Cross Border non-operated acreage. As of May 31, 2013, estimated future development costs relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves was $35.4 million. All of our currently identified proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be drilled by December 31, 2016.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our reserve reports were prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), independent petroleum engineers. CG&A estimated 100% of our proved reserves in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE Standards”) and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC.
The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards.
The principal person at CG&A who prepared the reserve report is Mr. Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at CG&A since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055) and has over 23 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 20 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. He is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserve definitions and guidelines.
We have an internal staff of geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team consults regularly with representatives of CG&A. We review with them our properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in their preparation of our fiscal year-end reserves estimates. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process, a copy of the reserve report is reviewed with representatives of CG&A and our internal technical staff before we disseminate any of the information. Additionally, our senior management reviews and approves the reserve report and any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves on an annual basis.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. The process also requires assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot be certain that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 18 - Supplemental Information Relating to Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)” to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, CG&A employs technologies consistent with the standards established by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data.

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table presents our total gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage by region as of May 31, 2013:
(1) “Gross” means the total number of acres in which we have a working interest.
(2) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests that we own in gross acres.
The primary terms of our oil and natural gas leases expire at various dates. Much of our developed acreage is held by production, which means that these leases are active as long as we produce oil or natural gas from the acreage or comply with certain lease terms. Upon ceasing production, these leases will expire. The following table summarizes by year our gross and net undeveloped leasehold acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years.
(1) “Gross” means the total number of acres in which we have a working interest.
(2) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests that we own in gross acres.
Productive Wells
The following table presents the total gross and net productive wells by area and by oil or natural gas completion as of May 31, 2013. Cross Border owns royalty interests in 17 gross wells (average of 0.42% net), which have been excluded from these well counts.
(1) “Gross” means the total number of wells in which we have a working interest.
(2) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests that we own in gross wells.
Drilling Activity
At May 31, 2013, we had one gross well (0.03 net) being drilled in the Red Lake area of New Mexico, and we had two gross wells (0.06 net) awaiting completion in the Red Lake area.
The following table summarizes the number of net productive and dry development wells and net productive and dry exploratory wells we drilled during the periods indicated and refers to the number of wells completed during the period, regardless of when drilling was initiated.
