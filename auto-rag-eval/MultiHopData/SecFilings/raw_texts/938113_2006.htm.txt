Montana Tunnels Mine
The mine was originally owned, constructed and operated in 1987 by Pegasus Gold, a mining company incorporated in Canada. In 1998, Pegasus filed for bankruptcy and in 2002, Apollo purchased Montana Tunnels Mining, Inc., the owner and operator of the Montana Tunnels mine.

On July 28, 2006, Apollo entered into a joint venture (“JV Agreement”) with Elkhorn Tunnels LLC (“Elkhorn”), in respect of the Mine. The JV Agreement called for Elkhorn to contribute $13 million in return for a 50% interest in the Mine.
As of December 31, 2006, Elkhorn had contributed $9.27 million and Apollo and Elkhorn agreed to amend the JV Agreement effective December 31, 2006 such that Elkhorn committed to complete the full funding of $13 million by executing a promissory note for $3.73 million to evidence its obligation to complete its contribution. On January 4, 2007 Elkhorn paid $1.73 million of the promissory note with the balance of $2.0 million being paid on February 23, 2007.
Location
The Mine is an open pit, poly-metallic mine and mill located about five miles west of Jefferson City, Montana. The Mine is located in the historic “Wickes-Corbin” mining district in Section 8 of Township 7 North, Range 4 West, Jefferson County. The Mine’s elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,300 feet with moderately mountainous topography. The Mine is easily accessible by way of interstate highway and paved roads. The mine and mill receive power supply from Northwestern Energy from overland power lines.
Production
At the Montana Tunnels mine the open pit mining activity was suspended on October 21, 2005 for safety reasons due to increased wall activity on the eastern side of the open pit. Following the suspension of mining, the mill continued to process ore from stockpiled material and produce gold doré and lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates until May 12, 2006 when all operations ceased and the property was placed on care and maintenance. For the year ended December 31, 2006, a total of 4,959 ounces of gold, 116,004 ounces of silver, 1,196,317 lbs of lead and 3,040,058 lbs of zinc were produced.
Following the signing of the JV Agreement the Mine commenced an open pit wall remediation program on August 10, 2006, which called for removal of approximately 7 million tons of waste over a six month period and encompassed the laying back of the east and south east sectors of the pit wall and rebuilding the access ramp. In August 2006 key maintenance personnel were hired to repair the mobile equipment fleet followed by the hiring of mine operating personnel during September 2006. On September 10, 2006, the first bench was blasted and waste rock removal began along with the construction of a new ramp access to the open-pit ore reserves which are at the pit bottom. As at December 31, 2006, we had excavated approximately 5.8 million tons of remediation waste and were working on the ramp system below switchback # 4 which is 100 feet above accessing the open pit bottom and the ore body. Upon reaching the open pit bottom in January 2007, waste material removal commenced to expose the ore body. Mill personnel were hired in late 2006 and early 2007 to begin maintenance work in preparation for the mill start up which occurred on March 1, 2007.
Montana Tunnels Mine Production History
(1) Cost per ton and costs per ounce are through May 2006. The Montana Tunnels mine ceased milling operations on May 12, 2006; therefore, no metal products were produced after that date.
The mine produced the following aggregate amounts of the listed metals from its inception in 1987 through December 31, 2006:
Description of Land, Geology, Process and Equipment
About half of Section 8 lands are our owned fee lands. Mining claims that cover the pit are listed in the table below.
Claims Covering Montana Tunnels Mine
Montana Tunnels owns or leases an aggregate of 5,088 acres in fee and patented lands. The property consists of 139 wholly or partially owned patented claims (2,413.42 acres), three patented leased claims (45.19 acres) which are held pursuant to a mining lease expiring on March 19, 2014, and 2,629.44 acres of owned fee lands. All patented claims and fee lands have been surveyed. In addition, 213 unpatented claims are maintained (4,260 acres). We estimate that 90% of the unpatented claims have been surveyed. A number of claims outside the contiguous mining claims and fee land are isolated.
None of the Montana Tunnels mine’s reserves are subject to royalties, but the mine does have three leased claims that contain mineralization, which will be subject to a 4.5% net smelter return royalty if they are mined. The annual holding costs of the Montana Tunnels properties, exclusive of property taxes, total $53,000.
The Montana Tunnels deposit is hosted in the central part of the diatreme, an upward-sloping passage forced through sedimentary rock by volcanic activity. The diatreme is a heterolithic breccia, characterized by a sand-size fragmented matrix of quartz latitic composition surrounding subangular to well-rounded fragments of Cretaceous Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics, Tertiary Lowland Creek Volcanics, and clasts derived from the Cretaceous Butte Quartz Monzonite pluton.
There are two main zones of mineralization at Montana Tunnels: (i) a central, pipe-like core of contiguous mineralization, and (ii) discontinuous zones of mineralization peripheral to the core deposit, termed fringe mineralization. The core of the deposit in plan view is oblong in shape and ranges from about 200 feet to 1000 feet in width, and from 1400 to 2000 feet in length, with a vertical extent of at least 2000 feet. The core zone strikes approximately N30 E and dips steeply (60 degrees to 80 degrees) to the northwest. Metallurgical projections are based on historical feed grade versus tails grade trends; mill throughput tonnage, ore properties relative to pit location and bench elevation; and ore blending requirements.
Open pit mining at Montana Tunnels is conducted 24 hours per day seven days per week. Mining is performed by two shovels, twelve 150 ton and two 85 ton haul trucks in addition to ancillary equipment. While fully operational, mine production averages approximately 40,000 tons per day of ore and waste.
When in full production a primary and secondary crusher is used, in series, to generate a coarse ore stockpile ahead of the concentrator. The crusher has an approximate capacity of 16,500 tons per day. The grinding circuit consists of a SAG mill, ball mill and tertiary crusher (SABC circuit) followed by conventional differential flotation. A gravity circuit, in closed loop with the ball mill, recovers 12-15% of gold produced by the concentrator. The remainder of the mill’s production is in the form of concentrates: a zinc-gold concentrate and a lead-gold-silver concentrate. The concentrates are shipped, via rail, to a smelter. The original plant was constructed during 1986 and 1987, and is currently in good working order.
At the same time Apollo entered into the JV Agreement, Apollo also entered into two other agreements with Elkhorn Goldfields Inc. (“EGI”), an affiliate of Elkhorn. The first agreement is an option agreement pursuant to which EGI was granted an option to purchase Apollo’s Diamond Hill mine for $0.8 million. The option has an exercise term of two years. The underground Diamond Hill gold mine is situated 28 miles southeast of Helena, Montana and has been on care and maintenance since 2000.
The second agreement is a custom milling agreement pursuant to which EGI will have the right to have MTMI process the ore from EGI’s Elkhorn mine, located 20 miles to the south of the Montana Tunnels mine, through the 1,000 ton per day Diamond Hill mill which is situated within the Montana Tunnels mill complex. The custom milling agreement also gives EGI a two-year option to purchase the Diamond Hill mill for $1.0 million.
Mineral Reserves
The table below shows the mineral reserves at Montana Tunnels.
Montana Tunnels Mine Reserve Statement at December 31, 2006(1)
(Apollo’s 50% interest)
(1) Recovery rates are expected to be 80% for gold, 71% for silver, 85% for lead, and 84% for zinc.
Environmental
The permitted plan of operations allows mining of ore reserves from the L-Pit mine design. Unstable pit walls in the ramp sector on the east side of the mine closed down the open pit in October 2005. A pit wall layback and pit ramp reconstruction in the east sector of the open pit was subsequently developed using extensive geotechnical analysis to ensure stability and safety for ongoing mining operations. A permit revision for the pit wall layback and associated changes was approved by the Department of Environmental Quality in December 2005. This work was initiated in August 2006 following completion of the JV Agreement with Elkhorn.
Although the open pit was closed in October 2005 milling of low grade stockpiles continued until May 2006 at which time the mill was shut down and the property placed on care and maintenance. As a result of the unplanned milling of the low grade stockpiles a revision to the operating permit was obtained in the fourth quarter of 2006 allowing the Mine to raise the tailings embankment thus increasing the tailings capacity to accommodate the mill tailings from the L-Pit ore reserves.
A major mine plan amendment continues to progress through an Environmental Impact Statement permitting process. If approved, the M-Pit mine expansion amendment by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and Bureau of Land Management would provide approximately 25 million tons of additional ore for processing and add approximately five years onto the life of the mine.
The bonding requirements for the Montana Tunnels mine are met by the following bond instruments:
(1) Apollo’s share of the amounts shown for 2006 is 50%.
National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, a unit of Continental Casualty Company (“CNA”), provides $14,988,000 of the total reclamation bonding for the Montana Tunnels mine plan of operations at a deferred bond premium cost of $14 per $1,000 of bonding under a Term Bonding Agreement dated August 1, 2002.
Bonding requirements are subject to adjustment by the State of Montana for various reasons from time to time. As noted above, the bonding requirement for the Montana Tunnels mine increased from $16,381,000 to $18,126,000 during 2006 as the result of a minor revision to the operating permit and a bond inflation adjustment.
Drilling
As of December 31, 2006, the Montana Tunnels mine database contains 896 reverse circulation, rotary, core and blasthole drill holes, totaling 470,299 feet that were drilled from the mid-1970s to the present by numerous mining and exploration companies.
From through 2004 thirteen reverse-circulation holes for 11,000 feet were drilled to increase confidence levels in the M-Pit reserve. The drill holes were placed as mine development phases provided locations to collar specific holes. Results from both the 2002 and 2004 drilling programs were favorable, providing a higher degree of definition to the current ore reserve and established the geometric distribution of the polymetallic grade mineralization in the M pit design.
The Montana Tunnels mine drill hole spacing is generally within the gold variogram range of 30 feet to 140 feet in the core.
Black Fox Project
Figure - Black Fox project location along Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone in Province of Ontario, Canada
Location
The Black Fox project is located approximately five miles east of the township of Matheson and 40 miles east of Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The property encompasses over 1,983 acres within the Hislop and Beatty Townships. Access and surface rights are owned solely by Apollo. The property is easily accessible by interstate highway and power is supplied by Hydro One.
The Black Fox property was formerly known as the Glimmer mine. In April 1996, Exall Resources Ltd. (“Exall”) purchased 60% of the property from Hemlo Gold Inc., and Glimmer Resource Inc. (“Glimmer”) held the remaining 40%.
In September 2002, we purchased all of the real estate and related assets of the Glimmer Mine from Exall and Glimmer. The mine, which ceased operations in May 2001, was renamed Black Fox. Apollo paid Exall and Glimmer an aggregate purchase price consisting of Cdn$3 million in cash and an aggregate of 2,080,000 of our common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, an additional Cdn$3 million was payable to Exall and Glimmer. This additional sum of Cdn$3 million was paid on January 6, 2006.
Black Fox sits astride the Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone (DPFZ), which is a deep break in the Precambrian rocks of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. This fault system hosts many of the deposits in the Timmins area. The system regionally strikes east-west and dips variably to the south. Black Fox lies on the southern limb of a large scale fold on a flexure in the DPFZ Fault where the strike changes from east-west to southeast. Folded and altered ultra mafic and mafic are the host rocks for mineralization. Gold occurs as free gold in quartz veining and stockworks in altered ultra mafics and in gold associated with pyrite in altered tholeiitic basalts.
From until 2001, the mine produced approximately 210,000 ounces of gold. In early 2003, we commenced a drilling program consisting of shallow holes to test the mine’s open pit potential. During 2003, 297 surface core holes were completed with depths varying from 200 to 500 meters.
Property, plant and equipment at the mine consists of an administration office, change house facilities, core sheds and surface infrastructure for the mine (pumps, heating, etc.), all of which are in good working condition.
None of the currently defined resources or reserves are subject to production royalties. However, Apollo owns properties totaling 1,266 acres that owned by Apollo are subject to net smelter return royalties, ranging from 2.0% to 3.25%, if in the future any reserves are found on that property.
Exploration and Development 2004
In February 2004, a new drilling program commenced which first required the existing ramp system to be extended down to the 235 meter level and the construction of a 913 meter drift so as to allow drilling of the ore body from underground. During 2004, 210 underground holes totaling 41,065 meters were drilled.
Also in 2004, an additional 105 surface holes were completed, totaling another 43,284 meters. Our objectives for drilling these surface holes were to better define the open pit reserves; extend our resources along strike; extend resources in the eastern and western extensions of the main structure, bracketing or undercutting known gold-bearing zones; and explore known geophysical targets.
In April 2004, through surface exploration drilling we discovered a new ore body in the footwall of the DPFZ. The discovery hole was based on the extension of an induced polarization anomaly. There are two components to the mineralization, the quartz breccia veins and the massive sulfide mineralization (Pb, Zn, Ag). These appear to be two mineralizing events sharing the same “plumbing system.”
Exploration and Development 2005
During 2005 the surface and underground drilling programs continued with a total of surface holes and 160 underground holes being completed.
Exploration and Development 2006
During 2006 a further 3 holes were added to the surface and underground drilling programs. As of December 31, 2006, Apollo had completed a total of 453 surface diamond drill holes, totaling 130,390 meters as well as 386 underground holes totaling 75,704 meters giving a to-date total for both of 206,094 meters.
Apollo’s drilling supplemented the data from the 285 surface and 721 underground drill holes drilled by the previous owners. A table of total drill holes is shown below.
Black Fox Project Drill Hole Database
In 2005, we began the permitting process for the project, which we anticipate will be finished in late 2007 or early 2008 based on a plan for a combined open pit and underground mine with a 1,500 tonnes per day on-site mill. The estimated cost of the mine and mill is approximately $80 million.
Mineral Reserves
The reserves reported in a Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 report in August 2006 of 448,800 ounces of gold and the resources were based upon the 2003 to 2006 exploration program and included a pre-feasibility study of developing an open pit mine on the Black Fox property. This study did not consider any underground material. We report no reserves at Black Fox under SEC Industry Guide 7, which requires a final bankable feasibility study.
The new resource study was prepared by MDA. MDA has confirmed that the resource study complies in all respects with NI 43-101 guidelines. The table below summarizes the Black Fox Total Mineral Resource:
Black Fox Total Mineral Resource Summary
MDA completed the resource estimate of material contained in the Black Fox model between the 9300 elevation and the 9960 elevation. Most of the resource is contained in a part of the Destor-Porcupine Fault, 750 meters along strike and drilled to a depth of 350 meters on the west and 500 meters on the east. The mineralization remains open along strike and to depth.
The Black Fox resource estimate is based on two cut offs. A 0.90 g Au/t cut off, suitable for the open pit, was applied to material down to the 9720 elevation, or about 280 meters below the surface. Below the 9720 elevation, a 3.0 g Au/t cut off was used since it is likely that this material would only be mined by underground methods.
Open Pit Reserves
The open pit reserves of 448,800 gold ounces are in a pre-feasibility study completed by MDA. The study indicates an economic project based on a gold price of $550 per ounce.
Pit optimization studies were completed utilizing the following parameters for the deposit:
·
Overburden mining costs - $1.25 per tonne of material;
·
Rock mining costs - $1.50 per tonne of material;
·
Processing costs - $12.16 per tonne ore;
·
General administration costs - $4.50 per tonne ore;
·
Plant gold recovery - 96%; and
·
Assume 50% of existing underground workings backfilled with material having a density of 2.0.
Open Pit Economics
The Black Fox project reserves were developed by completing a pre-feasibility study for the project considering open pit mining and two processing options:
·
Own Milling - Construction of a new mill on the project site (base case); and
·
Toll Milling - Toll milling at a nearby mill (toll mill case).
Open Pit Economics - Own Mill - Reserve Ounces Only (base case)
Using the open pit reserves only and assuming a gold price of $550 per ounce, an on site mill processing facility with a capacity of 1,500 tonnes per day and tailings facility has a positive NPV of $36.1 million at a 5% discount rate and an IRR of 21.63%.
Open Pit Economics - Toll Milling Case - Reserve Ounces Only
Using the open pit reserves only, at a gold price of $550 per ounce, an off site mill processing facility with a capacity of 1,500 tonnes per day and tailings facility has a positive NPV of $54.0 million at a 5% discount rate and an IRR of 96.27%.
Bonding
We met the bonding requirement of Cdn$644,650, established by the Province of Ontario, for the Black Fox project through a letter of credit issued by TD Canada Trust secured by a pledged deposit account of Cdn$644,650.
The obligations to reimburse TD Canada Trust for any drawing under the letter of credit are secured by Apollo’s maintenance of an amount equal to the amount available for drawing in a deposit account pledged to TD Canada Trust. The annual letter of credit fee is 1% of the amount available for drawing. Interest is earned on the deposit account at a rate established by TD Canada Trust from time to time.
Exploration Stage Properties
Huizopa
We own Mexican subsidiaries which own concessions at the Huizopa exploration project. Pursuant to an agreement with the previous owner of one of those Mexican subsidiaries (the “Previous Owner”), if we exercise our right to acquire those concessions at the Huizopa project on which we currently hold an option, one of our Mexican subsidiaries and a Mexican company owned by the Previous Owner will enter into a joint venture agreement governing activities at the Huizopa project going forward, pursuant to which we can elect to ultimately retain up to an 80% interest in the Huizopa project. If our Mexican subsidiary chooses not to go forward with the Huizopa project, it is obligated to transfer a controlling interest in the subsidiary that holds the option back to the Previous Owner, and to transfer 91% of the concessions it owns at the Huizopa project back to the Previous Owner.
The Huizopa project is located in the northern part of the Sierra Madres in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, near the border with the State of Sonora, and encompasses a block of mining concession claims of approximately 22 sq. km. Huizopa is located about 17 km southwest of the Dolores project and approximately 33 km to the northeast of the Mulatos project. Mulatos and Dolores are both multi-million ounce gold-silver deposits owned by other companies that are currently in development. Sporadic shallow underground mining limited to a few high-grade zones was done in the past but no mining has taken place at Huizopa since 1936. The property is very remote and will be accessed initially by helicopter. During 2004, we acquired new claims that completely surround the old Huizopa land position and, as a result, have expanded our land position to a total of 128 sq. km.
To maintain the exploration and exploitation rights for the “Rosa” and “Donna” concessions, we were required to pay $0.1 million in April 2007 and $1.5 million (plus applicable taxes in Mexico) in October 2007. These concessions represent approximately 17% of the Huizopa property. These payments were made ahead of schedule on February 28, 2007 when the Company issued 1,000,000 shares and paid $2.55 million in settlement of certain claims and the outstanding land payments on its Huizopa properties.
The geology is characterized by a series of parallel, low sulfidation gold-silver, quartz veins hosted by Tertiary-age volcanic rocks. Silver to gold ratios in the veins and from the material on historic mine dumps indicate the Huizopa area hosts an extensive gold-bearing hydrothermal system. Two major parallel quartz vein systems with north trending structures contain many single vein outcrops to 10 meters thick suggesting a series of stacked veins. Strike lengths are over 2.0 km on the property with untested down dip potential. The stratigraphy of the Huizopa area has two sections of relatively mafic lava flows with intercalated volcanic lastics. The dominant strike azimuths of faults are 340º and 160º with dips ranging from vertical to 33º. Most of these structures, including the major faults with associated thick gouge or breccia zones, dip eastward. These east dipping faults are the faults associated with quartz veins, brecciation, and mineralization.
Initial favorable geochemical sampling and field studies by the Previous Owner in December 2003 were confirmed by us when we reviewed the data and conducted a field evaluation in 2004.
Mapping of the mining concession began in June 2004 and have been ongoing through 2006. We also established an extensive remote field camp at the project and refurbished an existing airstrip. The camp is supplied by fixed wing aircraft and helicopter. The results were compiled and transferred to our new topography maps and air photos as well as the Mexican government’s Chabacan topographical sheet which has been enlarged from 1:50,000 scale to 1:10,000. Geologic mapping suggests that the faults that host gold-silver mineralization may be more numerous and more continuous than earlier field work indicated. Petrographical examination revealed the presence of native gold, silver, and electrum in many samples and widespread vein features indicative of repeated boiling and explosive brecciation. Overall vein textures are consistent with high-level exposures of epithermal quartz-adularia and/or fault breccia veins.
In 2006, a geophysical program was initiated on the property and the process to select initial drilling sites was commenced.
In the first quarter of 2006, Apollo entered into an agreement with the Ejido Huizopa (the “Ejido”). Pursuant to the agreement, and in consideration for certain payments to the Ejido, the Company has a right to use Ejido land covering the 12,800 hectares of the Company’s mining concessions in Huizopa for all activities necessary for the exploration, development, and production of potential ore deposits in our Huizopa project area. The Company may, in the future, apply for a change of use of land without any additional obligations to the Ejido. In addition, the Company may traverse adjoining and nearby Ejido land outside the boundaries of the Huizopa mining concessions for the purpose of constructing, operating, and maintaining improvements or facilities necessary for the Huizopa project.
The current 2007 plan contemplates the construction of a dirt road to allow easier access to the site, followed by an initial core drill and a reverse circulation drill campaign of approximately 50 holes.
Diamond Hill
The Diamond Hill mine, which has been on care and maintenance since 2000, is owned by Montana Tunnels Mining, Inc. The mine is an underground gold mine and is located approximately 28 miles southeast of Helena, Montana, in Broadwater County and on the east flank of the Elkhorn Mountains, within the Hassel Mining District. The Diamond Hill mine was in production from 1996 to 2000, during which time, 775,000 tons of ore were mined at an average grade of 0.233 ounces of gold per ton.
On July 28, 2006, Apollo entered into an agreement with Elkhorn Goldfields Inc. (“EGI”), an affiliate of Elkhorn. The agreement is an option agreement pursuant to which EGI was granted an option to purchase the Diamond Hill mine for $0.8 million. The option has an exercise term of two years.
The Diamond Hill mine covers over 2,590 acres of patented and unpatented claims. We have 100% ownership of the main patented claims that contain the current deposits, subject to a 0.5 to 1% net smelter return and a 10% net profits royalty. We also have 50% ownership of four additional patented claims, which are peripheral to the main land package. As of December 31, 2006, we hold 103 unpatented claims and lease 19 unpatented claims. The current mine permit covers 270 acres with most of the disturbance within a 27 acre area.
The Diamond Hill ore bodies and mine workings are in solid unfractured rock and accordingly are amenable to low cost sublevel open stoping methods. Ore was transported to the Montana Tunnels mill facility by truck where it was processed in a separate circuit designed for Diamond Hill ore. Most of the gold was recovered into a high grade pyrite concentrate and sold to Japanese smelters. The deposit is classed as a skarn hosted sulfide deposit where the predominant ore mineralogy is gold associated with pyrite and lesser other metal sulfides.
The bonding requirements for Diamond Hill, totaling approximately $623,000, are incorporated as part of the bonding at Montana Tunnels.
ITEM 3.
