RESERVES AND MINERAL DEPOSITS
The following table shows gold reserves net to the Company at December 31, 1996:
Mineable Proven and Probable Reserves (1)
Ore Gold Grade Contained Gold (Millions of tons) (oz/ton) (000 ozs) ------------------ ---------- -------------- Crown Jewel Project (2)(3) 3.915 0.182 712 - -------------- (1) The information was provided by Battle Mountain, the Company's joint venture partner. The Company's proven and probable reserves are reported as mineable (extractable) ore reserves. Reserves do not reflect recovery losses in the milling process, but do include allowance for dilution of ore in the mining process. Reserves have been calculated based on a gold price of $375 per ounce. Metallurgical recovery of 88% was estimated.
(2) While Crown has 100% ownership of the Crown Jewel Project, 54% is subject to Battle Mountain's right to acquire an interest in the property under the terms of the Crown Jewel Venture Agreement ("Venture Agreement") and, therefore, these ounces have not been included above.
(3) In addition to the Company's 46% interest in the Crown Jewel Proven and Probable Reserves, shown above, are mineral deposits of 277,000 tons at a grade of 0.182 ounces of gold per ton.
In addition to the above, Crown has identified mineral deposits on the Cord Ranch, Kings Canyon, Manhattan, South Penn and Bongara properties.
The following discussion summarizes the primary mining properties in which the Company has interests. Company management believes the properties described below are favorable for mineral development, although there is no assurance that any of the properties in which the Company has or may acquire an interest will be economically viable.
United States
The following map shows the location of the primary properties in which Crown has interests in the western United States.
CROWN JEWEL PROJECT
GENERAL. The Crown Jewel Project is a joint venture between the Company and Battle Mountain, located on an approximate 8,000 acre property 24 miles east of Oroville, Washington. The joint venture agreement provides for Battle Mountain to fully fund exploration and development costs through the commencement of commercial production to acquire its interest. No monies are repayable by Crown to Battle Mountain for the costs Battle Mountain incurs prior to commercial production. Battle Mountain is required to construct a facility to treat a minimum of 3,000 tons of ore per day.
Crown discovered the Crown Jewel gold deposit in 1988, and has expended approximately $3.4 million in land, acquisition and exploration costs. In March 1990, the Company signed an option letter agreement with Battle Mountain to form a joint venture. Upon grant of the option the Company received $5.0 million from Battle Mountain and an additional $5.0 million in January 1991 when the option was exercised. Shortly thereafter, the Company and Battle Mountain entered into a definitive joint venture agreement, which replaced the option letter agreement, giving Battle Mountain the right to earn 51% in the Crown Jewel deposit.
In May 1994, Crown and Battle Mountain reached an agreement resolving certain contractual issues related to the Crown Jewel Venture Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Battle Mountain paid to Crown $4,250,000 in cash plus 435,897 shares of Battle Mountain common stock (valued at $4,250,000) in exchange for (1) the right to earn an additional 3% (to 54%) in the first 1.6 million ounces of gold recovered from the Crown Jewel property and (2) release of Battle Mountain from its obligation to make any of the quarterly $1.0 million payments to Crown which might otherwise have become due because of startup delays on the project. Production after 1.6 million ounces of gold are recovered will be shared 51% by Battle Mountain and 49 percent by Crown. The Company does not anticipate receiving additional mineral property proceeds from Battle Mountain under the joint venture agreement.
GEOLOGY AND LAND. The Crown Jewel deposit occurs within a large skarn system formed at the southern contact of the Buckhorn Mountain Cretaceous-aged diorite-granodiorite pluton with Triassic-aged limestones and andesites. Both the skarn system and ore body are relatively tabular and flat-lying in geometry. The skarn system is compositionally zoned in relation to the intrusive pluton with gold mineralization both concordant and crosscutting to the various skarn assemblages.
The property is held by a combination of fee ownership, private mining leases with options to purchase, state mining leases, with the balance being unpatented mining claims. Royalties vary from 4%-5% net smelter return ("NSR") royalties on certain private parcels, however, the ore body as currently defined is not subject to royalties payable to any third party.
RESERVES. The following table summarizes the Crown Jewel reserves as of December 31, 1996, as provided by Battle Mountain:
Proven and Probable Reserves (100% basis) Contained - --------------------------------------------- Ounces Grade Contained Crown's Tons (oz/ton) Ounces 46% Share --------- -------- --------- --------- Crown Jewel 8,510,000 0.182 1,549,000 712,000
All reserves are considered to be open pit mineable. The proven/probable reserve was based on results from 765 drill holes totalling 307,038 feet. The trial pit design utilized a 0.042 ounce per ton ("opt") gold cut off grade, a waste to ore ratio of 10.7:1 and a metallurgical recovery factor of 88% for gold. The assumed economic parameters applied to the design included mining costs of $0.85 per ton of waste and ore. Processing costs were estimated at $10.91 per ton based on a 3,000 ton per day facility. A $375 gold price was used.
Based on the same cutoff grade and gold price, Battle Mountain has estimated that other mineral deposits of 602,000 tons at 0.182 opt gold (100% basis) also occur within the currently designed pit limits at Crown Jewel.
EXPLORATION. The Company began an exploration program at Crown Jewel in mid-1988 and by the end of 1989 had drilled approximately 200 holes on the property. Between March 1990 and December 1992, Battle Mountain drilled over 550 holes designed to both confirm and expand the known reserve. To date, only 500 acres of the approximate 2,000 acres of prospective skarn geology have been drill-tested.
FEASIBILITY STUDY. In March 1992, the results of an independent feasibility study commissioned by Battle Mountain were received by the Company. Based on these results, Battle Mountain announced its decision to proceed with development of the Crown Jewel gold deposit. The feasibility study confirmed Battle Mountain's previous reserve estimate. The feasibility study also estimated that approximately $40 million in capital would be required to fund the project through to commercial production. The study estimated direct cash production costs at $160 per ounce of gold produced. Based on current reserves, the study indicated an approximate eight-year mine life with production averaging 175,000 ounces (100% basis) of gold per year.
Further engineering and reserve studies by Battle Mountain since the feasibility study was completed have generally confirmed the overall operating cost estimates and mineable reserves of the original 1992 feasibility study. However, capital costs are now estimated at approximately $65 million to achieve commercial production. Battle Mountain will be responsible for funding these additional capital costs.
PERMITTING AND DEVELOPMENT. Battle Mountain submitted its original Plan of Operations to the Washington State DOE and the USFS in January 1992. Several supplemental plans that further clarified or refined the proposed operational plans have been subsequently filed. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement was released in June 1995.
In February 1997, the FEIS was filed by the USFS and the DOE. The FEIS describes the environmental effects of the plan to construct and operate the Crown Jewel mine, and alternatives to that plan. Also, in February 1997, the Record of Decision for the FEIS was filed by the USFS and the BLM. The Record of Decision documents the decision by the USFS and BLM to select the mining alternative as presented in the FEIS. The alternative chosen by the USFS and the BLM was the Proponent's (Battle Mountain) Alternative as described in the FEIS and as modified by the Record of Decision. The decision to allow development of the Crown Jewel mine is subject to appeal within the various jurisdictions for up to 45 days from the date of publication of the decision.
Several appeals contesting the FEIS were filed with the USFS in March 1997. The USFS has 45 days to either accept the appeals and revise the FEIS or deny the appeals and affirm the FEIS. Most substantive permit applications necessary to begin construction have been filed with the various local, state and federal agencies and are undergoing review. This review process is expected to be completed in July. Pending successful completion of the permit applications, and the absence of an injunction, construction of the Crown Jewel project could begin in the fall of 1997 and is forecast to take approximately 14 months. Potential delays due to the appeals process, permit process or litigation are difficult to quantify. See LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
FINANCING. In order to acquire its 54% interest in the project, Battle Mountain is currently funding all general property, exploration and development costs through the start of commercial production, including the construction of a mill facility capable of processing a minimum of 3,000 tons of ore per day. No monies are repayable by Crown to Battle Mountain for the costs incurred through the pre-commercial production stage. Upon the start of commercial production Crown will be required to fund its 46% share of production costs. In the event that Battle Mountain is unable to proceed with the project and must relinquish its right to acquire a 54% interest, the Company would then make a decision to either proceed with the project alone or seek a similar joint venture situation with another major mining company. There is no assurance that the Company could successfully pursue either strategy.
CORD RANCH PROJECT
GENERAL. In 1989, the Company entered into an exploration and mining agreement with the surface and mineral rights owners of the
34,000 acre Cord Ranch located in Elko County, Nevada. The lease agreement was originally for a term of five years from August 31, 1989 and renewable thereafter.
Following several amendments, the lease now requires a work commitment of $300,000 in 1997. In addition, the agreement calls for non-recoupable minimum annual payments of $150,000 in each of 1997 through 1999 and recoupable annual advance royalty payments of $200,000 in 2000 and thereafter. Pursuant to the amended agreement, the Company may terminate the lease agreement at any time and avoid any future obligation or commitment, except reclamation.
Two property acquisitions immediately adjacent to the Cord Ranch were made in 1990. The Dixie Creek project, consisting of 1,240 acres, was acquired under agreements entered into in October 1990. At approximately the same time, the Pinon Range property, consisting of 640 acres of unpatented claims, was acquired.
In September 1994, Crown signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Cyprus Amax Minerals Company ("Cyprus") giving Cyprus the right to earn a 70% interest in Crown's Cord Ranch and adjacent gold properties. In June 1996, Cyprus assigned its rights under the agreement to a subsidiary of Royal Standard Minerals Inc. ("Royal Standard"). In order to vest in any of the Crown properties, Royal Standard must fulfill the terms of the Cord lease agreement, as amended, including the work commitment and property payments as specified. In addition, should Royal Standard vest in the properties, it must provide Crown's share of expenditures through the completion of a favorable feasibility study, with such expenditures to be repaid from Crown's share of production from the properties.
GEOLOGY. The Cord Ranch properties lie on the east side of the Pinon Range and are situated on the Carlin gold trend, where nearly 4 million ounces of gold are produced annually. Paleozoic strata underlying the western parts of the property are the same formations hosting major deposits in other sections of the trend. The area has sustained multiple periods of deformation and structural preparation of the rocks is very good. Gold mineralization is generally associated with jasperoid rocks.
MINERAL DEPOSITS. To date, over 400 drill holes have been completed on the Cord Ranch project. In early 1994, the Company estimated the size of two gold deposits, the Pinon Range and Dark Star deposits. Based on the results of 150 drill holes, the Pinon Range mineral deposit is estimated at 7.2 million tons containing 0.025 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt of gold.
At Dark Star, 61 drill holes completed by the Company during 1991-92 define a mineral deposit totalling 7.5 million tons grading 0.020 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt of gold. Crown holds 50% of the mineral rights and 100% of the surface rights at Dark Star.
SNOWSTORM PROJECT
GENERAL. The 5,400 acre Snowstorm property lies at the northwestern extension of the Carlin trend and the northeastern extension of the Getchell trend in northern Nevada. The property consists of approximately 2,400 acres of 100%-owned unpatented mining claims and 3,000 acres of leased fee property. The leased property carries a NSR royalty ranging from 3% to 5% depending upon the price of gold. In February 1997, Crown signed a Letter of Intent allowing Romarco Minerals, Inc. ("Romarco") to earn a 60% interest in the project. Romarco must spend $2 million on exploration and make $275,000 in cash payments to Crown over a four-year period to earn its interest. The agreement is subject to a 45-day due diligence period.
GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION. The geology of the project area consists of Tertiary volcanic rocks that have undergone various degrees of hydrothermal alteration. In 1996, Crown carried out a significant soil sampling and geologic mapping program to define drill targets. Five drill holes totalling 4,400 feet were completed. No economic gold mineralization was discovered, however, strong alteration was observed in four of the drill holes.
OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS
KENDALL MINE ROYALTY. In September 1991, Crown acquired Judith Gold Corporation ("Judith"), whose primary asset is the Kendall property located near Lewiston, Montana. Crown issued approximately 306,000 shares of common stock in the transaction, representing 2.5% of Crown common stock then outstanding.
Canyon Resources Corporation ("Canyon") leases the Kendall property. Under an agreement entered into by Judith and Canyon in 1987, Crown is entitled to receive a 5% NSR royalty on production at the Kendall gold mine.
Mining of ore at the Kendall mine ceased at the end of 1994, with residual heap leach gold production continuing through 1996. The mine produced approximately 300,000 ounces of gold over its life, with Judith receiving the equivalent of approximately 15,000 ounces over that period. The Kendall mine is presently in reclamation.
LAMEFOOT MINE ROYALTY. In 1992, Crown acquired from various underlying lease holders a 0.75% NSR royalty interest in the Lamefoot deposit for an aggregate total of $306,000. This property lies approximately three miles from the Kettle River Project ("KRP") mill, operated by Echo Bay Mines Ltd. ("Echo Bay") in northeastern Washington state. Lamefoot ores represent the primary ore feed source to the KRP mill through 1999, according to Echo Bay. Crown received approximately $156,000 in royalties from Lamefoot during 1996. Crown expects to receive approximately $200,000 in royalties from Lamefoot during 1997.
KINGS CANYON. The Kings Canyon property in Utah consists of 9,870 acres of unpatented mining claims and state leases. Crown holds a 100% interest in the property, subject to a 1-4% NSR royalty to third parties.
The Company estimates the Kings Canyon property hosts a mineral deposit that contains 6.8 million tons of material grading 0.030 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt gold. The gold occurs as sediment-hosted disseminated mineralization in Paleozoic carbonate rocks.
In March 1995, Crown signed an Option Agreement with Sway Resources Ltd. ("Sway") on the property granting Sway the right to earn a 51% interest. Sway later changed its name to Orion International Minerals Corporation ("Orion"). To earn its interest, Orion must spend $3.0 million on exploration over a five year period and issue to Crown 200,000 shares of Orion common stock. Orion has thus far issued 100,000 of these shares to Crown.
MANHATTAN. A 100% interest in the 540-acre Manhattan property in central Nevada was acquired in 1989. In November 1994, the Company signed a purchase option agreement with New Concept Mining, Inc. ("New Concept"), that allows New Concept to purchase 100% of the property by making a series of payments, over a four and one-half year period, totalling $500,000. Of that amount, $440,000 remains to be paid.
SOUTH PENN. The South Penn property, a 50/50 joint venture with Sutton Resources Ltd., is located in northeastern Washington. The property consists of approximately 320 acres of leased patented and unpatented claims and fee land. Seventy drill holes define a mineral deposit of 278,000 tons grading 0.078 ounces of gold per ton using a cutoff grade of 0.040 opt of gold. In November 1995, Santa Fe Pacific Gold Company ("Santa Fe") optioned a 100% interest in the property from the joint venture for a total consideration of $250,000 payable over a three-year period, including $20,000 paid on signing of the agreement. In August 1996, Santa Fe terminated its option and has no further rights in the property.

BONGARA ZINC PROJECT, AMAZONAS DEPARTMENT, PERU
GENERAL. Pursuant to option agreements dated November 3, 1993 (the "Bongara option") between the Company and a private Peruvian party, the Company obtained the right to acquire up to a thirty-year leasehold interest in the Bongara zinc properties situated in northern Peru. The Bongara option area covers approximately 25,000 acres. The Company has acquired an additional 215,000 acres by staking. Most of this additional acreage is not subject to the underlying Bongara option.
Aggregate option payments of $70,000 were made and required work commitments of $750,000 were satisfied through 1996 in order to vest a 100% interest in the Bongara option. The Company has exercised its option for the conveyance of the property to the Company. The Bongara option also requires semiannual advance minimum royalty payments, beginning with a $20,000 payment on signing of the conveyance, increasing to a maximum of $50,000 three years thereafter and until commercial production is achieved. These payments are recoupable out of net sales value ("NSV") royalty payments made from commercial production, should such production be achieved. The NSV royalty, which is payable to the lessor, ranges from a minimum of 3%, subject to certain deductions for treatment and transportation costs, at zinc prices below $0.75 per pound, to a maximum of 5% at prices above $1.00 per pound.
In December 1996, the Company signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Cominco regarding the Bongara property, presently covering approximately 240,000 acres, which could, at Cominco's option, include the Bongara option property upon its conveyance. Cominco has the right to earn a 60% interest in the Bongara project by spending a minimum of $27,500,000 on exploration and development and by making cash payments of $1,800,000 to Solitario over a four- year period, as well as fully funding the project through a bankable feasibility study. An initial cash payment of $250,000 was paid by Cominco in January 1997. In addition to the cash payments and work commitments, Cominco has agreed to finance Solitario's share of project development costs, subject to repayment, after a production decision is made, should Solitario not secure third-party financing.
LOCATION. The Bongara property is situated approximately 350 kilometers by paved and gravel roads from the port city of Chiclayo to the southwest, in northern Peru. Most of the property lies within 10 miles of an improved gravel road with accesses to the coast. Travel within the project area is accomplished by foot or horseback along a log-skidding trail. The property falls on the east slope of the Andes at an average elevation of 2,000 meters.
GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION. The property is underlain by northwest-trending Jurrassic-Cretaceous-age carbonates, fine to coarse clastic sediments, and shales. Mapping conducted by the Company indicates that zinc mineralization occurs within carbonate rock units in which limestone has been significantly altered to dolomite.
Regional exploration has consisted of satellite imagery interpretation, stream sediment geochemistry, geologic mapping and stratigraphic analysis, detailed rock and soil geochemistry, and hand digging shallow prospect pits. Based on the results of this work, several new areas of zinc mineralization were identified in 1996.
In the fall of 1996, several significant outcroppings of zinc sulfide mineralization were located in Florida Canyon in the south central portion of the main Bongara claim block. Mineralization consists of at least four stratigraphically stacked rock horizons, each approximately 20 feet thick and containing zinc concentrations ranging from 7% to 16%. Within these high grade zinc zones, lead values generally average 1.0% and silver approximately 1.0 ounce per ton. No estimates of the potential size of Florida Canyon mineralization can be made until drilling commences.
MINERAL DEPOSITS. The main high-grade oxide zone consists of secondary zinc and lead carbonates which occur as a lateritic capping on the limestone surface. The maximum depth of the secondary zinc, as found in test pits, is 30 meters. To date, over 300 pits have been excavated over a length of 1,500 meters and a width of 300 meters on the Mina Grande and Mina Chica deposits. The pits range in depth from 1 to 33 meters and are spaced at 25 and 50 meter centers throughout the deposit.
Based on the assay results from these pits, a polygonal computer generated deposit estimate was made for the Mina Grande and Mina Chica areas. Combined, these deposits are estimated to contain 1.91 million metric tons grading 19.3% zinc and 2.2% lead. A cutoff grade of 7.5% combined lead plus zinc and a tonnage factor of approximately 16 cubic feet per ton were utilized.
YANACOCHA GOLD PROPERTY, CAJAMARCA DEPARTMENT, PERU
GENERAL. The Yanacocha property, located in northern Peru, is comprised of one contiguous block of approximately 155,000 acres located in the center of the Yanacocha district. A second smaller block of 10,000 acres is situated five miles to the northwest.
In May 1995, the Company signed an agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation ("Barrick"), giving Barrick the right to earn a 60% interest in the property by spending $6.25 million on exploration and making cash payments to the Company of $1.0 million over a four- year period. Upon signing, Barrick paid the Company $100,000 and completed a $1.0 million work commitment during the first year. In June 1996, Barrick elected to terminate the agreement, thereby relinquishing its interest in the property.
LOCATION. The Yanacocha Gold District lies in northern Peru's Cajamarca Department, 25 kilometers north of the historic provincial capital city of Cajamarca (population: 100,000). The Yanacocha district is a 1.5 hour drive north of Cajamarca on improved gravel roads. Elevations range from 2,800 meters at Cajamarca to 4,200 meters at the highest points in and around Yanacocha.
GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION. The property is located one mile north of South America's largest gold mine (1996 production of 811,000 ounces of gold), Newmont Mining Company's ("Newmont") 51%-owned and operated Yanacocha heap leach gold mine. Total proven and probable reserves at the Yanacocha mine have been reported by Newmont to be more than six million ounces of gold at the end of 1996. The Corona gold-copper porphyry deposit (three million ounces of gold and one billion pounds of copper) lies one mile north of the Company's property position.
Geologically, the Yanacocha district is situated in Tertiary-age volcanic terrain which extends from Cajamarca to the Ecuadorian border, 350 kilometers to the north-northwest. The volcanic rocks are underlain by Cretaceous basement consisting of carbonate and quartzite sedimentary rocks intruded by Cretaceous or Tertiary-age porphyritic intrusives. The gold mineralization present at Newmont's Yanacocha mine occurs within zones of silicified volcanic rocks. The gold and copper mineralization at the Corona deposit occurs in a typical Andean- style gold-copper porphyry setting within an altered intrusive body.
Work conducted by the Company and Barrick has consisted of geological mapping, rock and stream sediment geochemical sampling, helicopter-borne geophysical surveying, ground induced-polarization surveying and core drilling. This geological, geochemical and geophysical work indicates at least 14 areas (size as yet undetermined) of alteration and mineralization in both volcanic and sedimentary rocks.
Twenty-one drill holes totalling approximately 10,000 feet have been completed by the Company and Barrick during the past 18 months. Only three areas have been drill tested thus far. These are the Los Negritos, Shuito and Chalhuaquero gold prospects, all situated in the south-central portion of the claim block. Drilling has thus far intersected anomalous gold values and strong alteration.
EL TIGRE GOLD PROPERTY, LAMBAYEQUE DEPARTMENT, PERU
GENERAL. Solitario acquired an option to earn a 60% interest in the 18,000 acre El Tigre gold property in northern Peru from Britannia Gold Corp. ("Britannia") in April 1996. To earn its interest, Solitario must spend $900,000 on exploration and make $115,000 in cash payments to Britannia over a four-year period. Solitario has already completed its first and second year work commitments.
GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION. The property is underlain by Jurassic volcanic rocks that are intensely silicified in several locations. Surface work indicates the silicified rocks contain anomalous gold values that extend under a gravel pediment cover. Twenty-one drill holes were completed in 1996. Most of the drill holes contained significant thicknesses of anomalous gold with the best values being 113 feet grading 0.021 ounces of gold per ton. Additional drilling is planned for 1997.
LAS CARACHAS, SAN JUAN PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
The 22,000 acre Las Carachas property was initially acquired in 1993 and currently consists of three 100%-owned exploration cateos. One of the cateos was acquired in early 1996 from Minas Argentinas, S.A., through an option grant to earn a 100% interest, subject to a 2% NSR royalty, by spending $1,000,000 over a four-year period.
The property displays several intensely altered zones with anomalous gold within Tertiary volcanic rocks. Areas of high base metal and silver values occur peripheral to these structural zones. The Company drilled nine reverse circulation holes totalling approximately 3,000 feet in 1995. Five of the holes intersected sub-economic anomalous gold values.
In 1996, three core holes were completed on the Santa Rosa alteration zone. Two of the three holes intersected strongly altered rocks over widths ranging from 25 to 238 feet. These altered zones contained anomalous values of lead, zinc, silver and gold.
CANADA ONDA, SAN LUIS PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
GENERAL. In August 1996, Solitario signed an agreement with a private Argentine party to earn a 75% interest in the 5,000 acre Canada Onda property in the Province of San Luis, Argentina. To earn its interest, Solitario must spend $1,000,000 in exploration and make $250,000 in payments over a five-year period. Solitario has already competed its first two years of work commitments.
GEOLOGY AND EXPLORATION. The property is underlain by Precambrian metamorphic rocks intruded by Tertiary alkalic rocks. During the fall of 1996, initial exploration work consisted of surface geologic mapping and geochemical sampling, followed by reverse circulation drilling. Five holes totalling over 2,000 feet were completed. Two of the holes intersected 6.6 feet of high grade gold mineralization in excess of 1.2 ounces of gold per ton.
GUALILAN PROPERTY, SAN JUAN PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
In 1993, the Company acquired rights to the 25,000 acre Gualilan property from a private Argentine party. In 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Monarch Resources Investments Limited ("Monarch") entitling Monarch to earn a 51% interest in the property by making cash payments of $275,000 to the
Company and by spending $2,000,000 in exploration over a four-year period, including an October 1, 1996 payment of $300,000 to the underlying owner. In 1996, Monarch terminated the agreement, whereby the Company also elected to relinquish its interest in the properties.
CERRO NEGRO, SAN JUAN PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
The Cerro Negro property consists of two concessions totalling approximately 12,500 acres in the province of San Juan, northwestern Argentina. One concession was leased from a private Argentine party in July 1994 and the other was directly applied for by the Company. The primary geologic target on the Cerro Negro property is a gold-copper bearing tourmaline breccia. An intensive sampling program was carried out in late 1994 and drilling in 1995. Two of the five drill holes encountered significant copper mineralization with 170 feet grading 0.15% copper in one hole and 145 feet grading 0.22% copper in the other hole.
EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE OVERVIEW
During 1996, the Company conducted exploration activities on various of its properties incurring approximately $3.5 million in exploration expenditures, including $2.7 million in South America.
Several of the Company's properties are subject to leases and/or options to purchase. The Company's share of 1997 annual lease and rental obligations and option payments, for properties it currently holds, totals $336,000 as determined at December 31, 1996. Certain other mining claims and properties not subject to leases were acquired by the Company either by deed or were located by the Company. With respect to the claims and other properties acquired by deed or located by the Company, the obligation required to hold the claims is to pay ad valorem property taxes in the case of the patented mining claims and fee land, and annual rental fees in the case of the unpatented mining claims and concessions. See BUSINESS-TITLE.
1997 WORK COMMITMENTS
The Company's work commitments remaining to be fulfilled in 1997 is $375,000, all of which is expected to be fulfilled by its joint venture partners.

GLOSSARY OF MINING TERMS
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. Commercial production is defined in various ways in mineral joint ventures and mineral leases. The term generally refers to the first continuous production from a mining operation at or near the designed capacity of the facilities, for a period of one or more months, signifying the end of the development phase and the beginning of the mining phase of the operations.
PATENTED MINING CLAIM. Patented mining claim means a lode or placer mining claim for which the United States has conveyed fee title to the claim holder pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872. To obtain fee title, the claimant must prove the existence of a valuable mineral deposit within the boundaries of the claim and meet certain other conditions.
UNPATENTED MINING CLAIM. Unpatented mining claim means a claim to a valuable mineral deposit established by a company or individual on land owned by the United States, under the Mining Law of 1872, giving the owner the possessory right to develop and mine the mineral deposit. The term also includes non- mineral millsites located pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872. Paramount title to the land is owned by the United States.
LODE CLAIM. Lode claims have a maximum size of 1,500 feet by 600 feet and may be established on veins or other mineralization in
solid rock. The holder of each unpatented mining claim must pay a "claim maintenance fee" of $100 per claim on or before August 31 of each year through 1998. To locate new unpatented claims, the locator must pay a $100 per claim maintenance fee for the initial assessment year and a $25 per claim location fee. Until a valuable mineral deposit has been demonstrated to exist within an unpatented mining claim, the claim may be subject to challenge by third parties or by the United States.
PROVEN ORE RESERVES. That part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve estimation. Proven ore reserves are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
PROBABLE ORE RESERVES. That part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve estimation. Probable ore reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
MINERAL DEPOSIT. Mineral deposit means a mineralized body which has been physically delineated by drilling, underground tunneling, surface trenching and other workings and has been found to contain mineralized material with sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further evaluation. Such a mineralized body is not known to contain proven or probable ore reserves because sampling is not yet sufficiently detailed to reliably predict that the mineralized rock can be economically and legally mined. Any statement of the quantity of gold or other mineral believed to be present in any mineral deposit should be regarded as a preliminary estimate of the total quantity of the mineral present in the mineralized body, subject to change after further exploration and development work, and does not indicate that such quantity of mineral can be economically extracted.
FEASIBILITY STUDY. A definitive engineering estimate or calculation of all costs, revenues, equipment needs and production likely to be achieved when a mine is developed. The study is used to define the economic viability of a project and to support the search for project financing.
NET SMELTER RETURN ROYALTY. Net smelter return royalty is a royalty, payable in cash or in kind, based on the actual gold sales price received or gold produced less the cost of refining at an off-site refinery.
