The Company's principal office space is located at 1301 Avenue M, Cisco, Texas 76437. The office space is for corporate identification, mailing, and courier purposes and costs us approximately $3,200 a year to an affiliate. This $3,200 has been recorded as an expense and contributed capital in the financials.
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Company's overriding royalties total 495,838 net royalty acres under 14,661,454 gross surface acres in fourteen concessions. In addition the Company also owns 18,897 net royalty acres under 1,194,667 gross acres in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia and 428 net royalty acres under 160,618 gross acres in the Carnarvon Basin located offshore of the state of Western Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership and size of each concession.
The Eromanga Basin encompasses the southwestern portion of the State of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australia's main onshore producing oil and gas basin.
The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Company's overrides are in a prime location since the majority of the Company's interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent and is making approximately $A43 billion worth of oil, gas and associated hydrocarbons per year (equivalent to about $110 billion in U. S. dollars) based on an oil price of $40 per barrel.
On the 16,016,739 gross surface acres where ACOR holds overriding royalty interests, there are giant anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic highs, all of which indicate possibilities of oil and gas reserves. In addition, about $27 million worth of seismic information has been completed and is available on the areas.
The Company is currently receiving revenues from four of its overriding royalty interests - ATP 267, ATP 299, ATP 560 and PEL 115 and one of its working interests - PEL 100. A successful gas well was completed on ATP 543 in 1996. After completion of a gas pipeline, gas began to be marketed in August 1999, but the pipeline reduced the gas price and the well was shut in.
The Company has overriding royalty interests in three Permits in the Gippsland Basin, VIC/P45, 53 and 54. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964.
In addition to Company's large overriding royalty position it also has working interests in five concessions, of which four are located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin and one is in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. See the table for Working Interest Holdings for additional information.

The following is a summary of the Company's Australian properties divided into four areas: 1) Gippsland Basin - Victoria, 2) Carnarvon Basin of Western Australia, 3) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia, and 4) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland.;
BASS STRAIT OF THE GIPPSLAND BASIN
Seven wells were drilled on the Company's overriding royalties and working interests on oil and gas concessions located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait is located between the states of Victoria and Tasmania, known for its prolific production. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests on which drilling occurred:
VIC/P45
VIC/P45 is an offshore concession covering 214,896 gross acres under which the Company holds a 7.5% of 1% of gross production. This concession is located in the most prolific oil-producing basin in Australia, approximately 1.5 miles east of the Kingfish Oil Field in the southern Gippsland Basin in the Bass Straits. The Kingfish Oil Field, the largest oil field in Australia, has produced over one billion barrels of oil since its discovery. There are currently 23 producing wells, and 41 total wells were drilled in this field. Apache drilled one well on VIC/P45, which was plugged and abandoned. The operator has requested a one-year extension to conduct further studies on VIC/P45.
VIC/P53
VIC/P53 is an offshore concession covering 182,858 gross acres under which the Company holds a 15% of 1% of gross production. Drilling began in the fourth quarter of 2008 on VIC/53 to test the Bazzard structure that was identified by 3-D seismic. The well was drilled by Apache and encountered oil and gas shows but was not commercial. The well was plugged and abandoned. It should be noted that this concession is totally surrounded by huge offshore oil and gas fields that have produced in excess of 2.8 billion barrels of oil and 5 trillion cubic feet of gas to date. Six prospects were also identified during the 3-D seismic program.
VIC/P54
VIC/P54 is an offshore concession covering 155,676 gross acres under which the Company holds a 5% of 1% of gross production. On December 23, 2004 the operator began drilling the Grayling 1-A on VIC/54. The operator confirmed three gas columns in the well from the well log analysis. The wire-line logs provided sufficient data regarding the reservoir quality and hydrocarbon composition of the Golden Beach reservoirs not to warrant drill stem testing. Given its proximity to Longtom, another gas discovery on the area, gas at the Grayling location may provide additional reserves for a future development in VIC/P54.
The Longtom-3, drilled and completed during the summer of 2006, clearly demonstrated that wells can be drilled in the field that will enable the production of gas at commercial rates. Two production tests were conducted on the well:
The first test produced gas from the 400 sand at 23MMscf/d. The results from this test confirm the flow potential of the 400 sand reservoir in the Longtom field, addressing a major concern leading up to the drilling of the Longtom-3 well. A flow was not achieved in the second test of Longtom-2 (conducted over the 400 sand). Nexus has interpreted this test as having failed due to down-hole mechanical problems.
The second test, over the 100, 200 and 300 sand intervals in the horizontal hole section exceeded expectations producing an estimated 77MMcf/d when bypassing the test separator and 59MMcf/d when flowing through the test separator (the separator's flow capacity). Sampling during the test recorded expected levels of carbon dioxide (less than 1%) and less than one part per million hydrogen sulphide.
In addition, the second test indicated that the condensate yield is higher in the 100 sands than in the sands above it, which will provide an economic boost to the project.
The Longtom-4 development well was drilled during the summer of 2008. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet. The first gas from the Longtom Gas Field is forecasted to begin during the middle part of 2009. A 12" pipeline is currently under construction on this area.
VIC/P59
VIC/P59 consists of 301,468 gross acres and is located offshore in the Gippsland Basin under which the Company holds 1,206 net royalty acres representing a 1/20th of 1% overriding royalty interest. VIC/P59 is adjoined by the Blackback Oil Field with estimated reserves of 80,000,000 barrels of oil. Apache drilled three wells in 2008 on VIC/P59. Two wells were plugged and abandoned and the results of the third well has not been reported as of the date of this report.
VIC/P60
VIC/P60 is an offshore concession covering 339,769 gross acres under which the Company now holds a 50% of 1% overriding royalty interest under this entire concession following the farm-out to Holloman Energy Corp. In April 2005, the Company conducted a study of the data on VIC/P60 that identified six (6) structures, of which one of the six (6) structures, the A-1 Prospect lies in 100-200 meters of shallow water. The A-1 prospect is approximately 4.97 miles long and 1.24 miles wide with a seismic bright spot anomaly rated good to excellent. The seismic bright spot is 108' thick and 820' horizontal by 20,500' perpendicular wide behind a fault on the flank of the anticline. Holloman has traced the beds to the nearest oil and gas fields after processing 5,000 +/- seismic lines.
In 2007 the Company sold its 25% working interest for $152,896 in cash and retained an overriding royalty interest of 50% of 1% in concession VIC/P60. During 2008 Holloman filed a request for an extension for additional time to evaluate the escalation of the 3-D seismic costs that have occurred since the execution of the agreement to perform the work program.
CARNARVON BASIN - WESTERN AUSTRALIA
The Carnarvon Basin is Australia's largest petroleum providence. The Carnarvon basin in the Northwest Shelf contains a number of giant gas and gas-condensate fields. The Greater Gorgon area, which includes other nearby gas fields, is 130 km off the northwest coast of Western Australia in the Carnarvon basin. The fields in that area contain in excess of 40 Trillion Cubic Feet of gas.
In 2007, Western Australia produced 126 million barrels of crude oil/condensate, and 30 billion cubic meters of gas. 65% of the gas was transformed into 12 million tonnes of LNG (all of which was exported), with the remainder of the gas being sold to users in Western Australia. Primary production by the industry was valued at $16.7 billion, accounting for 31% of all natural resources produced in the state.
WA 372 & WA 373
WA 372 and WA 373 are both offshore concessions covering 61,776 gross acres and 98,842 gross acres respectively. The Company holds a 1/30th% of 1% overriding royalty interest under both of these concessions. Both WA 372 & WA 373 are operated by Holloman Energy Corp. and are located close to some giant oil & gas discoveries. The western border of WA 372 & 373 is approximately 10 kilometers from the Woolybutt Oil Field, which is currently producing approximately 24,000 barrels of oil per day or $604,800,000 per year at current market prices.
The eastern border of WA 372 is approximately 10 kilometers from the Barrow Island Oil Field, Australia's largest oil field with approximately 1.25 Billion barrels of oil in place or $87,500,000,000 at current market prices. The Barrow Oil Field has already produced approximately 300,000,000 barrels of oil or $21,000,000,000 at current market prices.
The operator of WA 372 has an $A41,000,000 exploration program that includes drilling 2 wells within the 1st three years with an option to drill an additional 2 wells in years 4 thru 6. The estimated cost to drill one well is in excess of $A10,000,000.
The operator of WA 373 has an $A20,000,000 exploration program that includes drilling 2 wells within the 1st three years. The estimated cost to drill one well is in excess of $A10,000,000.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - SOUTH AUSTRALIA
PEL 88
ACOR owns a 3/10ths of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 88, which covers 816,436 gross acres. Three prospects have been identified on PEL 88, Acacia, Casuarina and Lancier. The potential recoverable reserves of each of these prospects are 15,000,000 barrels of oil in the Acacia, 18,000,000 barrels of oil in the Casuarina and 48,000,000 barrels of oil in the Lancier. No assurance can be made that these prospects will be drilled.
PEL 100
ACOR holds a 1% working interest in the Cleansweep #1 which was drilled in the 2008 fiscal year and was completed as a Birkhead formation producer. The well tested on 444 barrels of oil on a drill stem test. The Cleansweep well was drilled to a total depth of 8,694 feet and is estimated to have the potential of 4.8 million barrels of recoverable oil in place.
PEL 111
ACOR owns a 1/10th of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 111, which covers 290,101 gross acres. Mapping of PEL 111 seismic data coupled with the reprocessing of existing seismic data identified 20 leads and prospects for potential oil and gas in the Birkhead, Hutton, Tirrawarra and Patchawarra formations. The Warhawk #1 was drilled in 2008 and was cased and suspended as a future producer.
The operator states that a 3-D seismic program, followed by a 3 well drilling program on this area, is planned during 2009.
PEL 112 & 444
On June 21, 2006, ACOR signed a farm-out agreement with Holloman Corporation of Odessa, Texas for the oil & gas exploration of ACOR's PELs 108, 109, & 112, located in South Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. ACOR retained a 13.8325% carried working interest through the drilling and completion of the first 3 wells under PELs 108, 109, & 112.
Holloman Corp. agreed to drill and complete 3 wells to earn 66.667% working interest in all 3 areas. Holloman Corp. will carry ACOR for 13.8325% in the first three wells. After the third well, ACOR will pay its part of any future exploration performed on the 3 areas, subject to the terms of the Joint Operating Agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Holloman drilled the Pecos #1 well on PEL 112 being the first of the three well program. The Pecos #1 was completed as a dry hole. Due to inconsistencies between the original seismic interpretation and drilling data, Holloman tendered a request for an extension of the work program to determine future drilling prospects, already identified, so as to maximize the potential of the program.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, Holloman made a request to the South Australian Government for new exploration terms, which was approved giving a new five-year work program for PEL 112 and consolidating PEL 108 & 109 to a new exploration permit PEL 444. The Company's terms and conditions mentioned above remain in force on these two permits.
PEL 115
This permit covers 270,580 gross acres under which ACOR holds an overriding royalty interest of 10% of 1% of gross production. PEL 115 is located in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. The Mirage-1 well completed in July 2005 initially flowed clean oil at rate of 372 barrels of oil per day on a 1/2 inch choke. Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet.
The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately 20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the north-east. Such an area has the potential of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir.
In the southern part of PEL 115, interpretation of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra and Thunderbolt). In the northern part of PEL 115 two Jurassic prospects have been identified (Avro and Skyhawk) and three Permian prospects known as the Delta, Hurricane and Metear. No drilling dates have been announced for these prospects.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - QUEENSLAND
ATP 267
An eleven well exploration, appraisal and development drilling campaign began in early 2007 on ATP 267 under which the Company holds an overriding royalty interest of 17.15% of 1%. ATP 267 covers approximately 220,800 gross acres. The Nockatunga oil fields located on ATP 267 under which the Company holds a 17.15% of 1% overriding royalty interest is operated by Santos Ltd. The Nockatunga field produced an average of approximately 750 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) during the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
The Maxwell 5 appraisal well, which was drilled in October 2007 on the Maxwell oil field in PL 50, approximately equidistant from Maxwell 3 and Maxwell 4, was tied into the field facilities and brought online in April 2008. The well produces oil from the Murta Member.
ATP 299
The Company owns a .0575% of 1% ORRI under ATP-299 and its Petroleum Licenses which covers 441,600 gross acres and currently has 102 completed wells under which ACOR receives overriding royalties. The Tintaburra Block is reported to contain approximately 84 million barrels of proved plus probable oil in place. The 2006 program included the development of the Mulberry Field, which could potentially recover an additional 20 million barrels of oil from the Block.
Twenty-three (23) were drilled in the Tintaburra Block in 2006. Of the twenty-three (23), there were three (3) plugged and abandoned. Initial production rates from these wells average 200 barrels of oil per day. Production is expected to increase as more of the successful wells are brought on-line and as the wells receive pressure support from the nearby water injection wells.
Nine (9) additional Tintaburra wells were added in 2007 to the number of producing wells on ATP 299 increasing the total number of productive wells to 102. Also during 2007 four wells were drilled from a single pad and all encountered the primary target, the Mid-Birkhead reservoir with reservoir thickness ranging from 5 to 15 meters. These wells are being used to accelerate production and improve sweeping efficiency in the Mid-Birkhead reservoir.
The program so far has been the most successful onshore oil-drilling program undertaken in Australia with a success rate for drilling in the mid Birkhead reservoir unit at 80 acre spacing continuing at in excess of 80%.
ATP 560
ATP 560 covers 625,600 acres under which the Company holds a 25% of 1% override. The Utopia Oil Field is situated in ATP 560P in the Eromanga Basin in southwest Queensland, approximately 150 km north east of the Jackson Oilfield and 50 km south of the Kenmore Oilfield. The Joint Venture is considering numerous options to accelerate production from the field. The Utopia field is a broad low-relief structure, with a maximum relief of approximately 10 m. The field produces from the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation and is the largest known Murta pool in the Queensland Eromanga Basin. The oil pool is at an approximate depth of 1020 m. The most recent technical review of Utopia undertaken in June 2004 determined the field could contain up to 2.86 million barrels of recoverable oil.
ATP 582
On March 30, 2006 ACOR began work on the geological studies on ACOR's ATP-582. ATP-582 is located in Queensland Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. The permit area covers approximately 6,716,000 gross acres. The Southern zone of ATP-582 is currently the best part of the area for oil and gas exploration. Besides being up dip of the approximately $1 billion dollar annual production from the Santos-Exxon producing block, it is along strike with many new discovery wells that have sustained daily production of 1,000 - 3,000 barrels of oil per day. ACOR management has currently identified two prospects on ATP-582 from the 850 miles seismic data, owned by ACOR. Two prospects have been identified:
The Samphire prospect covers approximately 3,800 acres and exhibits approximately 110 feet of closure. It is possible that a good potential exists for a 10-15 million barrel field, with a possible potential of approximately 40 million barrels.
The Samphire West, which covers around 4,700 acres. If the Samphire prospect proves to be productive, a number of additional field discoveries may result from leads in the Southern part of ATP-582. Both prospects are a series of sandstone (clastic) reservoirs of pinch-outs and structural traps that have formed on the flank of the local high.
On September 26th, 2006 the Company entered into a Joint Venture arrangement where the partner will operate the concession, pay to obtain Native Title clearance, shoot a new seismic grid survey over the leads identified by ACOR management from old seismic data to confirm good drillable targets with plans to drill a well to earn a 50% working interest under ATP 582 (ACOR will be carried for 50% WI). No exploration work can begin until native title has been cleared.
ITEM 3.
