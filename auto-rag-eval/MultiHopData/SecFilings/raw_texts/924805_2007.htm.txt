Item 2. Properties
We currently own a 100% interest in a license to use subsurface mineral resources and a hydrocarbon exploration contract issued by the ROK in 1999 and 2000, respectively (collectively referred to herein as the “license” or the “contract”). The original contract granted us the right to engage in exploration and development activities in an area of approximately 200 square kilometers referred to herein as the ADE Block. The ADE Block is comprised of three fields, the Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Emir fields. During our 2006 fiscal year our exploration contract was expanded to include an additional 260 kilometers of land adjacent to the ADE Block, which we refer to as the “Extended Territory. The Extended Territory is governed by the terms of the original contract. The ADE Block and the Extended Territory are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “our properties.”
When initially granted, the exploration and development stage of the contract had a five year term. The time for exploration and development was then extended to July 9, 2007, with the right to seek an additional two-year extension. In February 2007, the MEMR granted our request for extension of our exploration contract. Under the terms of the contract extension, the exploration period will extend to July 2009 over the entire exploration contract territory.
Under the terms of our contract we have the right to gather and sell all oil and natural gas we produce in test production until the expiration of our exploration contract, as extended, with the revenue from such sales belonging to BMB.
Under the statutory scheme in the Republic of Kazakhstan prospective oil fields are developed in two stages. The first stage is an exploration and appraisal stage during which a private contractor, such as BMB, is given a license to explore for oil and gas on a territory for a set term of years. During this stage the primary focus is on the search for a commercial discovery, i.e., a discovery of a sufficient quantity of oil and gas to make it commercially feasible to pursue execution of, or transition to, a production contract with the government.
In order to be assured that adequate exploration activities are undertaken by the contractor, the MEMR establishes an annual mandatory minimum work program to be accomplished in each year of the exploration contract. Under the minimum work program the contractor is required to invest a minimum dollar amount in exploration activities on the contract territory that may include geophysical studies, construction of field infrastructure or drilling activities. During the exploration stage, the contractor is also required to drill sufficient wells to establish the existence of commercially producible reserves in any structure for which it seeks a commercial production license. Failure to complete the minimum work program during the term of an exploration contract could preclude a contractor from receiving a longer-term production contract, regardless the success of the contractor in proving commercial reserves during the partial fulfillment of the minimum work program. Therefore, completion of the exploration contract’s minimum work program is essential to the success of any oil company working in Kazakhstan.
The contract we hold follows the above format. The contract sets the minimum dollar amount we must expend through July 2009:

Under the rules of the MEMR there is an option for our expenditures above the minimum requirements in one period to be carried over to meet minimum obligations in future periods. As the above chart shows we have exceeded the minimum expenditure requirement in each period of the contract. In connection with the recent extension grant, the MEMR required an additional capital expenditures of $16,750,000 through the end of the extension period. We expect our planned drilling activities through 2009 to exceed the new amounts added to our minimum work program.
As noted above, from June 2006 through March 31, 2007 we invested approximately $37.4 million in the exploration and development of our properties. During the year ended March 31, 2007, we incurred and capitalized expenses of approximately $18.4 million attributable to drilling activities at the Kariman-1, Kariman-2, Dolinnoe-6 and Emir-6 wells during the year, as discussed in more detail below. We also incurred and capitalized approximately $6.2 million in well workover expenses, almost $1.3 million in geological and geophysical works and $9.5 million in materials used in exploration and development activities. Such capitalized costs are recorded as oil and gas properties on our balance sheet as at March 31, 2007. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The second aspect of the mandatory minimum work program is the requirement that we drill a sufficient number of wells on any structure for which we seek commercial production rights to support our claim of a commercial discovery within the structure. Typically, one exploratory well and two appraisal wells are sufficient to support such a claim, although in some cases, commercial reserves have been demonstrated with fewer wells. The number of wells to be drilled is generally determined by the number of structures identified by the seismic studies done on a territory. The 3D seismic studies of our contract territory, as extended, have identified six potential structures. Therefore, we anticipate the need to drill up to 18 wells during the exploration phase of our contract as reflected on the top half of the following chart:
The bottom half of the above chart shows our current progress on drilling of exploratory and appraisal wells, the second aspect of our mandatory minimum work program. As the chart shows, for purposes of meeting the minimum work program requirements, we have nine wells completed and three wells currently in progress.
To date we have been conservative in our approach to exploration. It has been our practice to drill our first few wells serially. Our first well was the Dolinnoe-2 well drilled in 2004. This was followed by the Dolinnoe-3 well, and then the Aksaz-4 and Kariman-1 wells. We have verified the presence of oil and gas in all our wells thus far. We have expended substantial time and money to study our wells very closely.
It is important to remember that the purpose of the exploration stage is to study the geology and geophysical characteristics of each field and individual wells, with a view to qualifying for a longer-term production contract. Once drilling of a well is completed, our emphasis focuses on an extended period of testing a well’s production characteristics and capacities to determine the best method for producing oil from a well and to gain insight into the further development of the entire field. During this stage of exploration, oil production is subject to wide fluctuations caused by varying pressures commonly experienced by new wells and by significant periods of well closure to accommodate various mandatory testing. Maximizing oil production only becomes the central focus during the post-exploration phase when exploiting the commercial discovery commences under a production contract.
In addition to the wells currently in progress, we anticipate the need to complete up to eight additional wells by the end of the term of our exploration contract in order to qualify for a commercial production license on each of our structures. This will require that we continue to accelerate our drilling activities during the next two years if we wish to obtain commercial production rights for each of the structures within our properties.
Under our contract, we have the exclusive right to apply for and negotiate a commercial production contract. The government is required to negotiate the terms of these rights in good faith in accordance with the Law of Petroleum of Kazakhstan. Based on discussions with the MEMR, the primary factors used by the MEMR in determining whether to grant commercial production rights are whether the contract holder has fulfilled the minimum work program commitments, proved the existence of a commercial discovery and submitted and received approval of a development plan prepared by a third-party petroleum institute in Kazakhstan for the exploitation of the established commercial reserves. All our efforts during exploration stage have and will continue to focus on meeting these criteria. We have not yet applied for commercial production rights because we enjoy certain economic advantages during exploration and development.
The terms of our commercial production rights and royalty rates will be negotiated at the time we apply to move to commercial production. During exploration and development stage, we have the right to produce and sell oil and natural gas at a royalty rate of 2%. When we move to commercial production, the negotiated royalty rates may change depending on reserves and production rates. Royalty rates are established by the taxing authorities of the ROK and are based on production rates; the rate increases on a sliding scale. Current royalty rates range for 2% to 6%. We also anticipate that we will be required to pay rent export tax when we move to commercial production. The current rent export tax rate is tied to the Brent oil price; the rate increases on a sliding scale, at the present time it is 33%. Under our contract during exploration stage we are not required to pay rent export tax on the oil we sell to the world markets. We anticipate that at the time we move to commercial production, the government will impose the rent export tax on all oil and natural gas we sell outside the domestic market in Kazakhstan.
Drilling Operations
The following table sets forth our drilling activity for the years ended March 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007. In the table, “Gross” refers to the total wells in which we have a working interest or back-in working interest after payout and “Net” refers to gross wells multiplied by our working interest therein.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we took steps to secure drilling rigs to allow us to accelerate our drilling activities over previous years. In January 2006 we signed one-year contracts with Great Wall, a Chinese drilling company, and Oil and Gas Exploration Krakow, a Polish drilling company, to furnish heavy rigs of sufficient size to drill wells to the depth of 4,000 meters, which is generally our target depth in Triassic carbonate structures. We also signed a turnkey contract with KandyagashBurService, LLP, a Kazakhstani drilling company, for drilling of new wells on the Emir oil field. In addition, we hired Great Wall to provide a lighter rig we use for completion, workover and testing activities on completed wells. Fiscal 2007 was the first year when we engaged in drilling several wells simultaneously compared to our drilling strategy in the past when we drilled wells serially.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we drilled to deepen the Kariman-1 well, completed drilling of Dolinnoe-6 and Kariman-2 well and continued drilling of Emir-6 well. We also continued testing and development works on the Dolinnoe-1, Dolinnoe- 2, Dolinnoe- 3, Emir -1 and Aksaz -1 and Aksaz-4 wells.
In February 2006 we commenced drilling in the Extended Territory. Our initial project was increasing the depth of an existing non-producing well, which is designated as the Kariman-1 well. Drilling operations were conducted by Oil and Gas Exploration Kracow, Poland. The
Kariman-1 well was cased to a depth of 1,661 meters and drilled to a total depth of 3,069 meters in 1967 by the Soviet government. Drilling was suspended at that depth because it was believed that the oil-bearing formations would not be found deeper than the lower Jurassic formations.
Our study of more recent advanced geological and geophysical information indicated that oil-bearing formations in the Kariman field are expected at a depth of 3,600 to 3,800 meters, through the Triassic formation. During reaming of the existing wellbore we discovered that the technical condition of the well had deteriorated significantly from the condition described in the original drilling logs. Because of the poor conditions within the wellbore, we began a sidetrack at 1,660 meters and essentially drilled a new bore from that depth.
Upon penetration the Middle Triassic formation between 3,356 and 3,361 meters we encountered very high formation pressure, additional intensive oil shows and a substantial increase in the gas content in drilling fluid. Therefore, as a safety precaution, we compensated by increasing drilling fluid weight. The increased weight of the required drilling fluid allowed us to determine that the Middle Triassic formation is characterized by abnormally high pressure of approximately 600 atmospheres.
Due to the high weight of the drilling fluid, beginning at 3,361 meters there was a loss circulation within the wellbore. Analysis of electric logging data determined that the loss circulation area was located at a depth of 1,660-1,860 meters. Therefore, we separated the loss circulation from the inflow by installing a cement plug and running casing to the depth of 3,100 meters.
Due to high pressure and strong degassing of drilling fluid in the penetrated portion of the Middle Triassic formations, our operations managers stopped drilling at a depth of 3,361 meters and retained Kezbie, a Kazakhstani company to commence well completion operations. Completion operations were followed by limited testing of a portion of the Kariman-1 well. The tests have been conducted in the open wellbore without perforation of the Upper Triassic formation, despite the fact that the flows from this horizon were partially locked by drilling fluid preliminary testing conducted during the first three days of testing yielded results ranging from 380 to 570 barrels per day.
Despite encouraging preliminary results of testing in the open wellbore, we decided to shut the well until arrival of a liner, smaller-diameter casing. The equipment has been procured and the casing was run-in during February-March of 2007. We intend to commence completion operations followed by extensive testing of the Upper Triassic sandstone formations during the first quarter of the 2008 fiscal year.
During the summer of 2007 we commenced drilling operations on three wells simultaneously, Kariman-2, Dolinnoe-6 and Borly -2.
Kariman-2, the first well drilled by us from surface, was spudded on August 15, 2006, by company contractor, Oil and Gas Exploration Krakow. The well is located 500 meters to the south of the Kariman-1 well. Drilling of the Kariman-2 was finished on December 25, 2006, with the final depth of 3,535 meters upon reaching the end of the targeted Middle Triassic horizons. Completion operations were completed by Burgylau LLP, a local contractor, during January 2007. We commenced testing of the well in February 2007. Since then the well has been steadily test producing with the range between 1,400 and 1,700 bpd on a 6mm choke.
Dolinnoe-6 well was spudded by our drilling contractor, Great Wall (China), on August 8, 2006. The well is located 800 meters to the southeast of the Dolinnoe-3 well drilled by the Company in 2005. Drilling operations were completed on January 23, 2007, with the final depth of 3,883 meters. Completion operations were subcontracted to Burgylau LLP and were carried out during March and April 2007. Completion operations were commenced at the end of March-beginning of April. We expect to continue intensive testing activities during the first quarter and to announce results of such testing upon receiving detailed information.
On July 5, 2006, our drilling contractor, Great Wall, has placed a 150-ton rig on Borly-2, well drilled to a depth of 2,382 meters during 1995 by MangyshlakMunaiGas, a subsidiary of the Kazakhstani National Oil and Gas Company. The well was previously cased to a depth of 1,900 meters. During the process we made a decision to cease and postpone re-entry operations on the well until a heavier rig becomes available.
On October 2, 2006, our third drilling contractor, KanyagashBurService LLP (KBS), completed mobilization of a 175-ton drilling rig and spudded a new well, designated Emir-6, on the Emir oil field. We signed a turnkey contract with the KBS for drilling of this well with a target depth of 3,100 meters. We expect drilling, completion and testing operations to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
Production
The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of March 31, 2007.
As of the end of the 2007 fiscal year we had nine wells in workover, testing or test production. According to the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, we are required to test every prospective object on our properties separately, this includes the completion of well surveys on different modes with various choke sizes on each horizon.
In the course of well testing, when the transfer from object to object occurs, the well must be shut in; oil production ceases for the period of mobilization/ demobilization of the workover rig, pull out of the hole, run in the hole, perforation, packer installation time, etc. This has the effect of artificially diminishing production rates averaged over a set period of time.
Our production figures for the month of March 2007 covering production from the ADE block and Kariman field in the extended license territory were as following: daily total high production was 2,693 bpd; daily total low production was 1,946 bpd with an average daily total production for the 31 days of March of 2,337 bpd. Because this only accounts for one zone per well, this may not be representative of the cumulative total production rate from all of the tested intervals in each of the wells.
Following is a brief description of the current production status of each of our nine wells and the Emir-6 well, which is nearing completion of drilling.
Aksaz -1
This well is currently not producing. Prior to workover, four producing intervals were tested. The single interval test production rates in Aksaz-1 using a 10 mm diameter choke was 140 bpd. We expect to undertake workover operations on this well, consisting primary of fishing works, once the workover rig will become available following testing of the Dolinnoe-6, Kariman-1 and Emir-6 wells.
Aksaz - 4
Drilling of this well was completed in August 2005. Two producing intervals have been tested. Current production rates from single interval testing using a 6 mm diameter choke ranges from 76 to 107 bpd.
Dolinnoe - 1
During the third quarter of fiscal 2007 we conducted workover operations on this well and it is currently producing. Production rates from single interval testing using a 6 mm diameter choke ranges from 221 to 438 bpd.
Dolinnoe - 2
This well is also producing. Current production rates from single interval testing using a 8 mm diameter choke ranges from 32 to 290 bpd.
Dolinnoe - 3
This well was initially completed to a depth of 3,800 meters in September 2005. During initial testing, we were able to perforate only 17 of 24 meters of the producing interval because of intensive oil and gas shows. Subsequent perforation of the remaining 7 meters of the interval was disrupted when tubing was impacted by the heavy drilling mud components, and the blowout preventer was damaged, which required the forced killing of the well. Although we were able to restore limited oil production from the well, the production was substantially lower than the well’s initial test production performance. We have conducted numerous tests during the past six months in an effort to increase daily production rates to levels consistent with management expectations. In August 2006 we completed the acid treatment of the Dolinnoe-3 well. During the ten days following completion of the acid treatment the well produced between 460 and 630 bpd while being tested using chokes between 6mm and 10mm in size. We believe these initial test results indicate that we have developed a suitable hydrochloric acid formula to conduct effective acid treatment of the carbonate formations with temperature and pressure conditions characterized by the Dolinnoe field. Current production rates from single interval testing using an 8 mm diameter choke range from 170 to 347 bpd. We plan to continue application of acid treatment to Dolinnoe field wells to stimulate production from such wells.
Dolinnoe - 6
Drilling of the Dolinnoe-6 well was completed on January 23, 2007. This well was drilled through the full Middle Triassic layer to a depth of 3,883 meters. Completion activities have been performed and testing of the well commenced in the third week of March. Stable production estimates will not be available until conclusion of the testing period.
Emir - 1
This well currently is not producing. Single interval production from this well prior to workover was 1.3 to 9.5 bpd.
Emir - 6
Drilling of the Emir-6 well has been completed on June 2, 2007. This well was drilled to a depth of 3,197 meters. Completion activities have been performed and we anticipate perforating the well within the next two weeks. Following perforation of the well, we will begin the testing.
Kariman - 1
Re-entry of the Kariman-1 well was completed on June 30, 2006 and well completion to the upper Triassic formation was completed by July 17, 2006. Despite the fact that the flows from this horizon are partially blocked by drilling fluid, preliminary testing conducted during the first month of testing using chokes ranging from 20 mm to 30 mm yielded results ranging from 380 to 570 barrels per day. The well was then put into a pressure-build up test to better understand the source of the high pressures encountered during earlier re-entry operations at the upper four meters of Middle Triassic formation. We have obtained and run down a specialized low diameter casing in the well. Perforation and subsequent testing of Upper Triassic sandstone formations are scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Kariman - 2
This well was spudded on August 15, 2006, and is the first well we have drilled from the surface in the Kariman oil field. Drilling of the Kariman-2 well was finished on December 25, 2006. Drilling operations were concluded at the depth of 3,535 meters, upon reaching the end of the targeted Middle Triassic horizons.
Well completion activities were conducted utilizing a drilling rig specifically employed for workover and completion operations. Subsequent testing of the well during the months of February and March yielded test production ranging from 996 to 1,859 bpd with steady production in the range of 1,4000 to 1,7000 bpd. We plan to continue test production from this well.
