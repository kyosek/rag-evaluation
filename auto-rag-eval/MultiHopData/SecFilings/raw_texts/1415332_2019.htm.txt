Fish Lake Valley Property
Fish Lake Valley is a lithium/boron/potassium enriched playa (also known as a salar, or salt pan), which is located in northern Esmeralda County in west central Nevada, and the area of greatest interest is roughly centered at 417050E 4195350N (NAD 27 CONUS). After staking numerous new claims in 2016 we currently hold 143, nominally 80-acre Association Placer claims that cover approximately 11,360 acres (4,597 hectares). Lithium-enriched Tertiary-era Fish Lake formation rhyolitic tuffs or ash flow tuffs have accumulated in a valley or basinal environment. Over time interstitial formational waters in contact with these tuffs, have become enriched in lithium, boron and potassium which could possibly be economic, and amenable to extraction by evaporative methods.
The property was originally held under mining lease purchase agreement dated June 1, 2009, between Nevada Lithium Corporation, and Nevada Alaska Mining Co. Inc., Robert Craig, Barbara Craig, and Elizabeth Dickman. Nevada Lithium issued to the vendors $350,000 worth of common stock of our company in eight regular disbursements. All disbursements were made of stock worth a total of $350,000, and claim ownership was transferred to our company.
The geological setting at Fish Lake Valley is highly analogous to the salars of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, and more importantly Clayton Valley, where Albemarle has its Silver Peak lithium-brine operation. Access is excellent in Fish Lake Valley with all-weather gravel roads leading to the property from state highways 264, and 265, and maintained gravel roads ring the playa. Power is available approximately 10 miles from the property, and the village of Dyer is approximately 12 miles to the south, while the town of Tonopah, Nevada is approximately 50 miles to the east.
Our company completed a number of geochemical and geophysical studies on the property, and conducted a short drill program on the periphery of the playa in the fall of 2010. Near-surface brine sampling during the spring of 2011 outlined a boron/lithium/potassium anomaly on the northern portions of the northern playa, that is roughly 1.3 x 2 miles long, which has a smaller higher grade core where lithium mineralization ranges from 100 to 150 mg/L (average 122.5 mg/L), with boron ranging from 1,500 to 2,670 mg/L (average 2,219 mg/L), and potassium from 5,400 to 8,400 mg/L (average 7,030 mg/L). Wet conditions on the playa precluded drilling there in 2011, and for a good portion of 2012, however a window of opportunity presented itself in late fall 2012. In November/December 2012 we conducted a short direct push drill program on the northern end of the playa, wherein a total of 1,240.58 feet (378.09 meters) was drilled in 20 holes at 17 discrete sites, and an area of 3,356 feet (1,023 meters) by 2,776 feet (846 meters) was systematically explored by grid probing. The deepest hole was 81 feet (24.69 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 34 feet (10.36 meters). The average depth of the holes drilled during the program was 62 feet (18.90 meters). The program successfully demonstrated that lithium-boron-potassium-enriched brines exist to at least 62 feet (18.9 meters) depth in sandy or silty aquifers that vary from approximately three to ten feet (one to three meters) in thickness. Average lithium, boron and potassium contents of all samples are 47.05 mg/L, 992.7 mg/L, and 0.535% respectively, with lithium values ranging from 7.6 mg/L to 151.3 mg/L, boron ranging from 146 to 2,160.7 mg/L, and potassium ranging from 0.1 to 1.3%. The anomaly outlined by the program is 1,476 by 2,461 feet (450 meters by 750 meters), and is not fully delimited, as the area available for probing was restricted due to soft ground conditions to the east and to the south. A 50 mg/L lithium cutoff is used to define this anomaly and within this zone average lithium, boron and potassium contents are 90.97 mg/L, 1,532.92 mg/L, and 0.88% respectively. On September 3, 2013, we announced that drilling had commenced at Fish Lake Valley. Due to storms and wet conditions in the area that our company had hoped to concentrate on, the playa was not passable, and so the program concentrated on larger step-out drilling well off the playa. This 11 hole, 1,025 foot program did prove that mineralization does not extend much, if at all, past the margins of the playa, as none of the fluids encountered in this program were particularly briny, and returned values of less than 5 mg/L lithium.
Results from the work done in the past by Lithium Corporation have been very positive, and our company believes that the playa at Fish Lake Valley may be conducive to the formation of a “Silver Peak” style lithium brine deposit.

Early in 2016 the company signed an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1032701 B.C. Ltd., a private British Columbia company with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium brine property, wherein 1032701 B.C. Ltd., may acquire an initial 80% undivided interest in the Fish Lake Valley property through the payment of an aggregate of US$300,000 in cash, completing a “Going Public Transaction” on or before May 6, 2016, and subject to the completion of the “Going Public Transaction, arranging for the issuance of a total of 400,000 common shares in the capital of the resulting issuer as follows: (i) within five business days following the effective date,
·
Pay $100,000 to our company and issue 200,000 common shares of the TSX-V listed public company.
·
On or before the first anniversary of the signing of the Definitive Agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company.
·
On or before the second anniversary of the signing of the definitive agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company.
The Optionee must make qualified exploration or development expenditures on the property of $200,000 before the first anniversary, an additional $300,000 before the second anniversary, an additional $600,000 prior to the third anniversary, and make all payments and perform all other acts to maintain the Property in good standing before fully earning their 80% interest. Additionally, after the initial earn-in the Optionee has the right for up to 12 months to purchase our 20% interest in the property for $1,000,000, at which point our interest would revert to a 2 1/2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Optionee may then elect at any time to purchase one half (1.25%) of our NSR for $1,000,000.
American Lithium Corp. subsequently acquired 100% of 1032701 BC, and currently maintains 1032701 as a fully owned subsidiary. A formal option agreement was entered into, effective March 31, 2016. An amendment to the agreement was entered into on the 14th of February 2018 whereby American Lithium will issue the 10,000 post consolidation “Agreement Year” shares to Lithium Corporation as mandated by the agreement, as well as a further 80,000 shares in consideration for Lithium Corporation agreeing to extend the work commitment date for Year 2 of the agreement to September 30, 2018. We had received all money, and common shares issuable in relation to the Fish Lake Valley option agreement, but the Purchaser did not satisfy the work commitment per the terms of the agreement, and issued formal notice of the relinquishment of the Purchasers right to earn the interest in the property on April 30th 2019. As this was the termination of the option agreement $443,308 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $159,859 allowance for the properties and has a net book value of $Nil.
San Emidio Property
The San Emidio property, located in Washoe County in northwestern Nevada, was acquired through the staking of claims in September 2011. The twenty, 80-acre, Association Placer claims currently held here cover an area of approximately 1,600 acres (640 hectares). Ten claims in the southern portions of the original claim block that was staked in 2011 were allowed to lapse on September 1, 2012, and a further ten claims were then staked and recorded. These new claims are north of and contiguous to the surviving claims from our earlier block. In 2015 eight claims were allowed to lapse, but then in 2016 a further 10 claims were staked and recorded. The property is approximately 65 miles north-northeast of Reno, Nevada, and has excellent infrastructure.
We identified this prospect during 2009, and 2010 through surficial geochemical sampling, and geological interpretation. The early reconnaissance sampling determined that anomalous values for lithium occur in sediments over a good portion of the playa. Our company conducted near-surface brine sampling in the spring of 2011, and a high resolution gravity geophysical survey in summer/fall 2011. Our company then permitted a 7 hole drilling program with the Bureau of Land Management in late fall 2011, and a direct push drill program was commenced in early February 2012. Drilling here delineated a narrow elongated shallow brine reservoir which is greater than 2.5 miles length, somewhat distal to the basinal feature outlined by the earlier gravity survey. The anomaly aligns with the present day topographical low in the valley, which could be the result of extension along a north-easterly trending fault. Two values of over 20 milligrams/liter lithium were obtained from two shallow direct push probe holes located centrally in this brine anomaly.

We drilled this prospect in late October 2012, further testing the area of the property in the vicinity where prior exploration by our company discovered elevated lithium levels in subsurface brines. During the 2012 program a total of 856 feet (260.89 meters) was drilled at 8 discrete sites. The deepest hole was 160 feet (48.76 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 90 feet (27.43 meters). The average depth of the seven hole program was 107 feet (32.61 meters). The program better defined the lithium-in-brine anomaly that was discovered in early 2012. This anomaly is approximately 0.6 miles (370 meters) wide at its widest point by more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) long. The peak value seen within the anomaly is 23.7 mg/l lithium, which is 10 to 20 times background levels outside the anomaly. Our company believes that, much like Fish Lake Valley, the playa at San Emidio may be conducive to the formation of a “Silver Peak” style lithium brine deposit, and the recent drilling indicates that the anomaly occurs at or near the intersection of several faults that may have provided the structural setting necessary for the formation of a lithium-in-brine deposit at depth.
Our company entered into an exploration earn-in agreement on the property on May 3, 2016 with 1067323 B.C. Ltd., wherein the Optionee was to pay an initial $100,000 and issue 100,000 shares within 30 days of a “Going Public Transaction”. 1067323 subsequently merged with American Lithium Corp., who then assumed the duties of the Optionee, and fulfilled the initial obligations. The further terms of the agreement are that American Lithium is to issue 100,000 shares to Lithium Corporation on or before both the first & second anniversaries of the going public transaction. Additionally American Lithium is to conduct $100,000 exploration work in year 1, $200,000 in year 2, and $300,000 in year 3. On fulfillment of all its obligations American Lithium will have earned an 80% interest in the property. The Optionee also has the option to earn a further 20% interest in the property by paying $1,000,000 to the company within 36 months of the exercise of the initial earn-in. If American Lithium exercises its right with respect to the subsequent earn-in then Lithium Corporation’s interest will revert to a 2.5% Net Smelter Revenue (NSR) interest. American Lithium then has the right at any time to purchase one half of the NSR (1.25%) for $1,000,000. Competing claims have been staked by third parties to the east and south of Lithium Corporation’s property here.
The Company has re-permitted and bonded three drill sites on the property, and is currently considering drilling the property some time in 2020.
BC Sugar Flake Graphite Property
On June 6, 2013, we entered into a mining claim sale agreement with Herb Hyder wherein Mr. Hyder agreed to sell to our company a 50.829 acre (20.57 hectare) claim located in the Cherryville area of British Columbia. As consideration for the purchase of the property, we issued 250,000 shares of our company’s common stock to Mr. Hyder. In addition to the acquired claim, our company staked or acquired another 13 claims at various times over the subsequent months, to bring the total area held under tenure to approximately 19,816 acres (8,020 hectares). Since that time the company has let all but what appears to be the most prospective claims lapse, and currently the company holds one title - the “Heavy Weather” claim that is 1422 acres (575.67 hectares) in size. The flake graphite mineralization of interest here is hosted predominately in graphitic quartz/biotite, and lesser graphitic calc-silicate gneisses. The rocks and mineralization in the general area of the BC Sugar prospect are similar to the host rocks in the area of the crystal graphite deposit 55 miles (90 kms) to the southeast that is being mined by Eagle Graphite.
The BC Sugar property is within the Shushwap Metamorphic Complex, in a geological environment favorable for the formation of flake graphite deposits, and is in an area of excellent logistics and infrastructure, with a considerable network of logging roads within the project area. Additionally the town of Lumby is approximately 19 miles (30 kms) to the south of the property, while the City of Vernon is only 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest of the western portions of the claim block.

Work progressed, and the property expanded throughout the summer of 2013, and culminated with the receipt of the final assays from the last phases of the prospecting and geological program in December of 2013. That work increased the area known to be underlain by graphitic bearing gneisses, and further evaluations were made in the area of the Sugar Lake, Weather Station, and Taylor Creek showings. In the general vicinity of the Weather Station showing that was initially discovered in early July 2013, a further 13 samples were taken, and hand trenching was performed at one of several outcrops in the area. In the trench a 5.2 meter interval returned an average of 3.14% graphitic carbon, all in an oxidized relatively friable gneissic host rock. Additionally a hydrothermal or vein type mineralized graphitic quartz boulder was discovered in the area which graded up to 4.19% graphitic carbon. The source of this boulder was not discovered during this program, but it is felt to be close to its point of origin. Samples representative of the mineralization encountered here were taken for petrographic study, which was received in late 2013. A brief assessment work program was performed in September 2014 to ensure all claims in the package were in good standing prior to the anticipated sale of this asset to Pathion Inc. Recommendations were made by the consulting geologist who wrote the assessment report with respect to trenching, and eventually drilling the Weather Station showing. Our company submitted a Notice of Work to the BC Government in early May 2015 to enable our company to conduct a program of excavator trenching, sampling and geological mapping on the Weather Station showing. In May of 2015 we signed an agreement with KLM Geosciences LLC of Las Vegas to conduct a short Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey on the property in the Weather Station - Taylor Creek areas. The GPR survey as well as a GEM-2 frequency domain electromagnetic (FDEM) survey took place in approximately mid-May 2015. The GPR survey did not provide useful data because of the moisture saturation in the shallow subsurface. The FDEM survey successfully generated an anomaly over known mineralization and possibly indicates that the mineralization may extend both to the west and to the east in areas blanketed by glaciofluvial till.
In August of 2015 our Notice of Work for trenching was approved by the BC Government and in October we commenced work. A trench of 265.76 feet (81 meters) was excavated and graphitic gneiss was mapped and sampled. In all 23 samples were taken over the 69 meters of exposed mineralization that could be safely sampled. Trench depths varied from 1.2 meters in areas of semi-consolidated rock to 4.8 meters in areas of mainly decomposed material. There was an approximately 12 meter section of the trench of sand, and fluvial till in an ancient stream bed where the excavator could not reach the graphitic material that is inferred to exist at depths greater than 5 meters. Also there was a 4 meter section at depths from 4.8 to 5 meters where graphite mineralization could be seen at depth, but could not be safely sampled.
The entire 69 meter interval that was sampled averaged 1.997% graphitic carbon, and mineralization remains open in all directions. Within that interval there was a 30 meter section that averaged 2.73% graphitic carbon, and within that interval there was a 12 meter section that averaged 2.99% graphitic carbon. The best mineralization, and most friable material is proximal to the aforementioned abandoned creek channel, and it appears that proximity to this feature gave rise to the deep weathering profile encountered here. Determining the tenor, and extent of the friable material were the two major objectives of this program as this material, which is very similar to that mined at Eagle Graphite’s operation is very easy/economical to be mined and processed, and typically contains the highest percentages of graphite over consistent widths.
A “min-bulk sample” was taken from the Weather Zone in October 2017, and submitted to SGS Vancouver for preliminary bench tests, and further petrographic analysis. Tests indicated that the “fairly coarse” flake graphite was easily liberated from the unconsolidated host material, and initial flotation tests were positive with over 80% of the graphite in the sample being floated off.
The Company revised its trenching permit in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62% graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company has reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 203 acres (82 hectares) to facilitate applying 5 years assessment credit to the property, and is effectively looking to place it on the “back burner” in favor of developing other prospects that are of greater commercial interest at this point.
The Hughes Claims
Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, LLC and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013. Through our 25% membership interest in Summa we hold an indirect interest in a number of patented mining claims that spring from the once considerable mineral holdings of Howard Hughes’s Summa Corp. Our company’s capital contribution paid to Summa, LLC was $125,000, of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services.
Tables of Contents
Lithium Corporation participated in the formation of Summa, which holds 88 fee-title patented lode claims that cover approximately 1,191.3 acres of prospective mineral lands. Our company signed a joint operating agreement with the other participants in Spring 2014 to govern the conduct of Summa, and the development of the lands. Our company’s director, Tom Lewis, was named as a managing member of Summa, and as such has a direct say in the day to day operations of that company.
The Hughes lands are situated in six discrete prospect areas in Nevada, the most notable of which being the Tonopah block in Nye County where Summa holds 56 claims that cover approximately 770 acres in the heart of the historic mining camp where over 1.8 million ounces of gold and 174 million ounces of silver were produced predominately in the early 1900’s. The Hughes claims include a number of the prolific past producers in Tonopah, such as the Belmont, the Desert Queen, and the Midway mines. In addition there are also claims in the area of the past producing Klondyke East mining district, which is to the south of Tonopah, and at the town of Belmont (not to be confused with the Belmont claim in Tonopah), Nevada, another notable silver producer from the 1800’s, which is roughly 40 miles to the northeast of Tonopah.
Summa has conducted preliminary research on the Hughes properties, focusing on the Tonopah area where reporting in the 1980’s, indicated that over 2.175 million tons of mine dumps and mill tailings exist at surface on Summa’s properties that contain in the order of 3.453 million ounces of silver, and 28,500 ounces of gold. In addition to this easily extractable surficial resource, other reports indicate that 300 - 500,000 tons of mineralized material is expected to remain at depth in old workings on Summa’s properties, which is believed to contain an average 20 ounces silver and 0.20 ounces gold per ton. Also several partially tested exploration targets have been identified on Summa’s Tonopah claims, where further work could potentially lead to a marked increase in known underground resources.
West Kirkland Mining has been working on the development of their 75% owned project in Tonopah, most recently drilling to increase the resource at the Three Hills gold/silver deposit where they intend to kick-off their mining efforts in the future. To that end they have bought an additional six patented mining claims here recently, and have also negotiated an agreement to procure rights for the water that they will need for processing. Presently the reserve at their Hasbrouck/Three Hills/Hill of Gold project stands at 45.3 million tons containing 762,000 ounces gold, and 10.6 million ounces Silver. Coeur Mines and partner Idaho North Resources drilled in the Klondyke area to the south of Tonopah (the same area where Summa holds several patented mining claims that arise from the Hughes acquisition), and have done some drilling recently in Tonopah on a prospect they have optioned adjacent and to the west of Summa’s holdings. In 2018 Coeur Mines also conducted drilling on Ely Gold’s claims to the west of Summa’s property on Patented claims that were once a portion of the Hughes holdings here. Although it has been reported that they intersected 5’ of 20 opt Ag, 0.3 opt Au, Coeur dropped their interest in this property. Recently Ely Gold entered into an agreement to purchase a further 75 patented claims adjacent to their Tonopah West prospect, and again announced on February 25, 2020 that they have signed a purchase/option agreement with Blackrock Gold Corp on the property. Under the terms of the agreement Blackrock is to pay $3,000,000 by April 01, 2020, and Ely will retain a 3% Nets Smelter Royalty on the property. Slightly further afield Gemfield Resources LLC., (a subsidiary of Waterton Global Resource Management) has recently completed the re-routing of Highway 95 south of Tonopah to facilitate the imminent mining of their 1.5 million ounce Au deposit near Goldfield Nevada.
The ongoing litigation with respect to Summa’s Tonopah holdings had precluded investing time or money into the property immediately after the court awarded Summa ownership in 2013, however in 2018 Summa won a “quiet title” case in the Fifth Judicial Court in Tonopah, which determined that Summas’ title is superior to all other claimants. The subsequent appeal of this verdict was quashed later in 2018, and there has been no further action on that account. Summa signed a Letter of Intent on January 14, 2020 with respect to the Tonopah property whereby 1237025 BC Ltd, can earn a 100% interest in the property (subject to a 1.0% Net Smelter Royalty or NSR) by paying $400,000 in cash, issuing $400,000 in shares, and incurring $1.5 million in exploration expenditures in stages over the next 5 years. The Optionee would also have the right to purchase ¼ of the NSR for $1,500,000, and the further right to purchase a further ¼ of the NSR for $2,500,000. Summa anticipates the signing of the definitive agreement by March 14, 2020.
British Columbia Tantalum/REE/Titanium Properties
On March 1st 2017 the company signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Bormal Resources Inc. wherein the company may earn an interest in three properties in British Columbia. The Michael property in the Trail Creek Mining Division was originally staked by Bormal to cover one of the most compelling tantalum (Ta) in stream sediment anomalies as seen in the government RGS database in British Columbia. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium (Nb) in stream sediment anomaly is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemical orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of niobium-tantalum in soils here.
Tables of Contents
Also in the general area of the Michael property the Yeehaw prospect has been staked by Bormal over a similar but lower amplitude Tantalum/Rare Earth Element (REE’s) stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated depicted on government geological maps as being within the Eocene Coryell batholith, and it is thought that these anomalies may arise from either carbonatite or pegmatite type deposits.
The third property at Three Valley Gap, is in the Revelstoke Mining Division and is situated in a locale where several Nb-Ta enriched carbonatites have been noted to occur. A brief field program by Bormal in 2015 located one of these carbonatites, and concurrent soil sampling determined that the soils here are enriched with Nb-Ta over the known carbonatite, and indicated that there are other geochemical anomalies locally that may indicate that more carbonatites exist here and are shallowly buried.
Lithium Corporation conducted fieldwork on the Michael, and Yeehaw properties during summer 2017. At Yeehaw a 30 meter wide structure was discovered that is anomalous for titanium and Rare Earth Elements, while soil sampling at Michael detected an anomaly that is greater than 800 meters in length that exhibits increased Tantalum-Niobium plus Rare Earth Element mineralization. The Company has dropped any further interest in both the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and has earned its 100% interest in the Yeehaw property. Field work on the Yeehaw property in Spring 2018 discovered a further zone of Ti/REE enrichment, and additional work was performed on the property in 2019 which extended the known strike of the Horseshoe Bend showing approximately 50 meters to the west, and mineralized float was found that possibly indicates it could continue to the east for another several hundred meters. The Company is currently assessing options for field season 2020 work here.
Our company is looking to ramp up its generative program exploring for new deposits of next generation battery related materials and are currently pursuing other properties which are believed to be prospective for hosting lithium, graphite or other “energy metals” as well as continuing to evaluate opportunities brought to our company by third parties.
