ITEM 2.PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2019, we owned interests in producing oil and natural gas properties in 530 fields in the Permian Basin, East Texas, Piceance Basin of Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and several other states, from 8,952 gross productive wells of which 2,770 are operated and 6,182 are non-operated. The following table sets forth information about our proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2019. The PV-10 amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. For a definition of “standardized measure,” please see the glossary of terms at the beginning of this annual report on Form 10-K.
__________________
(a)Reserves as of December 31, 2019 divided by annualized fourth quarter production volumes.
(b)PV-10 is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the standardized measure on a pre-tax basis. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas assets. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV-10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The below table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP standardized measure to PV-10 (non-GAAP) at December 31, 2019.
(c)As the Spraberry Field contains 24,212 MBoe, or 19.0% of total proved reserves of 127,223 MBoe, the following table presents the production, by product, for the Spraberry Field.

Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Our most significant fields and regions are Spraberry, East Texas, Lea and Piceance Basin. As of December 31, 2019, these four areas accounted for approximately 70% of our PV-10 and 78% of our total estimated proved reserves.
Spraberry Field. The Spraberry field is located in Andrews, Howard, Midland, Martin, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas. This Spraberry field summary includes wells in the War San field which produce from the same formations and in the same area as our Spraberry field wells. This field produces from Spraberry and Wolfcamp age formations from 5,000 to 11,000 feet. We operate 163 active wells (158 producing, 5 injecting) in this field with working interests ranging from 12.9% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 9.6% to 90.8%. We also own another 283 non-operated wells (279 producing, 4 injecting). As of December 31, 2019, our properties in the Spraberry field contained 24,212 MBoe (70.1% liquids) of net proved reserves with a PV-10 of $308.8 million. The average net daily production from this field was 8,952 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2019. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 7.4 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
11 wells were drilled on our properties in the Spraberry field in 2019. We have identified 13 more proved undeveloped projects, all of which are horizontal Wolfcamp or horizontal Spraberry locations. We have also identified numerous unproved drilling locations in this field.
Lea Field. The Lea field is located in Lea County, New Mexico. Our Lea field properties consist primarily of interests in the Lea Unit. The majority of the production from these properties is from the Bone Spring formation at depths of 9,500 feet to 11,500 feet. These properties also produce from the Morrow, Devonian, Delaware and Pennsylvania formations at depths ranging from 6,500 feet to 14,500 feet. We operate 54 wells (54 producing, 0 injecting) in the Lea field with working interests ranging from 28.0% to 93.2% and net revenue interests ranging from 29.2% to 78.0%. As of December 31, 2019, our properties in the Lea field contained 7,676 MBoe (71% liquids) of net proved reserves with a PV-10 of $111.1 million. The average net daily production from this field was 4,000 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2019. The estimated reserve life (R/P) of the field is 5.3 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
3 wells were drilled on our properties in the Lea field in 2019. Our engineers have identified two behind-pipe or proved developed non-producing recompletion projects in this field. We have also identified numerous unproved horizontal drilling locations in this field.
East Texas. Legacy's wells in the East Texas Basin are primarily located in Freestone, Leon and Robertson Counties, Texas. The wells in our East Texas fields are produced from multiple fields and formations which primarily include the Bossier and Cotton Valley formations at depths of approximately 12,000 to 14,000 feet. Legacy owns approximately 20,000 net undeveloped acres in the Shelby Trough and approximately 17,000 net undeveloped acres in the Freestone Cotton Valley. Legacy operates 879 active wells (874 producing, 5 injecting) in East Texas with working interests ranging from 20.0% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 3.2% to 100.0%. We also own another 529 non-operated wells (512 producing, 17 injecting). As of December 31, 2019, our properties in East Texas contained 36,713 MBoe of net proved reserves with a PV-10 of $92.4 million. The average net daily production from this field was 10,222 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2019. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 9.8 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
Piceance Basin. Legacy's wells in the Piceance Basin are located in Garfield County, Colorado in the Grand Valley, Parachute and Rulison fields. Most of the wells in these fields produce from the Williams Fork formation at depths of approximately 7,000 to 9,000 feet and some wells produce from the Wasatch formation at depths of 1,600 to 4,000 feet. Legacy's ownership in this basin is comprised of non-operated interests in 2,676 active wells acquired in 2014. As of December 31, 2019, our properties in the Piceance Basin contained 30,819 MBoe (18% liquids) of net proved reserves with a PV-10 of $50.2 million. The average net daily production from this field was 8,122 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2019. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 10.4 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth a summary of information related to our estimated net proved reserves as of the dates indicated based on reserve reports prepared by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. (“LaRoche”). The estimates of net proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency. Standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The following information represents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. These reserve estimates have been prepared in compliance with the SEC rules and accounting standards using current costs and the average annual prices based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As a result of this methodology, we used an average WTI posted price of $55.69 per Bbl for oil and an average Platts' Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.58 per MMBtu to calculate our estimate of proved reserves as of December 31, 2019. Please see the table below.
____________________
(a)PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the SEC (using current costs and the average annual prices based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general administrative expenses and debt service or to depletion, depreciation and amortization or future income taxes and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. For the purpose of calculating the PV-10, the costs and prices are unescalated. PV-10 does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Investing Activities.” Oil and natural gas prices as of each date are based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month as posted by Plains Marketing L.P. and Platts Gas Daily for oil and natural gas, respectively, with these representative prices adjusted by property to arrive at the appropriate net sales price, which is held constant over the economic life of the property.
(b) Oil and natural gas prices as of each date are based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month as posted by Plains Marketing L.P. and Platts Gas Daily for oil and natural gas, respectively, with these representative prices adjusted by property to arrive at the appropriate net sales price, which is held constant over the economic life of the property.
Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. PV-10 amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate PV-10, which is required by FASB pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
From time to time, we engage LaRoche to prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of properties that we are considering purchasing. Neither LaRoche nor any of its employees have any interest in those properties, and the compensation for these engagements is not contingent on their estimates of reserves and future net revenues for the subject properties.
Internal Control Over Reserve Estimations
Legacy's proved reserves are estimated at the well or unit level and compiled for reporting purposes by Legacy's reservoir engineering staff, none of whom are members of Legacy's operating teams nor are they managed by members of Legacy's operating teams. Legacy maintains internal evaluations of its reserves in a secure engineering database. Legacy's reservoir engineering staff meets with LaRoche periodically throughout the year to discuss assumptions and methods used in the reserve estimation process. Legacy provides LaRoche information on all properties acquired during the year for addition to Legacy’s reserve report. LaRoche updates production data from public sources and then modifies production forecasts for all properties as necessary. Legacy provides to LaRoche lease operating statement data at the property level from Legacy’s accounting system for estimation of each property’s operating expenses, price differentials, gas shrinkage and NGL yield. Legacy's reserve engineering staff provides all changes to Legacy’s ownership interests in the properties to LaRoche for input into the reserve report. Legacy provides information on all capital projects completed during the year as well as changes in the expected timing of future capital projects. Legacy provides updated capital project cost estimates and abandonment cost and salvage value estimates. Legacy's internal engineering staff coordinates with Legacy's accounting and other departments and works closely with LaRoche to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to LaRoche for its reserve estimation process. All of the reserve information in Legacy's secure reserve engineering data base is provided to LaRoche. After evaluating and inputting all information provided by Legacy, LaRoche, as independent third-party petroleum engineers, provides Legacy with a preliminary reserve report which Legacy's engineering staff and its Chief Financial Officer review for accuracy and completeness with an emphasis on ownership interest, capital spending and timing, expense estimates and production curves. After considering comments provided by Legacy, LaRoche completes and publishes the final reserve report. Legacy's engineering staff, in coordination with Legacy's accounting department and its Chief Financial Officer, ensure that the information derived from LaRoche's reports is properly disclosed in our filings.
Legacy’s Vice President - Corporate Reserves and Planning is the reservoir engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates by the third-party engineering firm, LaRoche. He has held a wide variety of technical and supervisory positions during a 24-year career with three publicly traded oil and natural gas producing companies, including Legacy. He has over 10 years of SEC & SPE reserve report preparation experience for domestic and international companies. For the professional qualifications of the primary person responsible for the third-party reserve evaluation, please see the last paragraph of Exhibit 99.1 - Summary Reserve Report from LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth a summary of unaudited information with respect to our production and sales of oil and natural gas for the period December 11 to December 31, 2019 (Successor), period January 1, to December 10, 2019 (Predecessor), and the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (Predecessor):
____________________
(a)Includes the production and operating results of the properties acquired as a part of our asset acquisition in conjunction with the Acceleration Payment from the closing date on August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2019 relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own an interest, and net wells are the product of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2019 relating to our leasehold acreage.
____________________
(a)Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells or wells capable of production.
(b)Undeveloped acres include acres held by production but not currently allocated or assigned to producing wells or wells capable of production and acres not held by production and subject to the primary term of the leases, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. The majority of our proved undeveloped locations are located on acreage currently held by production. As the economic viability of any potential oil and natural gas development related to the acres not held by production is remote, we have assigned minimal value to our acreage not held by production and thus the minimum remaining term of those leases is immaterial to us.
(c)A gross acre is an acre in which we own a working interest. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which we own a working interest.
(d)A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the product of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed by Legacy during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the numbers of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.
Summary of Development Projects
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $102.1 million in implementing our development strategy, including $69.3 million related to the drilling and completion of 29 gross (12.4 net) development wells. The remaining $32.8 million was comprised of the development of proved undeveloped reserves still in process, recompletions, fracture stimulation projects and various infrastructure capital. We estimate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2020 will be approximately $55.0 million for development drilling, recompletions and fracture stimulation and other development-related projects to implement this strategy. Over 90% of this capital is expected to be deployed in the Permian Basin. We will consider adjustments to this capital program based on our assessment of market conditions for oil and natural gas.
Present Activities
As of December 31, 2019, we were not in the process of drilling or completing any wells.
Operations
General
We operate approximately 66% of our total net daily production of oil and natural gas. Excluding our assets in the Piceance Basin, we operate approximately 87% of our net daily production of oil and natural gas. We design and manage the development, recompletion or workover for all of the wells we operate and supervise operation and maintenance activities. We do not own drilling rigs or any material oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties we operate. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ drilling, production and reservoir engineers, geologists and other specialists who have worked and will work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. We also employ field operating personnel including production superintendents, production foremen, production technicians and lease operators. We charge the non-operating partners an operating fee for operating the wells, typically on a fee per well-operated basis proportionate to each owner's working interest. Our non-operated wells are managed by third-party operators who are typically independent oil and natural gas companies.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. In our areas of operation, this amount generally ranges from 12.5% to 33.7%, resulting in an 87.5% to 66.3% net revenue interest to the working interest owners, including us. Most of our leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments.
Derivative Activity
We enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties with respect to oil and natural gas prices to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We have entered into derivative contracts in the form of fixed price swaps for NYMEX WTI oil, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas as well as Midland-to-Cushing crude oil, WAHA and CIG-Rockies basis differentials. All of these commodity contracts were executed in a costless manner, requiring no payment of premiums. Furthermore, none of our current derivative counterparties require us to post collateral. For a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities, please read “Business-Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Activities” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cash Flow from Operations.”
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title opinions have been obtained on a portion of our properties.
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense.
We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this document.
