Realty was formed in 1976. It has informed the Partnership that it now has approximately 20 employees and manages approximately 1,000,000 gross square feet of space.
As of December 31, 1998, there were approximately 50,000 square feet of office space available for rent in the Office Building. Retail and marketplace space was 89% occupied as of December 31, 1998 with approximately 1,500 square feet available for rent. See page II-7 for average occupancy percentages.
Parking Garage Management - -------------------------
Monument Parking Co., Inc. (Monument) entered into a garage lease with BMCLP, dated March 14, 1983, pursuant to which BMCLP leased to Monument the underground parking garage from the date that it opened. Under the garage lease, Monument pays rent to BMCLP in an amount equal to the gross receipts of the parking garage less all operating expenses thereof, including an annual management fee to Monument in the amount of $65,000, until adjusted gross receipts (defined as all cash, revenue and compensation received from garage operations, reduced by parking taxes and other operating expenses) equal $1,500,000.
Monument retains 10% of all adjusted gross receipts in excess of $1,500,000 until the adjusted gross receipts reach $2,000,000, as an incentive fee. In addition, Monument retains 30% of all adjusted gross receipts in excess of $2,000,000, as a further incentive fee. In 1998, 1997 and 1996, adjusted gross receipts equaled $1,092,041, $1,126,162 and $1,154,985, respectively, and thus no incentive fee was due for any of these years.
The garage lease requires Monument to provide parking privileges to tenants of the Office Building, their guests and employees and the guests and employees of the Hotel on a priority basis.

BMCLP FINANCING ---------------
Original Mortgage Debt - ----------------------
On December 23, 1985, BMCLP entered into a ten-year, nonrecourse mortgage note (the First Mortgage Note) with Great Western Bank (Great Western) in the amount of $120,000,000. The First Mortgage Note provided for a variable interest rate, adjustable monthly, of 2.75% in excess of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Eleventh District weighted-average cost of funds.
On July 1, 1987, BMCLP entered into a five-year nonrecourse mortgage note (the Second Mortgage Note) with Great Western for $10,000,000 together with a modification of the First Mortgage Note. Principal and accrued interest were due at maturity. The proceeds of this loan were used to fund operating deficit requirements. The Second Mortgage Note also provided for a variable interest rate, adjustable monthly, of 4% in excess of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Eleventh District weighted-average cost of funds.
On September 17, 1985, BMCLP entered into a nonrecourse mortgage note (the Third Mortgage Note) in the amount of $3,000,000 with Iroquois Financial Corporation (Iroquois), an affiliate of the Special Limited Partners of BMCLP, with interest at a rate of 9.0%. Payments of principal and interest were contingent upon available net cash flow as defined in the agreement.
On October 12, 1990, BMCLP was notified by Great Western that an event of default had occurred related to the nonpayment of its debt service obligation under the First and Second Mortgage Notes (collectively, the Notes). Effective June 15, 1992, Great Western and BMCLP entered into a modification which superseded all previous modifications and was in effect until the restructuring on November 16, 1994, as discussed below.
The modification provided for interest to be accrued at the stated rate, adjusted as set forth in the original Notes, and for interest payments in an amount equal to all of BMCLP's net cash flow, as defined, to be due and payable monthly. All accrued but unpaid interest was added to principal and was to be due in full at maturity. No regular principal payments were required.
The modification also provided for quarterly payments (Excess Payments) to be paid to Great Western beginning March 1992. However, BMCLP paid all net cash flow to Great Western, and, therefore, did not itself have cash to make the Excess Payments. These Excess Payments were partially funded to Great Western from management fees waived by Hyatt and those deferred by Realty and Capitol Hotel Group (CHG), an affiliate of the General Partners. During 1994, BMCLP was advanced a total of $193,916, including accrued interest, from CRI for the payment of the Excess Payments due. BMCLP paid $796,876 of Excess Payments to Great Western in 1994, as required. Under the restructured debt, which occurred November 16, 1994, as discussed below, no further Excess Payments were required.
Restructuring of Original Mortgage Debt - ---------------------------------------
On November 16, 1994, Great Western sold the Notes to BMC Lender Partnership (BMC), an unaffiliated entity which amended and restated the First and Second Mortgage Notes. BMC amended and restated the First Mortgage Note

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
(the Restated First Mortgage Note) to a principal amount of $48,000,000 and sold the Restated First Mortgage Note to General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC). BMC amended and restated the Second Mortgage Note (the Restated Second Mortgage Note) (collectively, the Restated Notes) to a principal amount of $10,000,000 advanced at closing. Of the total $58 million principal amount of the Restated Notes, $55 million was paid to Great Western in consideration for the Notes, approximately $1.8 million was used to fund loan fees and related costs on behalf of BMCLP, approximately $200,000 was used to fund interest and insurance premiums at the closing date, and the remaining amount of approximately $1.0 million was deposited into an escrow account restricted for working capital requirements.
The Restated First Mortgage Note requires monthly interest payments in arrears, payable at 4.25% in excess of the GECC Composite Commercial Rate which, at December 31, 1998 and 1997 was 5.27% and 5.79%, respectively. In addition to monthly interest payments, monthly principal payments are due in the amount of $108,333. Furthermore, if certain major tenants of the Office Building, as defined in the Restated First Mortgage Note agreement, do not exercise an option to renew, or if they cancel their leases, additional principal payments equal to 100% of net cash flow, as defined, must be remitted to GECC. These payments must continue until the space vacated is 93% rented and other minimum financial conditions are met. One of the major tenants of the Office Building cancelled its lease at the end of 1998 and moved out of its space at the end of February 1999. No additional principal payments have been paid or requested to be paid by GECC and therefore have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements. All unpaid principal is due at the maturity date, which is November 30, 2001. Additional advances may be made by GECC in an aggregate amount not to exceed 50% of all previously made principal payments. Any additional advances are generally intended to fund tenant improvements, leasing costs and other capital improvements, but may be used to fund other cash flow needs as well. For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, GECC advanced $222,434, $535,899 and $975,001, respectively, to BMCLP for capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs. Interest accrued on cumulative advances is included in interest expense, and is also added to the balance of the Restated First Mortgage Note.

Additionally, under the terms of the Restated First Mortgage Note, an interest reserve account to be used as additional collateral under the Restated First Mortgage Note was established. Monthly payments of $23,125 were made into this reserve beginning January 1, 1995 through December 1, 1998, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the interest reserve balance was $1,135,046 and $832,500, respectively.
The Restated Second Mortgage Note stipulates that 16% interest is payable monthly from available cash flow, as defined, on a cumulative basis. Based on the provisions of the Restated Second Mortgage Note, BMCLP s cash flow from operations shall be disbursed in priority, as follows.
(1) Debt service and reserves on the Restated First Mortgage Note.
(2) Establishment of working capital reserves of $50,000 plus an amount reasonably required to pay ordinary and necessary expenses of operations.
(3) Debt service on the Restated Second Mortgage Note (to the extent of available cash flow).
(4) Principal and interest on additional advances, as discussed below, if any, made to BMCLP by BMC.
(5) 75% of the remaining net cash flow (as defined) to BMC and 25% of the remaining net cash flow to BMCLP (less up to $50,000 per year to cover management and administrative costs of the Partnership and/or CRCC), subject to the establishment of the reserves as stipulated in the agreement, as discussed below.
Furthermore, BMC is entitled to an Economic Value Participation Interest, as defined, which requires BMCLP to pay the following at the sale of the property, or refinancing or maturity of the Restated Notes.
(1) 75% of the amount by which the Economic Value of the Development, as defined, up to $100 million, exceeds the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest under the Restated Notes, and
(2) 50% of the Economic Value in excess of $100 million.

PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
In general, the Economic Value is defined by the Restated Second Mortgage Note as the value of the Development as determined by the Partnership or the average of three independent appraisals, if deemed necessary by BMC. Historically, the Partnership has not received appraisals of the Development in order to determine the Economic Value. However, in the opinion of the Managing General Partner, based on its knowledge of the Development and the real estate market, the Economic Value Participation Interest due to BMC as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, is not in excess of the deferred gain recorded by the Partnership as of each of those dates.
In 1998, 1997 and 1996, $150,000 was paid each year to BMC as 75% of remaining net cash flow for 1997, 1996 and 1995. Also in 1998, 1997 and 1996, $50,000 was paid each year to CRCC as BMCLP management fees for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively; such amounts are included in management fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, $150,000 and $50,000 were accrued for net cash flow participation and management fees, respectively, as of both December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 for fiscal years 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Restated Second Mortgage Note is due on November 30, 2001 and no principal payments are required until then. However, any amounts remitted to BMC with respect to its 75% net cash flow participation described above may be re-advanced to BMCLP for payment of debt service on the Restated First Mortgage Note, repairs, capital improvements, leasing commissions, tenant concessions and improvements, taxes and ground lease payments. These advances are limited to 75% of the total amount required to fund these items. The remaining 25% must be funded by BMCLP. BMC has reserved the right, but does not have the obligation, to make up to $5 million in additional advances that would be secured under its Restated Second Mortgage Note. These additional advances would carry an interest rate of 18% payable from available net cash flow, as defined, and would also be due on November 30, 2001. As of December 31, 1998, no additional advances have been made.
BMC required that BMCLP deposit a deed in lieu of foreclosure in escrow to be recordable in the event of a default under the Restated Second Mortgage Note. CRCC agreed to amend and restate various "no bankruptcy" agreements of the type the original lender, Great Western, had required of it and certain affiliates. The new agreements are not secured or guaranteed, but a default thereunder could trigger the recordation of the escrowed deed in lieu of foreclosure. An event of default would occur if an entity other than CRCC became a General Partner of BMCLP (and could potentially put BMCLP in bankruptcy).
Additionally, under the terms of the Restated Second Mortgage Note, the Partnership received working capital reserves as proceeds in connection with the November 16, 1994 debt restructuring. These funds are held by BMC in an escrow account and can be used by BMCLP to fund any operating expenses by demonstrating the need for such funds to BMC. As of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, the balance in the escrow account was $319,294 and $273,654, respectively. There were no withdrawals from or deposits to the reserve by BMCLP during 1998 or 1997.

A purchase money mortgage had been placed upon the Development as of September 17, 1985 to secure payment for the $3,000,000 purchase by BMCLP of the partnership interest in BMCLP held by Iroquois Financial Corporation (Iroquois), a Maryland corporation, which, the Partnership has been advised, is owned 50% by Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky and 50% by an individual unaffiliated with Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky or the General Partners. The purchase money note (the Third Mortgage Note) was subordinated to the Second Mortgage Note as of July, 1987. The Third Mortgage Note bears simple interest at 9%. In connection with the debt restructuring on November 16, 1994, the Third Mortgage Note was amended to provide that interest is due and payable annually only to the extent funds are available after taking into account payment of amounts due and payable on the Restated Notes and a payment of up to $50,000 per year to CRCC and/or the Partnership to cover costs of management and administration. Accrued but unpaid interest is to be deferred without interest and is to be paid, together with the outstanding principal balance of the Third Mortgage Note, upon the earliest of: (i) sale of the assets of BMCLP; (ii) refinancing of the Restated Notes for an amount in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal balances due thereunder; or (iii) one day later than the later of any Maturity Date under the Restated Notes. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, accrued interest of $3,589,500 and $3,319,500, respectively, has been added to the outstanding principal balance of $3,000,000 in accordance with the amended Third Mortgage Note. No net cash flow, as defined in the agreement, was available for repayment of this note during 1998, 1997 or 1996.
Substantially all of BMCLP's property and equipment is pledged as collateral to the Restated First and Second Mortgage Notes and to the Third Mortgage Note.
Debt Forgiveness - ----------------
BMCLP's outstanding obligation under the Restated Notes prior to the restructuring was $197,754,727. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings" ("SFAS 15"), the net carrying amount of the outstanding principal and accrued interest prior to the restructuring in excess of the total estimated future cash payments for principal and interest (based on the interest rate in effect on the date of restructuring for the Restated First Mortgage Note) of the Restated Notes was recorded as a deferred gain on debt restructuring in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under SFAS 15, a debtor should not recognize a gain on restructuring involving indeterminate future cash payments (the floating rate interest on the Restated First Mortgage Note and the Economic Value Participation Interest on the Restated Second Mortgage Note) as long as the maximum total future cash payments may exceed the carrying amount of the debt. For purposes of applying SFAS 15, the Restated Notes have been aggregated, as the restructuring was negotiated between BMCLP and a single lender.
Based on the Restated First Mortgage Note's interest rate of 9.52% and 10.04% in effect at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and the monthly principal curtailments of $108,333 as stipulated in the Restated First Mortgage Note, the estimated total future obligation for principal and interest is $56,666,258 and $62,774,907 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, including additional draws subsequent to the restructuring. As a result of the fluctuations of the interest rate on the Restated First Mortgage Note, the Partnership continues to remeasure the estimated total future obligation for principal and interest based upon changes in the underlying index. Differences
I-11

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
in the total estimated future obligation resulting from interest rate changes are reflected as a reclassification between the Restated First Mortgage Note and deferred gain on debt restructuring. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1996, $651,018 and $990,767, respectively, were reclassified from the Restated First Mortgage Note to the deferred gain on debt restructuring. For the year ended December 31, 1997, $551,054 was reclassified from the deferred gain on debt restructuring to the Restated First Mortgage Note.
With regard to the Restated Second Mortgage Note, the total estimated future obligation for payment of principal and interest at the time of the restructuring, based on the fixed interest rate of 16%, was $21,200,000. This amount exceeded the carrying amount of the Second Mortgage Note prior to restructuring of $19,380,974. As noted above, the Restated Notes have been aggregated for accounting purposes. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS 15, this difference of $1,819,026, which represents a constant additional interest obligation based on the fixed interest rate, is being accrued for and added to the Restated Second Mortgage Note principal balance over the term of the Restated Second Mortgage Note as a reclassification from the deferred gain on debt restructuring. For each of the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, $259,860 was reclassified from the deferred gain on debt restructuring to the Restated Second Mortgage Note.
Due to the variable interest rate on the Restated First Mortgage Note and BMCLP's potential liability to BMC as a result of the Economic Value Participation Interest, the total future obligations under the Restated Notes, including future interest and contingent payments, cannot currently be determined. Therefore, the deferred gain on debt restructuring will not be recognized as an extraordinary gain unless it is realized through repayment or refinancing of the Restated Notes. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the deferred gain on debt restructuring was $98,998,507 and $98,607,349, respectively.
OPERATING DEFICIT OBLIGATION ----------------------------
For operating deficits which arise, the BMCLP Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) provides that Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky and their affiliates (collectively, R&K) are required to loan, or cause to be loaned, all amounts necessary to pay operating deficits (Operating Deficit Loans) up to an aggregate principal amount of $15,600,000. R&K and the Partnership have agreed that the former Second Mortgage Note of $10,000,000 was an Operating Deficit Loan "caused to be" made to BMCLP by R&K. Further, R&K's Operating Deficit Loan obligation limit of $15,600,000 was increased by (1) an amount equal to the net positive difference between the interest due and payable under the original terms of the First Mortgage Note and the interest due and payable under the original First Mortgage Note as a result of the third loan modification and (2) the amount that interest accruing on the original Second Mortgage Note exceeded the interest that would have accrued had the loan been made directly by R&K. At December 31, 1998, BMCLP estimates that R&K's total operating deficit obligation has increased to approximately $29,000,000, although R&K do not concur with this amount. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, R&K have provided $2,599,769 and $2,490,352, respectively, including accrued interest, to BMCLP to fund operating deficits under this provision of the LPA. Interest on amounts advanced to BMCLP for operating deficits is accrued at the prime rate plus 1% and will be repaid subject to the terms of the Restated Notes and then out of 50% of cash flow available after payment of certain priorities as set forth in the BMCLP

partnership agreement. These Operating Deficit Loans shall be repaid in full upon the earlier to occur of (1) fifteen years from the date of such loans or (2) liquidation, sale or refinancing of the Development (except a refinancing which does not exceed the outstanding principal balance of the original First Mortgage Note).
The obligation of R&K to make or cause to be made Operating Deficit Loan(s) is jointly and severally guaranteed by Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky and further secured by the expense allowance payable to Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky, the incentive management fee payable to Rozansky & Kay Construction Company (R&KCC), one-half (1/2) of the disposition fee payable to Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky from the proceeds of any sale of the Development, and any distributions made to Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky from the net cash flow of BMCLP or from the proceeds of any sale or refinancing of BMCLP. All obligations of R&KCC have been assumed by Alan I. Kay and Allan E. Rozansky.
