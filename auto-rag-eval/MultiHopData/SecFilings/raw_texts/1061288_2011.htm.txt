The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Company’s overriding royalties total 387,721 net royalty acres under 10,610,564 gross surface acres in 11 concessions located in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins. In addition the Company also owns 623 net royalty acres under 155,676 gross acres in a concession located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership and acreage for each concession.
The Eromanga Basin encompasses the southwestern portion of the state of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australia’s main onshore producing oil and gas basin.
The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Company’s overrides are in a prime location since the majority of the Company’s interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
The Company has Overriding Royalty Interests in VIC/P54 Permits in the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the states of Victoria and Tasmania which have had in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964.
On the 10,766,240 gross surface acres where ACOR holds Overriding Royalty Interests, there are large anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic structures, all of which indicate possibilities for oil and gas reserves. In addition, about $27 million worth of seismic information has been completed and is available on the areas.
During 2011 the Company received revenues from six of its Overriding Royalty Interests known as ATP 267, ATP 299, ATP 560, PEL 111, PEL 115 and VIC/P54. For further information see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”.
In addition to the Company’s large overriding royalty position it also has Working Interests in four concessions, which are all located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin. See the table for Working Interest Holdings for additional information.

The following is a summary of the Company’s Australian properties divided into three areas: 1) Gippsland Basin - Victoria, 2) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia, and 3) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland:
Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin
The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in VIC/P54, a producing oil and gas concession, located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964. The following is a report on the Company’s interests in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin:
A review of the Longtom discoveries is important to see the magnitude of these wells. The Longtom-3 was drilled and completed during the summer of 2006. Two production tests were conducted on the well:
The first test produced gas from the 400 sand at 23MMscf/d. The results from this test confirm the flow potential of the 400 sand reservoir in the Longtom field, addressing a major concern leading up to the drilling of the Longtom-3 well. A flow was not achieved in the second test of Longtom-2 (conducted over the 400 sand). Nexus Energy Pty. Ltd. has interpreted this test as having failed due to down-hole mechanical problems.
The second test, over the 100, 200 and 300 sand intervals in the horizontal hole section exceeded expectations producing an estimated 77MMcf/d when bypassing the test separator and 59MMcf/d when flowing through the test separator (the separator’s flow capacity). Sampling during the test recorded expected levels of carbon dioxide (less than 1%) and less than one part per million hydrogen sulphide.
In addition, the second test indicated that the condensate yield is higher in the 100 sands than in the sands above it, which is expected to provide an economic boost to the project.
The Longtom-4 development well was drilled during the summer of 2008. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.
A 12” pipeline was constructed to the Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009. Revenues from gas sales for the Company began in 2010. During 2010 the Longtom Field was shut in due to mercury levels exceeding gas plant standards. A processing plant was installed to remove the excess mercury and production from the Longtom Field resumed in November 2010.
The Company’s net revenues from the Longtom Field for 2011 were $44,129.51 representing approximately 35% of the total revenues reported for the year. The operator of VIC/P54 is evaluating the Gemfish prospect for their next target as it is in a separate reservoir and structural setting. No drilling dates have been announced as of the date of this report.
Cooper/Eromanga Basin - South Australia
The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in five oil and gas concessions and holds Working Interests in three oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia. The following is a brief summary report on each of the Company’s interests in South Australia:
PEL 88
ACOR owns a 3/10ths of 1% Overriding Royalty Interest under PEL 88, which covers 816,436 gross acres. Three prospects have been identified on PEL 88, Acacia, Casuarina and Lancier. The potential recoverable reserves of each of these prospects are 15,000,000 barrels of oil in the Acacia, 18,000,000 barrels of oil in the Casuarina and 48,000,000 barrels of oil in the Lancier. No assurance can be made that these prospects will be drilled.
PEL 100
ACOR holds a 1% Working Interest in the Cleansweep #1, which was drilled in the 2008 fiscal year and was completed as a Birkhead formation producer. The well tested 444 barrels of oil on a drill stem test. The Cleansweep well is estimated to have the potential of 4.8 million barrels of recoverable oil in place. Recent seismic mapping has confirmed that Angelica #1 drilled in 1998 was drilled off structure. A more detailed review of the existing seismic identified a four-way drape structure of Eromanga Basin sediments over a basement horst bald of Permian strata. A detailed 3D seismic program is planned to ensure that Angelica #2 tests the crest of this structure; however, this program has been delayed due to flooding in the area. The Angelica 3D seismic survey is proposed to cover 302 square kilometers and was planned for the fourth quarter of 2011, however it was delayed and as of the date of this report has not been rescheduled.
PEL 111
ACOR owns a 1/10th of 1% Overriding Royalty Interest under PEL 111, which covers 290,101 gross acres. Mapping of PEL 111 seismic data coupled with the reprocessing of existing seismic data identified 20 leads and prospects for potential oil and gas in the Birkhead, Hutton, Tirrawarra and Patchawarra formations. The Warhawk #1 was drilled in 2008 and was cased and suspended as a future producer. During 2009 three wells (Snatcher 1, 2 & 3) were drilled and completed as producers in the Birkhead channel sands. The Snatcher #1 well tested 218 barrels of oil per day.
The Snatcher #1 began producing on December 20, 2009 with both the Snatcher wells 2 & 3 coming on line during the first quarter of 2010; however, they were shut in due to flooding and continued to remain shut in through 2011. The severe flooding caused major road and access problems. The operator anticipates returning the field to production in April 2012.
Plans to drill Liberator #1 during the summer of 2010, which is located approximately 700 meters northwest of Snatcher #3, has been delayed due to flooding in the area. As of the date of this report no announcement has been made as to a drilling date for the Liberator #1.The operator reports another prospect is on their 2012 plans for drilling, known as the Angelica #2.
Santos has commenced construction of the Charo-Tirrawarra pipeline, which is to facilitate the transportation of crude oil from the Charo and Snatcher Fields. The pipeline is scheduled for commissioning in April 2012.
PEL 112 & 444
Holloman Energy Corp. (“Holloman”), the operator of PEL 112 & PEL 444, has identified 38 leads on PEL 112. The Company owns a 13.83% Working Interest under both PEL 112 & PEL 444 and is 100% fully carried for its 13.83% Working Interest in the next two wells drilled on either PEL. The Company will be obligated to pay its proportionate part on any exploration costs thereafter. PEL 112 and PEL 444 comprise approximately 1.125 million gross acres and are both located within Australia’s most prolific onshore oil and gas-producing basin, the Cooper/Eromanga Basin.
Subsequent to December 31, 2012 Holloman was granted a variation on its license conditions on PEL 112. Under the terms of the variation, the date by which Holloman is obligated to acquire 100 kilometers of 2D seismic on PEL was moved to January 10, 2013. Holloman also reports in their February 27, 2012 Press Release that it has recently received a series of offers relating to one or both of its Cooper Basin licenses. Holloman is reviewing those proposals as of the date of this report. ACOR’s Carried Working Interest in both PEL 112 and 444 will be adjusted in a joint effort with Holloman to attract a joint venture partner to conduct seismic and drill multiple wells.
During 2011, Beach Energy Limited discovered three new oil pools on PEL 92, a license, which abuts the northwestern most corner, the PEL 112. One of those discoveries, the Germein-1 oil discovery, is less than 7 miles from PEL 112. Although no formal reserve estimates or production data are yet available on these discoveries, Beach Energy Limited reports that the PEL 92 Parsons-4 well, which tested at 7,600 barrels of oil per day, is now online. ACOR does not own an interest in PEL 92, however the information on PEL 92 is important, as it is relevant to ACOR’s Working Interest in PEL 112.
In October 2011, Senex Energy Limited (“Senex”) initiated an eleven well drilling program on Petroleum Retention License ("PRL") 15 and PEL 104, both of which lie directly southwest of PEL 444. PRL 15 contains the prolific Growler oil field, which is expected to produce approximately 700,000 barrels of oil during Senex's current fiscal year. Senex reports completion of seven of the eleven wells. Five of the Senex wells were successfully completed and suspended for future production. The Growler-6 well tested for production at 1,374 barrels of oil per day. One of the two economically unsuccessful exploration wells (Spitfire-1) resulted in the discovery of a new oil field on PEL 104. ACOR does not own an interest in PEL 104 or PRL 15, however the information on PEL 104 is important, as it is relevant to ACOR’s Working Interest in PEL 444.
PEL 115
This permit covers 65,730 gross acres under which ACOR holds an Overriding Royalty Interest of 10% of 1% of Gross Production. PEL 115 is located in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. The Mirage-1 well completed in July 2005 initially flowed clean oil at a rate of 372 barrels of oil per day on a ½ inch choke. Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet.
The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately 20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the northeast. Such an area has the potential of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir.
In the southern part of PEL 115 the interpretation of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra and Thunderbolt). During 2009 the Fury #1 and Airacobra #1 were drilled and completed as producers. Based on the analysis of the wire line log data and sidewall cores and similarity of the Murta oil column in Fury-1 to those seen in the producing Mirage Oil Field, 5 kilometers to the southwest, Fury-1 has been completed for production with 7 inch production casing run to 6,446 feet. Production from Fury-1 was delayed due to flooding and damages incurred to the roads and area during 2011. As of the date of this report no announcements have been received as to when production will begin.
Subsequent to December 31, 2012 a group announced it had reached an agreement with Orca Energy Limited, operator of PEL 115, to farm-in to PEL 115. Under the terms of the agreement, the group has the right to earn a further 22% in PEL 115 by committing to fund Orca’s remaining 20% share of the cost of an unconventional gas well on the permit. Under this agreement the group’s ownership will increase to 55% working interest.
PEL 424
Formerly known as PEL’s 86, 87 & 89, these PEL’s were grouped together for a new Petroleum Exploration License know as PEL 424 covering 1,516,733 acres under which the Company holds a 10% of 1% of 8/8ths Overriding Royalty Interest represented by a total of 12,134 net royalty acres. The operator of PEL 424 was Victoria Petroleum N.L. which became Senex Energy Limited during 2011. PEL 424 is located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. As of the date of this report no information was available as to the plans for this area.
Cooper/Eromanga Basin - Queensland
The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in seven oil and gas concessions and holds Working Interests in one oil and gas concession located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland. The following is a report on each of the Company’s interests in Queensland:
ATP 267
The Company owns an Overriding Royalty Interest of 17.15% of 1% in ATP 267, which covers approximately 220,800 acres. ATP 267 has 25 Producing Wells in six oil fields known as the Kihee, Koora, Nockatunga, Winna, Maxwell, Dikera, Thungo and Murhero fields. The Company received revenues from its Overriding Royalty Interest in these wells during 2011. No new wells were drilled during 2011 on this concession.
ATP 299
The Company owns a .0575% of 1% Overriding Royalty Interest under ATP-299 and its Petroleum Licenses which covers 441,600 gross acres and currently has 104 completed wells under which ACOR receives overriding royalties. The Tintaburra Block is reported to contain approximately 84 million barrels of proved plus probable oil in place. ATP 299 has 104 Producing Wells in 25 oil fields. The Company received revenues of from its Overriding Royalty Interest in these wells during 2011. No new wells were drilled during 2011 on this concession.
ATP 560
ATP 560 covers 625,600 acres under which the Company holds a 25% of 1% override. The Utopia Oil Field is situated in ATP 560P in the Eromanga Basin in southwest Queensland, approximately 150 km north east of the Jackson Oilfield and 50 km south of the Kenmore Oilfield. The Utopia field is a broad low-relief structure, with a maximum relief of approximately 10 m. The field produces from the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation and is the largest known Murta pool in the Queensland Eromanga Basin. The oil pool is at an approximate depth of 1020 m. The most recent technical review of Utopia undertaken in June 2004 determined the field could contain up to 2.86 million barrels of recoverable oil.
During 2011 the Utopia-11H, a horizontal development well, was drilled and completed as a Murta oil producer after a 176.5 meter horizontal drain hole was successfully drilled. The operator reports excellent oil shows in a very good quality reservoir sand continued to be encountered while drilling the horizontal leg. The Utopia-11H well was put into production during the third quarter of 2011.
ATP 582
ATP-582 is located in Queensland Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. The permit area covers approximately 5,308,764 gross acres. ATP 582 lies within the Georgina Basin, which covers most of the central-eastern part of the Northern Territory and is considered one of the most prospective undeveloped onshore petroleum provinces in Northern Territory and Queensland. Although the Georgina Basin has not had a discovery today, the Company believes the Cambrian Thorntonia-Arthur Creek succession of the Georgina Basin possess all of the required elements necessary for petroleum generation, migration and entrapment. Of particular interest in the Georgina Basin and on ATP 582 is the presence of the Arthur Creek Shale, which has similar characteristics to the Bakken Shale of Western Canada and North Dakota that has produced more than 10 TCF of gas and 1 Billion barrels of oil.
More improvement in multi high-pressure fracing technology over the past 10 years has made low permeable shale very economic to produce both oil and gas and has been widely used in North America to unlock unconventional reservoirs in shale bearing hydrocarbons. This technology has not been utilized in the Georgina Basin; however, on the adjoining concession to the east in the Northern Territory plans are to drill two horizontal wells into the Arthur Creek Shale utilizing the current high pressure multiple stage fracing on this formation. ATP 582 is well positioned with a large portion of its 5,308,764 acres known to have the presence of the Arthur Creek Shale in place.
On the adjoining concession to the west of ATP 582 two horizontal wells drilled into the Arthur Creek Shale. The first well drilled was the Baldwin-2H well followed by the MacIntyre-2H well located approximately 60 kilometers northeast of the Baldwin-2H well. PetroFrontier Corp. delayed completion of these two wells due to the upcoming wet season and plans to complete both of these wells with a multiple staged frac program. As of the date of this report no definitive plans have been announced as to the timing for the completion of these two wells.
In addition to the Arthur Shale opportunity, ACOR management has identified two prospects on ATP-582 from the 850 miles of seismic data, owned by ACOR. ATP 582 is up dip of the approximately $1 billion dollar annual production from the Santos-Exxon producing block and is along strike with many new discovery wells that have sustained daily production of 1,000 - 3,000 barrels of oil per day. The two prospects that have been identified are:
The Samphire Prospect covers approximately 3,800 acres and exhibits approximately 110 feet of closure. It is possible that a good potential exists for a 10-15 million barrel field, with a possible potential of approximately 40 million barrels.
The Samphire West Prospect covers around 4,700 acres. If the Samphire prospect proves to be productive, a number of additional field discoveries may result from leads in the Southern part of ATP-582. Both prospects are a series of sandstone (clastic) reservoirs of pinch-outs and structural traps that have formed on the flank of the local high.
On September 26th, 2006 (subsequently replaced by an agreement dated on or about February 23, 2012) the Company entered into an agreement where the partner will pay to obtain Native Title clearance, pay all expenses in connection with applying for Environmental Authority, shoot a new seismic grid survey over the leads identified by ACOR management from old seismic data to confirm good drillable targets with plans to drill a well to earn a 50% Working Interest under ATP 582 (ACOR will be carried for 50% Working Interest). During the fourth quarter of 2011 native title was cleared on ATP 582. A request was filed during the fourth quarter of 2011 to renew ATP 582 for a new exploration term. As of the date of this report ATP 582 had not been renewed, however it is reported the renewal is expected to occur in April 2012.
For information on Working Interests acquired by the Company and located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland, Australia see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
