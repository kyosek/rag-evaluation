ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES--Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships."
Management of the Company
Although the Board of Directors is directly responsible for managing the affairs of ART and for setting the policies which guide it, the day-to-day operations of ART are performed by Basic Capital Management, Inc. ("BCM"), a contractual advisor under the supervision of the Board. The duties of BCM include, among other
things, locating, investigating, evaluating and recommending real estate and mortgage note investment and sales opportunities, as well as financing and refinancing sources. BCM also serves as a consultant in connection with ART's business plan and investment policy decisions made by its Board. BCM is a company owned by a trust for the benefit of the children of Gene E. Phillips. Mr. Phillips serves as a representative of the trust for the benefit of his children that owns BCM and, in such capacity, has substantial contact with the management of BCM and input with respect to BCM's performance of advisory services. As of March 3, 2000, BCM owned 6,008,867 shares of ART's Common Stock, approximately 56.9% of the shares then outstanding. BCM is more fully described in ITEM 10. "DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ADVISOR OF THE REGISTRANT--The Advisor." BCM has been providing advisory services to ART since February 6, 1989. BCM also serves as advisor to IORI and TCI. The officers of ART, are also officers of IORI, TCI, BCM and NMC, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP. Karl L. Blaha, President and a Director of ART, serves as President and a Director of NMC and also serves as President of IORI, TCI and BCM. Collene C. Currie, a Director of ART also serves as a Director of NMC. BCM performs certain administrative functions for NRLP and NOLP on a cost reimbursement basis.
Since February 1, 1990, affiliates of BCM have provided property management services to ART. Currently, Triad Realty Services, Ltd. ("Triad") provides such property management services. Triad subcontracts with other entities for the property-level management services to ART. The general partner of Triad is BCM. The limited partners of Triad are Syntek West, Inc. ("Syntek West"), a company owned by Gene E. Phillips, and Mr. Phillips. Triad subcontracts the property-level management and leasing of 19 of ART's commercial properties (shopping centers, office buildings and a merchandise mart) and its eight hotels to Regis Realty, Inc. ("Regis"), which is a company owned by Syntek West. Regis is entitled to receive property and construction management fees and leasing commissions in accordance with the terms of its property-level management agreement with Triad. See ITEM 10. "DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ADVISOR TO THE REGISTRANT--The Advisor."
Affiliates of BCM are also entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement as discussed in ITEM 10. "DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ADVISOR OF THE REGISTRANT--The Advisor."
ART has no employees itself, but PWSI has 916 employees and a majority- owned development subsidiary has 5 employees. Employees of BCM render services to ART.
Competition
Real Estate. The real estate business is highly competitive and ART competes with numerous entities engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS--Related Party Transactions"), some of which have greater financial resources than ART. Management believes that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of the property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as marketing, collections and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors with respect to commercial properties are the ease of access to the property, the adequacy of related facilities, such as parking, and sensitivity to market conditions in setting rent levels. With respect to apartments, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the tenants. With respect to hotels, competition is also based upon market served, i.e., transient, commercial or group users. Management believes that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the rate at which properties are renovated or the rate new properties are developed in the vicinity of each of ART's properties, in particular its improved and unimproved land, are also competitive factors.
To the extent that ART seeks to sell any of its properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate entities and financial institutions, also attempting to sell properties in areas where ART's properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.
As described above and in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS--Related Party Transactions," the officers of ART also serve as officers of certain other entities, each of which is also advised by BCM, and each of which has business objectives similar to ART's. ART's officers and advisor owe fiduciary duties to these other entities as well as to ART under applicable law. In determining to which entity a particular investment opportunity will be allocated, the officers and advisor consider the respective investment objectives of each entity and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each entity's existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity will be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all or some of the entities.
In addition, also as described in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS," ART also competes with other entities which are affiliates of BCM and which have investment objectives similar to ART's and that may compete with ART in purchasing, selling, leasing and financing real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, BCM has informed ART that it intends to continue to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.
ART is subject to all the risks incident to ownership and financing of real estate and interests therein, many of which relate to the general illiquidity of real estate investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in general or local economic conditions, changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage financing which may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property difficult or unattractive and which may make debt service burdensome; changes in real estate and zoning laws, increases in real estate taxes, federal or local economic or rent controls, floods, earth quakes, hurricanes and other acts of God and other factors beyond the control of management or BCM. The illiquidity of real estate investments may also impair the ability of management to respond promptly to changing circumstances. Management believes that such risks are partially mitigated by the diversification by geographic region and property type of ART's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios. However, to the extent new property investments, in particular improved and unimproved land, and mortgage lending are concentrated in any particular region the advantages of geographic diversification are mitigated.
Virtually all of ART's real estate, equity security holdings in IORI, TCI and NRLP and its trading portfolio of equity securities are held subject to secured indebtedness. Such borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on ART's assets and require fixed payments regardless of profitability. In the event of default, the lender may foreclose on ART's assets securing such indebtedness, and ART could lose its investment in the pledged assets.
Pizza Parlors. The pizza parlor business is highly competitive and is affected by changes in consumer tastes and eating habits, as well as national, regional and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. The performance of an individual pizza parlor can be affected by changes in traffic patterns, demographics, and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.
The quick-service restaurant industry is extremely competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. PWSI and its franchisees compete with a variety of other restaurants in the quick-service restaurant industry, including those that offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. These competitors include national and regional chains, franchisees of other restaurant chains and local owner-operated restaurants. Some of these competitors have been in existence longer and have an established market presence in certain geographic regions, and some have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than PWSI and its franchisees. PWSI competes for qualified franchisees with many other restaurant concepts, including national and regional restaurant chains.
PWSI's success is largely dependent upon the efforts of its management and other key personnel. The loss of the service of one or more members of management could have an adverse effect on PWSI's operations.
Significant transitions in management involve important risks, including potential loss of key personnel, difficulties in implementing changes to operational strategies and maintaining relationships with franchisees.
At December 31, 1999, PWSI owned and operated 50 and franchised six pizza parlors. The results achieved by PWSI's relatively small pizza parlor base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of pizza parlors in a more geographically dispersed area. Because of PWSI's relatively small pizza parlor base, an unsuccessful pizza parlor has a more significant effect on PWSI's results of operations than would be the case in a company owning more pizza parlors.
PWSI's existing pizza parlors, both owned and franchised, are located in California or Texas. At December 31, 1999, there were 50 pizza parlors in California and six in Texas. Accordingly, PWSI's results of operations may be affected by economic or other conditions in those regions. Also, given PWSI's present geographic concentration, publicity relating to PWSI's pizza parlors could have a more pronounced effect on PWSI's overall sales than might be the case if PWSI's pizza parlors were more broadly dispersed.
All of PWSI's owned pizza parlors are operated on premises leased from third parties. Most of the pizza parlor leases provide for a minimum annual rent and additional rental payments if sales volumes exceed specified amounts. There can be no assurance that PWSI will be able to renew leases upon expiration or that the lease terms upon renewal will be as favorable as the current lease terms. In 2000, PWSI plans to expand its franchised stores and to construct and open seven new company-owned stores.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
ART's principal offices are located at 10670 North Central Expressway, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75231 and are in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for ART's present operations.
Details of ART's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 1999, are set forth in Schedules III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." The discussions set forth below under the headings "Real Estate" and "Mortgage Loans" provide certain summary information concerning ART's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 1999, no single asset accounted for 10% or more of ART's total assets. At December 31, 1999, 84% of ART's assets consisted of real estate, 4% consisted of notes and interest receivable, 5% consisted of investments in the equity investees, including IORI and TCI, and 2% consisted of pizza parlor equipment and related goodwill. The remaining 5% of ART's assets were invested in cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and other assets. The percentage of ART's assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of ART's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
ART's real estate is geographically diverse. At December 31, 1999, ART's real estate was located in all geographic regions of the continental United States, other than the Northeast region, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below. ART also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest, Northeast and Midwest regions of the continental United States, as shown more specifically in the table under "Mortgage Loans" below.
Geographic Regions
Northeast region comprised of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, and the District of Columbia. ART has no properties in this region.
Southeast region comprised of the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. ART has 39 apartments, 4 commercial properties and 2 hotels in this region.
Southwest region comprised of the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. ART has 17 apartments and 8 commercial properties in this region.
Midwest region comprised of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin. ART has 15 apartments, 2 commercial properties and 1 hotel in this region.

Excluded from above are 67 parcels of improved and unimproved land and a single family residence, as described below.
Real Estate
At December 31, 1999, 89% of ART's assets were invested in real estate and the equity securities of real estate entities. ART has invested in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or nonleveraged basis. ART's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships, properties held for sale and investments in equity securities of IORI and TCI.
Types of Real Estate Investments. ART's real estate consists of apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, shopping centers and a merchandise mart), hotels and improved and unimproved land. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. Properties may be purchased subject to, or existing debt may be assumed and properties may be mortgaged, pledged or otherwise collateralized to obtain financing. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although ART has typically invested in developed real estate, it may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Board of Directors). To the extent that it invests in construction and development projects, such as Two Hickory Center described below, ART will be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.
In 1999, ART completed construction of Two Hickory Center, a 102,607 sq. ft. office building in Farmers Branch, Texas and NRLP completed construction of the Centura Office Building, a 410,901 sq. ft. office building also in Farmers Branch, Texas. Also at December 31, 1999, NRLP had under construction Lake Shore Villas, a 312 unit apartment in Harris County, Texas.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by ART are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of owned real estate (excluding 67 parcels of improved and unimproved land, and a single family residence, described below) at December 31, 1999.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, amount of commercial square footage and number of hotel rooms owned and does not reflect the value of ART's investment in each region. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for a detailed description of owned real estate.
Excluded from the table above, are a single family residence in Dallas, Texas and 67 parcels of improved and unimproved land consisting of: a 46.1 acre land parcel in Las Colinas, Texas; a 329.4 acre land parcel in Denver, Colorado; seven parcels of land in Dallas County, Texas, totaling 436.6 acres; four parcels of land in Irving, Texas, totaling 300.9 acres; a 420.0 acre land parcel in Duchense, Utah; a 82.4 acre land parcel in Oceanside, California; five parcels of land in Tarrant County, Texas, totaling 1,519.0 acres; two parcels of land in Harris County, Texas, totaling 251.0 acres; ten parcels of land in Collin County, Texas, totaling 754.6 acres; ten parcels of land in Farmers Branch, Texas, totaling 108.1 acres; three parcels of land in Plano, Texas, totaling 109.3 acres; a 1,448.0 acre land parcel in Austin, Texas; three parcels of land in Palm Desert, California, totaling 825.6 acres; a 41.8 acre land parcel in Travis County, Texas; a 234.9 acre parcel of land in Houston, Texas; a 54.2 acre land parcel in Fort Worth, Texas; a 137.0 acre land parcel in Lewisville, Texas; a 7.6 acre land parcel in Carrollton, Texas; a 19.5 acre land parcel in Santa Clarita, California; a 70.0 acre land parcel in Allen, Texas; a 147.4 acre land parcel in Nashville, Tennessee; three parcels of land in Riverside, California, totaling 1,697.8 acres; and seven additional land parcels totaling approximately 87.0 acres.

A summary of the activity in the owned real estate portfolio during 1999 is as follows:
Properties Held for Investment. Set forth below are the properties held for investment and the monthly rental rate for apartments and the average annual rental rate for commercial properties and the average daily room rate and room revenue divided by total available rooms for hotels and occupancy at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 for apartments and commercial properties and average occupancy during 1999, 1998 and 1997 for hotels:

Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of ART's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, secured by income-producing real estate, unimproved land and partnership interests. Management expects that the percentage of ART's assets invested in mortgage loans will decline as it has determined that ART will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, it may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in the portfolio. Mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, ART has acquired existing mortgage loans either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services ART's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1999, consisted of apartments, an office building, unimproved land and partnership interests. The type of properties subject to mortgages in which ART invests may be altered without a vote of stockholders.
As of December 31, 1999, the obligors on $13.3 million or 32.5% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of ART. Also at that date, $2.9 million or 7.1% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio was nonperforming.

Excluded are $24.8 million of mortgage notes secured by unimproved land and other security. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for additional details of ART's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1999 is as follows:
During 1999, $5.7 million in interest was collected and $40.0 million in principal was collected on mortgage notes receivable.
First Mortgage Loans. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal or all interest and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is ART's general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of ART's mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes first mortgage loans funded in 1999, as well as events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1999.

In the fourth quarter of 1998, $109,000 was received on the sale of 11 parcels of the collateral property in Taos, New Mexico. In August 1999, a paydown of $2.3 million was received. In September 1999, a paydown of $1.0 million was received. The loan had a principal balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 1999, and is cross- collateralized with the other JNC loans funded by NRLP.
Also in June 1998, NRLP funded a $365,000 loan to RB Land & Cattle, L.L.C. The loan was secured by 7,200 acres of unimproved land near Crowell, Texas and the personal guarantee of the owner and manager of the borrower. The loan matured in December 1998. All principal and interest were due at maturity. The loan, including accrued but unpaid interest, was collected in full in January 2000.
In March 1998, NRLP ceased receiving the required payments on a $3.0 million note receivable secured by an office building in Dallas, Texas. In October 1998, NRLP began foreclosure proceedings. In March 1999, payment in full was received, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In 1997 and 1998, NRLP funded a $3.8 million loan to Stratford & Graham Developers, L.L.C. The loan was secured by 1,485 acres of unimproved land in Riverside County, California. In 1999, an additional $305,000 was funded, increasing the loan balance to $4.1 million. The loan matured in June 1999. The loan was not paid at maturity. The borrower deeded the collateral property to NRLP in December 1999 in lieu of foreclosure. No
loss was incurred, as the fair market value of the property, less estimated costs of sale, exceeded the carrying value of the note.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. A wraparound mortgage loan, sometimes called an all-inclusive loan, is a mortgage loan having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. ART's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties on which it would otherwise make a first mortgage loan.
The following discussion briefly describes events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1999.
At December 31, 1998, NRLP's one wraparound mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $5.4 million and a net carrying value of $489,000 was in default. NRLP had been vigorously pursuing its rights regarding the loan to no avail. In December 1999, NRLP sold the note to BCM at its carrying value, retaining the right to receive any amounts collected by BCM in excess of the amount BCM paid for the note.
Junior Mortgage Loans. Junior mortgage loans are loans secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on the loans ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the loan, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes junior mortgage loans funded in 1999, as well as events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 1999.
In January 1999, NRLP collected in full a mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $350,000.
In August 1999, NRLP funded a $2.6 million loan to JNC. The loan was subsequently split into two pieces. The loans are secured by second liens on a 3.5 acre and a 1.2561 acre parcel of land in Dallas, Texas, the guarantee of the borrower and the personal guarantees of its shareholders. The loans bears interest at 16.0% per annum and matured in February 2000. All principal and interest were due at maturity. JNC used $2.3 million of the loan proceeds to paydown the Cuchara $4.2 million note receivable. In March 2000, the $2.0 million loan secured by the 3.5 acre land parcel was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest. Negotiations are in process to extend the remaining loan, which is cross-collateralized with the other JNC loans funded by NRLP.
In October 1998, NRLP funded three loans to JNC or affiliated entities. The first JNC loan of $1.0 million was secured by a second lien on 3.5 acres of land in Dallas, Texas, the guarantee of the borrower and the personal guarantees of its shareholders. This loan was collected in full in July 1999, prior to its maturity. The second loan, also $1.0 million, was secured by a second lien on 2.92 acres of land in Dallas, Texas, the guarantee of the borrower and the personal guarantees of its shareholders. This loan was collected in full in March 1999, also prior to its maturity. The third loan, in the amount of $2.1 million, was to Frisco Panther Partners, Ltd., a JNC affiliate. The loan is secured by a second lien on 408.23 acres of land in Frisco, Texas, the guarantee of the borrower and the personal guarantees of its partners. In January 1999, a $820,000 paydown was received on this loan. The loan originally matured in October 1999. At maturity, the loan was extended to March 2000, in exchange for an increase in the interest rate to 16.0% per annum. All principal and interest are due at maturity. This loan is cross-collateralized with the other JNC loans funded by NRLP.
In December 1998, NRLP funded $3.3 million of a $5.0 million loan commitment to JNC. In January 1999, a $1.3 million paydown was received on the loan and subsequently an additional $3.0 million was funded increasing the loan balance to $5.0 million. The loan is secured by a second lien on 1,791 acres of land in Denton County, Texas and a second lien on 91 acres of land in Collin County, Texas. At maturity in December 1999, the loan was extended to March 2000, in exchange for an increase in the interest rate to 16.0% per annum. All principal and interest are due at maturity. This loan is cross- collateralized with the other JNC loans funded by NRLP.
Other. In January and July 1999, NRLP collected a $1.7 million note receivable in full including a $400,000 participation fee.
In September 1999, in conjunction with the sale of the Oakhollow Apartments and the Windridge Apartments in Austin, Texas, NRLP provided $2.1 million in purchase money financing secured by limited partnership interest in two limited partnerships owned by the buyer. The financing bears interest at 16.0% per annum, requires monthly payments of interest only at 6.0%, beginning in February 2000 and required a $200,000 principal paydown in December 1999, which was not received and matures in August 2000. NRLP had the option to obtain the buyer's general and limited partnership interests in the partnerships in full satisfaction of the financing. In March 2000, NRLP agreed to forbear foreclosing on the collateral and release one of the partnership interests, in exchange for an initial payment of $250,000 and executed deeds of trusts on certain properties, which was received. In addition, the borrower is to make a $1.1 million payment in April 2000. Upon receipt of the April 2000 payment, NRLP will return the deeds of trust and terminate the option agreement. The borrower will execute a replacement promissory note for the remaining note balance, estimated to be $1.0 million, which will be unsecured, non-interest bearing and mature in April 2003.
In December 1999, a note with a principal balance of $1.2 million, secured by a pledge of a partnership interest in a partnership which owns real estate in Addison, Texas, matured. In exchange for extending the maturity date to April 2000, the interest rate was to 14.0% per annum. All other terms remained the same.
In August 1998, NRLP funded a $3.7 million loan to JNC. The loan was secured by a contract to purchase 387 acres of land in Collin County, Texas, the guarantee of the borrower and the personal guarantees of its shareholders. In January 1999, ART purchased the contract from JNC and acquired the land. In connection with the purchase, GCLP funded an additional $6.0 million of its $125.0 million loan commitment to ART. A portion of the funds were used to payoff the $3.7 million loan to NRLP, including accrued but unpaid interest, paydown by $1.3 million another JNC loan and paydown by $820,000 the JNC Frisco Panther Partners Ltd. loan, discussed above.
Also in August 1998, NRLP funded a $635,000 loan to La Quinta Partners, LLC. The loan was secured by interest bearing accounts prior to being used as escrow deposits toward the purchase of a total of 956 acres of land in La Quinta, California, and the personal guarantee of the manager of the borrower. The loan matured in November 1998. All principal and interest were due at maturity. In November and December 1998, $250,000 was received in principal paydowns. In the second quarter of 1999, the loan was modified, increasing the interest rate to 15.0% per annum and extending the maturity to November 1999. Accrued but unpaid interest was added to the principal balance, increasing it by $42,000 to $402,000. In the fourth quarter of 1999, an additional $2,000 was funded increasing the loan balance to $404,000. In March 2000, $25,000 in interest was collected and the loan's maturity was extended to April 2000.

The loan bore interest at 12.0% per annum, required monthly payments of interest only and had an extended maturity of September 1999. In November 1999, the note was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
Related Party. In 1998 and 1999, GCLP funded $124.4 million of a $125.0 million loan commitment to ART. The loan is secured by second liens on six ART properties in Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, the stock of ART Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ART that owns 3,349,535 NRLP units of limited partner interest, the stock of NMC, the general partner of NRLP, 678,475 NRLP units of limited partner interest owned by BCM, and 283,034 NRLP units of limited partner interest owned by ART.

GCLP is consolidated for financial statement purposes and the loan balance is eliminated in consolidation.
In December 1998, in connection with the Moorman litigation settlement, NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ART and the general partner of NRLP, assumed responsibility for repayment to NRLP of the $12.2 million paid by NRLP to the Moorman Class Members and legal counsel. The loan bears interest at a variable rate, currently 8.0% per annum, and requires annual payments of accrued interest plus principal payments of $500,000 in each of the first three years, $750,000 in each of the next three years, $1.0 million in each of the next three years, with payment in full of the remaining balance in the tenth year. The note is guaranteed by ART. The note matures upon the earlier of the liquidation or dissolution of NRLP, NMC ceasing to be general partner or ten years from March 31, 1999, the date of the first cash distribution to the Moorman Class Members. NRLP is consolidated for financial statement purposes and the loan balance is eliminated in consolidation.
In February 1999, a $5.0 million unsecured loan was funded by GCLP to One Realco Corporation, formerly Davister Corp., which at December 31, 1999, owned approximately 15.8% of the outstanding shares of ART's Common Stock. The loan bears interest at 12.0% per annum and matured in February 2000. All principal and interest were due at maturity. All accrued but unpaid interest was collected in March 2000 and the loan's maturity was extended to February 2002. All other terms of the loan remained unchanged. The loan is guaranteed by BCM.
In 1998, NRLP funded a $1.8 million loan commitment to Warwick of Summit, Inc. ("Warwick"), of which $619,000 was used to repay a Warwick affiliate's loan from NRLP.

Morgan, a Warwick shareholder, was elected a director of NMC, the general partner of NRLP.
Beginning in 1997 and through January 1999, NRLP funded a $1.6 million loan commitment to Bordeaux Investments Two, L.L.C. ("Bordeaux"). The loan is secured by (1) a 100% membership interest in Bordeaux, which owns a shopping center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; (2) 100% of the stock of Bordeaux Investments One, Inc., which owns 6.5 acres of undeveloped land in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and (3) the personal guarantees of the Bordeaux members.

Until November 1998, the loan required monthly payments of interest only at 12.0% per annum, with the deferred interest payable at maturity in January 1999. In November 1998, the loan was modified to allow payments based on monthly cash flow of the collateral property and the maturity date was extended to December 1999. In the second quarter of 1999, the loan was again modified, increasing the loan commitment to $2.1 million and an additional $33,000 was funded. In the third quarter of 1999, an additional $213,000 was funded. The property has had no cash flow, therefore, NRLP ceased accruing interest on the loan in the second quarter of 1999. In October 1999, a $724,000 paydown was received on the loan by NRLP, which was applied first to accrued interest due of $261,000 then to principal, reducing the loan balance to $1.4 million.

Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships
Real estate entities. ART's investment in real estate entities includes equity securities of two publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts, IORI and TCI, and interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. BCM, ART's advisor, also serves as advisor to IORI and TCI.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of IORI, TCI and NRLP in 1989, ART has made additional investments in the equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The cost with respect to shares of IORI and TCI at December 31, 1999 totaled $24.1 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $25.5 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of the equity securities of IORI and TCI was $39.8 million at December 31, 1999 and the aggregate market value of the equity securities of IORI and TCI was $44.6 million and $60.8 million for NRLP. The aggregate investee book value of the equity securities of IORI and TCI based upon the December 31, 1999 financial statements of each entity was $77.9 million. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
The Board of Directors has authorized the expenditure of up to an aggregate of $35.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, units of NRLP and shares of IORI and TCI, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. As of December 31, 1999, ART had expended $6.3 million to acquire units of NRLP and an aggregate of $8.0 million to acquire shares of IORI and TCI, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. ART expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of IORI and TCI.
The equity securities of IORI, TCI and NRLP were purchased for the purpose of investment based principally on the opinion of management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination to purchase additional equity securities of IORI and TCI will be made on an entity-by-entity basis and will depend on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities. Substantially all of the equity securities of IORI, TCI and NRLP are pledged as collateral for borrowings.
Pertinent information regarding ART's investment in the equity securities of the IORI and TCI at December 31, 1999, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
Each of IORI and TCI owns a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. ART's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
ART does not have a controlling equity interest in either of IORI or TCI and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of either of them. However,
due to ART's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of IORI and TCI and that IORI and TCI have the same advisor as ART and that Karl L. Blaha, a Director and President of ART, is also the President of IORI, TCI and BCM, ART's advisor, ART may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of IORI and TCI. ART accounts for its investment in IORI and TCI using the equity method. Under the equity method, ART recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of IORI and TCI currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. ART discontinued accounting for its investment in NRLP under the equity method as of December 31, 1998, due to the election of NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ART, as general partner of NRLP and NOLP. Since December 31, 1998, the accounts and operations of NRLP have been consolidated with those of ART. The carrying value of ART's investment in IORI and TCI, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for ART's proportionate share of each of IORI's and TCI's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of IORI and TCI based upon information publicly reported by each entity.
IORI. IORI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized on December 14, 1984 as a California business trust and commenced operations on April 10, 1985.

On September 25, 1998, TCI and Continental Mortgage and Equity Trust ("CMET"), both, at the time, equity investees of ART, jointly announced the agreement of their respective Boards for TCI to acquire CMET through merger. At special meetings held on September 28, 1999, the stockholders of both companies approved the merger transaction. The merger was completed on November 30, 1999. Pursuant to the merger agreement, TCI acquired all of the outstanding CMET shares of beneficial interest in a tax-free exchange of shares, issuing 1.181 shares of its common stock for each outstanding CMET share.
TCI has investment policies similar to those of IORI. TCI holds equity investments in apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers) and hotels throughout the continental United States with a concentration in the Southeast and Southwest regions. At December 31, 1999, TCI owned 123 income producing properties located in 16 states. These properties consisted of 69 apartments comprising 11,232 units, 30 office buildings with an aggregate of 3.8 million sq. ft., 14 industrial warehouses with an aggregate of 2.2 million sq. ft., six shopping centers with an aggregate of 622,661 sq. ft., a fitness club with 56,532 sq. ft. and four hotels with a total of 209 rooms. TCI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the continental United States.
TCI reported net income of $30.2 million in 1999 as compared to net income of $6.9 million in 1998. TCI's net income for 1999 included gains on the sale of real estate of $40.5 million whereas its net income for 1998

At December 31, 1999, TCI owned 345,728 shares of IORI's common stock, approximately 22.6% of the shares then outstanding.
TCI has paid quarterly dividends since the fourth quarter of 1995. In 1999, ART received a total of $1.7 million in dividends from TCI.
Elm Fork, L.P. In September 1997, a limited partnership, of which ART is the 1% general partner and 21.5% limited partner, purchased a 422.4 acre parcel of unimproved land in Denton County, Texas, for $16.0 million in cash. ART contributed $3.6 million in cash with the remaining $12.4 million being contributed by the other limited partners. In September 1997, the partnership obtained financing of $6.5 million secured by the land. The net financing proceeds were distributed to the partners and ART received a return of $2.9 million of its initial investment. The partnership agreement also provides that the limited partners receive a 12% preferred cumulative return before any sharing of partnership profits occurs. At December 31, 1999, all 422.4 acres remained to be sold.
ITEM 3.
