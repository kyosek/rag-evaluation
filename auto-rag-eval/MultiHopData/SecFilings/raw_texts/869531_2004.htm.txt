Item 2. Our properties
As described in Item 1, Business Development, above, we own mineral prospects in Bolivia that we believe are prospectively valuable for mineral operations. These include:
The Tipuani-Cangalli prospects (discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b), below), and
The Precambrian Shield properties (discussed in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f), below.
(a) The Cangalli claims.
In October 1995, we began reviewing potential mining opportunities in Bolivia. Thereafter, we conducted a site visit to the Tipuani Gold Mining District (approximately 62 miles north of the Bolivian capital of La Paz). Our representatives traveled to the town of Cangalli, approximately two kilometers down river from the town of Tipuani, a well-known gold mining center in Bolivia. We hired an independent geologist to evaluate the Cangalli area. This geologist reported that the area merited further study and was highly prospective for sizeable gold deposits.
(i) Contract for exploration and mining on the Cangalli properties.
Based on this favorable report, along with other pre-existing reports on the Tipuani/Cangalli area, in January 1996 (through one of our now-inactive subsidiaries) we entered into an agreement with United Cangalli Gold Mining Cooperative, Ltd. (“UCL”), a Bolivian cooperative consisting of 118 members. We operated under this contract from the date of its signing through July 2, 2002.
(ii) Purchase of the Cangalli properties from UCL.
On July 2, 2002, we purchased 100% of all right, title and interest in and to the mining concessions comprising the Cangalli claims. We actually ended up purchasing 5,125 acres. This purchase completely freed our Cangalli properties from any royalty whatsoever. We paid $300,000 in cash, 3,944,500 shares of Golden Eagle’s restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share, and assumed $175,000 of UCL’s existing debt payable by us over the course of 4 years. The UCL debt has now been paid down to $77,359. These shares were issued for investment purposes to persons who were neither citizens nor residents of the United States pursuant to exemptions from registration found in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation S.
We also agreed in a separate lease agreement to lease the use of the 1,000-foot deep Cangalli shaft back to the UCL for a period of 99 years, with a 10% gross royalty on gold production back to Golden Eagle, so that the UCL members not working for us could remain involved in gold mining in their own community.
The UCL leadership distributed 35,000 shares of our common stock to each UCL member. This distribution was accomplished pursuant to the provisions of Regulation S. During 2003, we issued the UCL an additional 133,000 shares of Golden Eagle stock valued at $22,610 to satisfy additional claims.
Golden Eagle paid one-time transfer taxes of $9,000 in the purchase. We also pay $2,075 per year to the Bolivian government in mining patent (concession) fees. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation to be able to maintain our rights over the Cangalli claims in perpetuity.
(iii) Production from our Cangalli mine
We received an investment of $1.3 million in early 2002 to initiate a 1,000 tonne per day plant and to build out our interior mine infrastructure. On September 30, 2002, we commenced operations at our Cangalli gold mine at the rate of 1,000 tonnes per day from our open pit operation. By November, we had increased our production capacity to 2,000 tonnes per day. By the end of the fourth quarter, December 31, 2002, we had processed 92,700 tonnes of ore, and had recovered 43,847 grams, or 1,410 troy ounces, of gold.
On February 10, 2003, we announced the conversion from our open pit operations to more cost-effective underground block caving from our interior mine while maintaining a production capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day.
During the second quarter of 2003, we received the necessary funding in the amount of approximately $600,000 to expand our production capacity from 2,000 tonnes per day to 3,500 tonnes per day. In July 2003, we completed construction of our 3,500 tonne per day plant and began processing material at an increased rate. We had projected that once we had reached 3,500 tonnes per day on a sustained basis, our Cangalli gold operation would reach and surpass the break even point, and would enter into a sustained positive cash flow. While we reached full capacity of 3,500 tonnes per day on a limited basis, we were unable to continue to produce at that level as a result of weather delays during the fourth quarter of 2003. We also encountered a phenomenon in the cemented conglomerate above the draw points in our block caving known as “doming” in which the ore would form large domes and cease to flow evenly to the draw points for extraction.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, we employed many different blasting techniques in an attempt to solve the issues involved with doming. However, due to the danger associated with the potential collapse of the domed areas while miners were working within them and because our studies have shown that the bedded paystreaks in the paleo-placer conglomerate deposits contain a higher gold grade per tonne of ore, we elected to focus our attention on the development of a more targeted mine plan.
During the first two quarters of 2004 we implemented a mining technique known as targeted planar subsidence (TPS), in which the paystreaks were mined along their plane. Initially, this mining took place along a 25-meter work face, and as the work face advances, the roof behind was allowed to collapse, or subside, in a controlled manner similar to longwalling now being used in the coal industry. The average grade resulting from the paystreak sampling program that resulted in our estimate of proven and probable reserves in our Cangalli underground mine was 3.73 grams of gold per tonne, which is almost exactly 10 times higher than the average grade that has historically been recovered in Golden Eagle’s plant. We anticipated that if we were able to achieve a higher grade, we would be able to reduce our cost-per-ounce in production. During the first two quarters of 2004, we experienced a shakeout period on TPS production and we consistently achieved grades in the range of 3 grams per tonne. We made significant progress in developing this mining method and steadily increased TPS production. Our gold production at our Cangalli mine increased by nearly 11% from the first quarter 2004 to the second quarter 2004 as a result of the increase in our recovered grade from TPS mining.
On June 25, 2004, we announced we had temporarily ceased mining operations at our Cangalli mine and plant as a result of road blockades by local citizens protesting various government policies in Caranavi, Bolivia, a town half way between La Paz and our Cangalli mine. The roadblocks prevented the delivery of needed supplies and materials to the mine for operations. The same blockade, approximately 80 miles from Cangalli, also hampered operations of the power sub-station in Guanay, Bolivia. This sub-station provides electricity to Golden Eagle’s Cangalli operation, and the power failures halted all mining and processing activities.
Before the strike issues were settled, during June 2004, we also ceased gold mining operations at our Cangalli property as a result of issues that arose among the United Cangalli Gold Mining Cooperative, Ltd. (UCL), which had sold us a 5,000-acre mining concession, and FENCOMIN, the Bolivian governmental regulator of cooperatives, as well as other Bolivian regulators. The legal issues involving the UCL had nothing whatsoever to do with Golden Eagle. The most pressing legal dispute between UCL and the Bolivian governmental regulators involved the UCL’s mandatory contributions to the National Mining Pension Fund that were in arrears and the failure of the UCL to observe legal formalities regarding its formation, registration and ongoing operation. These legal disputes, while having nothing to do with Golden Eagle, created an insecure atmosphere at our Cangalli gold mine and raised serious questions about whether formal intervention would occur and substantially hamper operations.
Although the issues surrounding the local farmers’ strike have been settled, the issues relating to the UCL continue to be a threat to our ability to continue mining operations on our Cangalli claim. We are taking legal action to clarify the situation and quiet our title to the Cangalli claim. We are also asking the Court for a declaratory judgment definitively establishing our right to operate on the Cangalli property claim unencumbered. To date, no court in Bolivia has ruled on these issues.
(iv) Efforts to obtain additional production
Because of the cessation of operations at our Cangalli claim and the availability of equipment while the related issues were being resolved, in September 2004 we entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated, neighboring landowner to produce gold from its claims. Although we announced the commencement of production operations in October 2004, these operations did not prove to be cost-effective as a result of the high cost of diesel fuel in the region, so we ceased our participation in these operations. Since production costs exceeded revenue and since we were entitled to 50% of the net revenue after costs we did not book any revenue from the joint venture during 2004.
In October 2004, we also announced plans to accelerate our efforts to obtain production from a site identified in the Tipuani prospect (described below). Because of our working capital shortages, we have not been able to make any significant progress toward this goal.
On February 24, 2004, we announced that we had estimated proven and probable gold reserves on our Cangalli mining claims located in the Tipuani Gold District of western Bolivia. Those reserves were estimated in a report (the “reserve report”) dated February 2004, by Carlos Thompson, Reg. Eng., an independent economic geologist and consultant, as well as Giovanni Viscarra, Reg. Eng., a geologist and Golden Eagle’s Cangalli mine superintendent. During March 2005, Mr. Viscarra reviewed and reconfirmed the original findings in the February 2004 reserve report. The report states that the reserves were estimated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Guides for the Preparation of Registration Statements and with the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration’s “Guide for Reporting Exploration Information, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves” dated March 1, 1999. In preparing the reserve report and estimated mineral reserves, Mr. Thompson was acting as a consultant to Golden Eagle, and Mr. Viscarra was acting as an employee of Golden Eagle’s operating subsidiary. Messrs. Thompson and Viscarra have consented to the public release of the information contained in this Form 10-K and the accompanying financial statements.
We have continued to report reserves for the Cangalli claims notwithstanding the current cessation of production because we believe that it is likely that we will be able to recommence production in the future. In addition, we believe that the Cangalli proven and probable reserves are still economically and legally extractable. By “legally extractable” we mean that we own the underlying mining concessions at the Cangalli mine free and clear, in addition to which we have all necessary and legal environmental permits, all of which would legally entitle us to mine. Our current decision regarding the cessation of production is based on post-extraction considerations that have to do with the possibility of the encumbrance of gold once produced that would make it difficult to meet our production-related obligations. If we are not able to recommence production operations within a reasonable period, then the reserves reported for Cangalli claims may be considered valueless because they will not be mineable in the social and political context existing in Bolivia, or due to complications related to the UCL’s legal problems that are unrelated to us, but which nevertheless continue to affect us significantly. As a result,this circumstance may require future further impairment. Furthermore, the reserve report was prepared at a time when the mine was in production and economic circumstances were different than they are presently. Because the mine has been closed for more than nine months at the present time, we will incur a significant amount of additional costs to reopen the mine, and consideration of these costs may adversely impact the economics of production and the reserve report. In addition, during the period and subsequent to the year-end, the cost of diesel fuel and other operating costs have increased, resulting in the discontinuation of our joint venture operation. These cost increases, while somewhat offset by significant increases in the international price for gold, may also impact any future operations at our Cangalli claim. Nevertheless, we have determined that it is appropriate to continue to report reserves for the Cangalli claims based on all of the facts and circumstances considered above. We have also received the opinion of Bolivian counsel that there is an 80% probability that the Cangalli mine can return to full production within the next 5 years. This probability, of course, is linked to the outcome of the litigation discussed above. As with all litigation, we cannot assure the outcome will be positive for Golden Eagle.
As stated above, during March 2005, the co-author of the reserve report reviewed the report and the current situation at Cangalli and reconfirmed his estimations, less the production during 2004, as is indicated in the following charts:

As used in the preceding table,
Proven (or measured) reserves are reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well-established; and
probable (or indicated) reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Golden Eagle’s Cangalli mining concessions in the Tipuani Gold District Cangalli claims are found in the middle of a geological formation known as the Apollo-Caranavi Trench in a valley formed by the Tipuani River and its tributaries. The bedrock is undifferentiated Ordovician shales, covered by the Cangalli formation of conglomerates of the Late Tertiary age. Since the Quaternary, the Tipuani River has been creating its present course, mainly by cutting the conglomerates and re-concentrating the gold found in those conglomerates.
The stated scope of the reserve report was to report on a sampling program carried out over the course of three months at the end of 2003, and during the month of January 2004, on a 3.68-hectare (9.1 acre) recent Quaternary alluvial terrace deposited by the Tipuani River. This sampling program took place in the current open pit, and the surrounding undisturbed area, in which Golden Eagle is now mining.
The reserve report also reported on a sampling program in outcropping pay streaks, or horizontal bedded layers within the cemented conglomerate. These gold bearing pay streaks, or horizontal beds, also were sampled in Golden Eagle’s underground mine which penetrates over 330 meters (1,086 feet) into the conglomerate material at our Cueva Playa the site of our Cangalli mine. When it was operating, this underground mine contributed ore to our Cueva Playa gold recovery plant through a mining method known as conal subsidence block caving. This mining technique opens draw points under the conglomerate and allows the ore to cave, or subside, to the draw points for extraction and processing. Our studies have shown that the bedded pay streaks contain a higher gold grade per tonne of ore, we have elected to focus our attention on the development of a more targeted mine plan. Based on the reserve report and assuming (without assurance) that the legal issues are resolved so that we can recommence operations on our Cangalli claim, Golden Eagle proposes to continue to develop the proven and probable open pit reserves. While our initial goal will be to mine ore in its ongoing operation, mining at a rate of 3,000 tonnes per day, we cannot offer any assurance as to the costs or period of time that will be necessary before we will be able to do so, if at all.
The reserve report discussed here is based on a number of assumptions, and its conclusions are sensitive to the world market for gold. According to the reserve report, the authors assumed a gold price per troy ounce of $360 based on a two-year historical average price. That price is less than the current price at the time of the filing of this report of approximately $440 per troy ounce of gold.
Among the other assumptions set forth in the reserve report is the fact that the geological and economic cutoff grades for gold is set at 0.2 grams per tonne in the open pit, and 0.66 grams per tonne in the underground mine, which are very sensitive to the price of gold. The report also assumes continued political and labor stability in Bolivia and the Cangalli area.
(b) The Tipuani prospect.
In November 1999 and October 2000, we acquired four mining claims in the Tipuani Gold Mining District, surrounding our Cangalli claims, 62 miles north of La Paz, Bolivia, with a total acreage of approximately 69,000 acres. Our geological reconnaissance studies indicated that these properties were highly prospective for gold deposits similar to that found on the Cangalli Properties. In exchange we committed to pay to the Bolivian government annual fees of $27,825. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation to be able to maintain our rights over these properties in perpetuity.
During 2004, Golden Eagle announced that as a result of geological reconnaissance work further identifying and mapping the gold bearing conglomerate material in the paleochannel of the ancient Tipuani River basin, we reduced our landholdings in the Tipuani properties from 74,000 acres (116 square miles) to 49,900 acres (78 square miles). As a result of this reduction, we reduced our obligation to pay concession patent fees, and we now have a more focused approach to its exploration activities in the pay streaks in the paleochannel found on its gold concessions in the area. We do not believe that the reduction in acreage resulted in the loss of any valuable mineralized area.
At December 31, 2004, we also owned 44,900 acres in the Tipuani prospect (not including the 5,000-acre Cangalli claim) covering an 18-mile section of the ancient paleo-channel of the Tipuani River system. This area is not affected by the dispute between the UCL and the Bolivian government and we are investigating the possibility of moving our recovery plant to an alternate site on our property. If we were to abandon our current mine site, we may have to write off certain mining claims and development costs. Should we ever be able to resume mining on the 5,000-acre Cangalli claim, we will incur substantial startup costs the funding for which we do not currently have.
(c) History of the Cangalli and the Tipuani Gold Mining District of Bolivia
Gold mining in the Tipuani Gold Mining District, in which the Cangalli and Tipuani properties are found, can be traced back to pre-Inca times (1000 to 1500 A.D.). During the Inca dominion, natives worked gold placers in the Tipuani River and her tributary rivers, the Ancoma and Yani, and also in the gold-bearing quartz veins of the Cordillera (in the high Andes Mountains).
Early Spanish historians recorded that the province of Larecaja, in which the Tipuani Gold Mining District is located, contributed about 126 kg of gold per year to the Inca Emperor at Illabaya. For this and other purposes, the Incan natives constructed a network of roads in Bolivia and Peru, some of which are still in use today.
During the Spanish rule, after the “Conquest,” the Indians stopped all mining. They destroyed roads, blocked entrances to the mines, and established a death penalty for those disclosing to the conquerors the whereabouts of any mining centers.
After many hardships and loss of life, the Spaniards re-started their mining attempts from 1562 to 1566 at Roman Playa on the Tipuani River. Great amounts of gold were produced. The use of iron tools and gunpowder for mining was inaugurated about 1571. In 1602, the Spaniards reached the site where the town of Tipuani now stands (2 km upriver from Cangalli). For the first time, they met Portuguese expeditions in search of gold advancing up the Amazon tributaries from Brazil. During the years thereafter, several pitched battles were waged over these goldfields between the Spanish and Portuguese, and one was fought on the current site of the Cangalli Township. In 1620, workers were imported from Brazil into the Bolivian goldfields as large fortunes were being made with great success. In 1780, the revolt of mitayos, or slave workers, stopped the mining in the area for a few years.
In 1782, a miner named Rodriguez and the two Novos brothers successfully worked the Tipuani River terraces. Andres Coll and Idelfonso Villamil Blanco, and their descendants, worked in the area until 1867. Villamil was the first to exploit the rich lower terraces and river gravels below water level. Also during this period, several foreign-based companies arrived from Great Britain, the United States, Germany, and other countries.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Bolivian Gold Exploration Company (BOLGO) introduced the first methods of mechanized work. Acting as a modern large enterprise, BOLGO leased its large concessions to the Companie Aramayo de Mines en Bolivia in 1932, which in turn spent a lot of time, money and energy to efficiently mine the gold deposits in their concessions. They were the first to sink deep shafts into the Cangalli conglomerate to work the terraces in Unutuluni, some 15 km (9 mi) upriver from the town of Tipuani.
In 1952, the Bolivian government nationalized all of the BOLGO and Aramayo concessions. The government administered these properties through the Bolivian Miners’ Bank, which leased them to the Federation of Mining Cooperatives. This group preferred to work the river gravels using small vertical shafts and adits to make contact with the bedrock, even beneath the river itself. Some of the upper terraces were also worked by the cooperatives by booming and sluicing when sufficient water was available.
In 1956, a North American company, South American Placers, Inc. (“SAPI”), obtained large concessions in the lower Tipuani, Challana, Mapiri, Coroico, and Kaka Rivers. It began dredging at Teoponte on the Kaka River in 1959, and continued working successfully for nearly 30 years. This SAPI dredge set records for gold production for day, month and year during its active work period at the mouth of the Tipuani River. In the 1960‘s, the Tidewater Co. and Condor Mining, Inc. entered the same areas with some success.
Due to the perceived near-exhaustion of the best-known deposits of river gravels, many people have abandoned the Tipuani area. Lately, others have been trying to work the remaining river areas and terraces, while making some technical improvements such as deeper shafts and better underground workings. Historical sources have estimated that the total production of gold from the Tipuani District may reach figures close to 200 tonnes of gold for each of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. It was near 200 tonnes for the 19th century and about 500 tonnes for the 20th century. For its known history of almost 1,000 years of mining, according to these historical sources, the Tipuani District may have produced no less than 1,000 metric tonnes of gold, or more than 32 million troy ounces. Based on information from Aramayo Company records from the 1930s and 1940s, the ore grades mined were usually very high, from a few grams to many troy ounces of gold per tonne.
(d) The Precambrian prospect.
In June of 2001, we acquired four mining claims in Bolivia’s Precambrian Shield with a total acreage of approximately 125,000 acres, as well as the existing reports on the area, for 10 million shares of our common restricted stock valued at $300,000 ($0.03 per share). These shares were issued to persons who were not United States citizens or residents for investment purposes pursuant to exemptions from registration found in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Regulation S. The size of our holding in the Precambrian Shield of Bolivia has decreased and increased as we have reduced the size of our concessions with the Bolivian government, and as we have acquired new prospects.
We pay $54,600 per year to the Bolivian government in mining patent fees for our Precambrian Prospect. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation we have to be able to maintain our rights over these properties in perpetuity.
Our geologists explored these prospects and found them to be highly prospective for extensive near surface gold mineralization and deeper mineralized volcanogenic massive sulphides (“VMS”) systems containing gold and copper.
(e) Buen Futuro claim
(i) Acquisition
Golden Eagle purchased the Buen Futuro claim from Celia Calla de Arraya, a Bolivian, and her son-in-law, Dr. Michael H. Biste, a geologist who has worked extensively in the area, in June 2003. We amended the contract in December 2003 and March 2005. The terms of the acquisition included a 3% net smelter return, payments of $50,000 cash and shares of restricted Golden Eagle common stock valued at $75,000, and a promise to make the following additional payments:
Cash Shares (Value)
March 2005 $100,000 $25,000
September 2005 $100,000 $75,000
We have negotiated an extension regarding the March 2005 payment, agreeing to pay an additional $25,000, for a total of $125,000 in ten equal payments of $12,500 beginning May 1, 2005. Under the agreement with Mrs. Calla de Arraya and Dr. Biste, Golden Eagle undertook several obligations in addition to the payment obligations described above. These obligations included:
Our agreement to maintain an exploration program to replace mineral reserves as they are depleted through mining as long as the potential for feasible mineral reserves continues on the ore deposits found within the Buen Futuro concession.
Our agreement to invest $1 million in exploration by November 23, 2006. Golden Eagle has expended approximately $140,000 to date. We will only be able to meet this commitment if we receive a significant amount of additional financing, which cannot be assured.
Our agreement requires us to enter into mineral production on the Buen Futuro concession by May 23, 2005, and to expend a minimum of $2,000,000 to initiate that production. We believe that the acquisition of the Gold Bar mill and plant for $3,600,000 will satisfy this investment requirement if we are able to obtain financing and begin construction. We are negotiating with Ms. Calla de Arraya regarding granting a two-year extension of the period in which production must commence. While we cannot guarantee that the extension will be granted, we believe that it is probable that it will be granted since substantial progress has been made toward placing the Buen Futuro prospect into production.
There are no stated penalties for failure to comply with these commitments. The initial build out of the gold plant and other infrastructure improvements will require a capital investment of about $10,000,000. We believe that the sellers of the Buen Futuro claim to us realize that we have been operating in good faith and will cooperate with us in reaching appropriate contractual modifications.
(ii) The prospect.
Golden Eagle announced May 30, 2003, that it signed a Letter of Intent to acquire 100% of the Buen Futuro mining claim located squarely in the center of Golden Eagle’s 125,000-acre landholding in the Precambrian Shield 162 miles north of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and 11 miles east of the town of Ascension de Guarayos. The Buen Futuro claim consists of 2,500 acres and contains three well-identified gold/copper ore bodies. These ore bodies are found in an oxide zone 130 to 200 feet thick, as well as a supergene copper-enriched zone extending from the oxide zone to a depth of 320 feet, sitting on top of strata-bound volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralization. Golden Eagle exercised its rights to purchase the Buen Futuro property in June 2003. A private contract, as well as a recorded public contract, were signed and filed with the Superintendency of Mines of the Department of Santa Cruz on December 12, 2003.
We believe that the Buen Futuro gold/copper deposits, surrounded by Golden Eagle’s Precambrian claims, are just part of a much larger trend of VMS clusters that runs both north and south within Golden Eagle’s 136,500 acres. A recent study was carried out on the prospect by Dr. Michael Biste, a Golden Eagle consultant who is an expert on the Precambrian geology of eastern Bolivia. The exploration data resulted from the northern part of the company’s Dos Piyos claim, and the southwest portion of the Cobra claim. Both properties cover the northern part of the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend and the investigated ground comprised 23 square miles. Dr. Biste prepared a remote sensing study consisting of an interpretation of satellite images, aerial photographs, and open file airborne magnetic and radiometric data. He further reexamined historic reconnaissance exploration data of the two claims and applied modern computer based methods for an integrated data interpretation. In addition, Dr. Biste used the results of geological mapping over 44 linear miles, magnetic ground surveys of over 9 miles and soil sampling over a distance of 18 miles, as well as electromagnetic (HLEM) data along two extensive test lines. Despite the wide line spacing of 0.6 miles, Dr. Biste was able to identify a continuous metamorphosed, bi-modal volcano-sedimentary sequence with characteristics very similar to the host rock of the Buen Futuro (formerly Miguela) volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) mineralization. Buen Futuro is located 12 miles southwest of the investigated area. The HLEM survey so far has confirmed three parallel striking conductors, which Dr. Biste believes represent a primary VMS mineralization which is covered by an oxide layer at least 30 meters deep. The lateritic soil at the surface carries geochemically anomalous values for gold, copper and zinc. Golden Eagle’s summary study covers 3.6 miles of the Trend and the remote sensing data shows that the favorable VMS lithology strikes further to the northeast. We consider these findings to be a significant step toward identifying new gold-copper mineralization similar to the Buen Futuro ore bodies. Dr. Biste believes that field work will continue to demonstrate that the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend is now likely to extend over at least 21 linear miles within Golden Eagle’s Precambrian properties.
We project that this acquisition, and our current landholding in the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend, provide us with several important opportunities for future development. Nevertheless, these opportunities would be contingent upon our ability to raise the needed development capital either through operations, equity funding, debt financing or by entering into joint venture relationships.
The Buen Futuro VMS mineralization was initially identified by Dr. Biste through geochemical surveys, and subsequently confirmed using Induced Polarization (IP) and Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys. Eventually, between 1993 and 1997, 800 miles of exploration trails were cut through the jungle to take a total of 21,000 samples on the Buen Futuro and surrounding areas. A total of 8,400 feet of auger drilling was performed initially, with 11,000 feet of additional reverse circulation drilling and 27,000 feet of diamond core drilling. A total of 8 miles of trenches were dug and 5,500 trench samples were taken and analyzed.
We own the underlying mineral rights on the Buen Futuro project through the purchase of mineral concession rights that had been granted by the Bolivian government. However, we had to purchase the surface land rights before we could actually begin to disturb the surface with mining and development activities. We have purchased 519 acres of surface rights covering the areas that we intend to mine in the Buen Futuro A Zone, as well as all areas necessary for the location of our mill, recovery plant, fresh water ponds, tailings impoundments and mine camp site. As other surface rights become necessary, we expect to acquire those rights under reasonable terms also.
(iii) Buen Futuro reserves
As of year-end 2003, we estimated proven and probable gold and copper reserves on our Buen Futuro mining concession located in the Precambrian Shield of eastern Bolivia. On March 1, 2005 the reserve report was reviewed and reconfirmed. Those reserves estimations, and the subsequent confirmation of reserves during 2005, were performed by the principal author Michael H. Biste, Ph.D., one of the persons who sold the Buen Futuro prospect to us. Dr. Biste as well as co-authors Ronald l Atwood Ph.D and Hugo Aparacio, Registered Engineer originally prepared a report dated February 2004. The report states that the reserves were estimated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Guides for the Preparation of Registration Statements and with the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration’s “Guide for Reporting Exploration Information, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves” dated March 1, 1999. In preparing the reserve report and estimated mineral reserves, Dr. Biste was acting as a consultant to Golden Eagle. Golden Eagle acquired the Buen Futuro property and related information from a Bolivian national in June 2003. At the time, Golden Eagle entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Biste by which Golden Eagle has paid him $3,000 per month and Golden Eagle common stock with a value of $2,000 per month. Dr. Biste and his co-authors have consented to the public release of the information contained in this Form 10-K.
Dr. Biste stated that the scope of his report was a recompilation of pertinent geological and sampling data obtained from mineral exploration on the Buen Futuro property since 1993, including trench, auger, diamond, and reverse circulation drilling performed under his supervision from 1993 through 1998. According to Dr. Biste’s report, the exploration work and his analysis indicate that three individual massive sulfide lenses exist in an area on the Buen Futuro prospect consisting of 0.7 by 1.0 kilometer in two different stratigraphic levels. Dr. Biste also determined that the primary sulfide mineralization consists mainly of chalcopyrite, pyrite, and minor amounts of sphalerite and galena. Dr. Biste identified a 45-meter thick chalcocite supergene blanket and a 40-meter thick oxide zone that overlie the primary mineralization. He found that gold is enriched in the oxide and copper in the supergene zone where base metals (such as lead and zinc) are leached out. There has not been any mineral production from the Buen Futuro concession to date.
Although the original reserve report is more than a year old at the present time, we have determined that it is appropriate to continue to report reserves for the Buen Futuro prospect based on all of the facts and circumstances taken into consideration, including the review and confirmation of the report by Dr. Biste during March 2005.
Based on the reserve report and our assessment of the current status of the prospect, increased costs for commencing and then sustaining operations, and other factors that we have determined to be appropriate, we estimated the following at December 31, 2003, which estimates we believe are still accurate:

As used in the preceding table,
proven (or measured) reserves are reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well-established; and
probable (or indicated) reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
The in-place proven and probable oxide gold reserves total 2,528,000 tonnes @ 1.03 g/t gold, giving an in situ metal quantity of 83,715 troy ounces. As stated in the report by Dr. Biste, mining method losses are estimated to be negligible, however, metallurgical testing indicates a 4% recovery loss should be expected, which in any event is extremely low, qualifying the in-place reserves pursuant to Industry Guide 7, and decreasing the number to 80,366 troy ounces recoverable.
The in-place proven and probable supergene copper reserves total 2,162,000 tonnes @ 1.72% copper giving an in situ metal quantity of 37,186 tonnes (82 million pounds) of copper. Again, the mining method losses are estimated to be low compared to actual block ore estimates, however, the metallurgical losses are estimated to be in the range of 13%, qualifying the in-place reserves pursuant to Industry Guide 7, and decreasing the number to 32,352 tonnes (71 million pounds) recoverable.
The Buen Futuro mining concession is located 280 kilometers north of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and 18 kilometers east of the township of Ascension de Guarayos. It consists of a single claim of 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) in size. Golden Eagle also owns six contiguous claims in the area consisting of 55,420 hectares (136,500 acres).
Based on Dr. Biste’s report, Golden Eagle proposes to develop the proven and probable reserves in three open pit mines beginning at 7,733 tonnes per day, and ultimately mining 22,000 tonnes per day of gold ore, copper ore and waste. Golden Eagle expects to recover the gold through cyanide leaching in a CIP circuit, and the copper through leaching and solvent extraction, both metals will then be electro-won, all of which is permissible under Golden Eagle’s anticipated permits.
The initial build out of the gold plant and other infrastructure improvements will require a capital investment of about $10,000,000. Golden Eagle estimates that more than $4,000,000 will be necessary for construction of the copper plant and mining expansion, which we plan to invest from gold production proceeds. At the present time, Golden Eagle does not have the funds necessary to commence the plant construction on the Buen Futuro property, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such funds on reasonable terms. Golden Eagle is considering a number of alternatives to obtain the necessary funding, including entering into a joint venture with an industry partner or other experienced persons who wish to participate in a high-risk mining venture, or seeking other forms of debt or equity capital.
Dr. Biste’s report is based on a number of assumptions, and his conclusions are sensitive to the world market for copper and gold. According to his report, he has assumed a gold price per troy ounce of $360 and a copper price per pound of $0.80. These prices are less than the current prices of approximately $440 per troy ounce of gold and $1.52 per pound of copper.
Among the other assumptions set forth in Dr. Biste’s report are that the geological and economic cutoff grades for gold is 0.2 grams per tonne, and for copper is 0.2%, and continued political and labor stability in Bolivia and the Buen Futuro area.
Based on advice from its counsel in Bolivia, Golden Eagle has received, or reasonably anticipates that it will receive, all required governmental permits for the continuation of exploration and the commencement of development and mining operations on the Buen Futuro prospect. Golden Eagle also believes that it will be able to comply with all requirements it expects to be contained in the governmental permits for environmental protection and worker health and safety.
(iv) Gold Bar mill and plant
On June 18, 2004, we entered into a purchase agreement with Atlas Precious Metals, Inc. (Atlas) for the purchase of the Gold Bar mill and gold recovery plant located 27 miles northeast of Eureka, Nevada. In exchange for the Gold Bar mill and plant we issued to Atlas 30,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $.12 per share based on the closing price of the stock on the closing date or a total purchase price of $3,600,000. Upon raising the necessary capital, we intend to dismantle, ship and re-erect this plant on our Buen Futuro site in eastern Bolivia. We estimate the time to dismantle the plant, transport it to Bolivia and re-erect it on our Buen Futuro claim will be approximately eight months from the time we raise the necessary financing. We estimate the cost to dismantle, ship and re-erect the plant on our Buen Futuro claim to be approximately $3.5 million. Based on the reserves we have estimated and assuming (without assurance) that we will obtain the necessary funding to move the Gold Bar mill and to commence production operations, we anticipate the Gold Bar acquisition and the existing mine plan will allow us to extract 5,900 ounces of gold per month and by the second year of operation more than 4.4 million pounds of copper per month. We believe the Gold Bar acquisition will cut by half the construction time for a gold milling and leaching operation of this size.
Prior to completing the purchase of the Gold Bar mill, we received a fairness opinion prepared by H.E. Dunham & Associates. The opinion from H.E. Dunham & Associates determined the economic fairness of the Gold Bar mill transaction to our shareholders. The reported estimated a replacement value on the Gold Bar mill and plant at $12 million. This report also provided an estimated cost to build a similar-sized new gold and copper recovery plant with its associated new equipment, engineering and construction costs at between $45 million and $50 million in today’s dollars. The report also included three comparable acquisition transactions of similar size and capacity, which were used as comparison to our acquisition of the Gold Bar mill and plant. These included the Carr Fork facility located at Tooele, Utah which sold for $7.0 million and the Quintana facility located at Truth or Consequences, New Mexico which sold for $8.5 million to OK Tedi Mining Company in 1986 dollars; while the 4,000 tpd Paradise Peak Gold Facility located at Gabbs, Nevada is currently on the market for $18 million. The report stated that the “acquisition of the Gold Bar Mill is most beneficial to the Company at a good price.” Finally, H.E. Dunham & Associates expressed the opinion that the “transaction is economically fair to Golden Eagle International, Inc and Atlas and their shareholders.” Atlas offered to sell the Gold Bar plant to us, at what we feel was a discounted price, as a result of its desire to participate in the mining of gold and copper at Buen Futuro. The Gold Bar plant was a perfect fit for our needs and was not at the time processing ore from the Gold Bar mine. As of March 31, 2005, we have accrued a $12,099 property tax liability on the Gold Bar mill and plant, which is not due at this time. We have also accrued an ownership conversion tax in the amount of $7,020, which is 50% of the total tax. The remaining 50% is to be paid by Atlas in accordance with the purchase agreement. We are also aware of a $13,702 past due property tax owed by Atlas on the Gold Bar mill and plant prior to the sale to Golden Eagle. We have been assured by Atlas that it intends to pay its tax obligations, however, there can be no assurance that it will do so. Should Atlas not pay its tax liability, we may have to do so. Failure to obtain the necessary financing to move the mill to Bolivia in 2005 or 2006 may cause us to substantially impair its value on our financial statements. In accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement between Atlas and Golden Eagle, we agreed to move all Gold Bar assets of the property within twelve months from the date of the agreement. Should we fail to remove the assets by this date, Atlas has the right to either allow us to store the assets on site or terminate the agreement and return the purchase price to us. While we believe that Atlas does not intend to terminate the agreement, we cannot guarantee that they will do so. We are currently negotiating with them to extend the date by which the assets must be removed, however we also cannot offer any assurances that we will be successful in reaching an agreement on extension. As a result of the possibility of the termination of the agreement, we have moved the $3,600,000 purchase price from property and equipment to a non operating non current asset section. We have also moved the $3,600,000 that we issued in stock from the additional paid in capital to a mezzanine liability section. If we are able to reach an agreement with Atlas to modify our agreement we will reclassify the $3,600,000 purchase price to property plant and equipment and the corresponding amount to the equity section of the balance sheet. The following pro forma balance sheet indicates how the balance sheet would look if we were to reclassify the $3,600,000 to property and equipment and to equity.
1.
This reflects the increase in property and equipment for the Gold Bar mill and plant, inasmuch as the pro forma financial statements assume that the agreement with Atlas was amended prior to December 31, 2004 to eliminate the option that Atlas may have to terminate the agreement. There is a corresponding reduction in redeemable stock payable, total liabilities.
2.
This reflects an increase in additional paid in capital to reflect the shares issued in settlement for the purchase of the Gold Bar mill and plant ($3,600,000) over the par value included in common stock. This also resulted in an increase in total stockholders equity, as well.
(f) Cobra claim
On December 22, 2003, we completed the acquisition of the Cobra claim, an additional 22,500 acres of prime ground in the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend in eastern Bolivia’s Precambrian Shield. The Cobra claim has proven positive for volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”) deposits containing gold and copper, as well as near-surface gold oxide deposits. Induced polarization (IP) and Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys, as well as scout auger drilling, have yielded positive results in an area extending to the northeast of Golden Eagle’s previous 111,500-acre landholding.
Golden Eagle secured the Cobra claim through a Bolivian mining petition and paid initial claims fees of $10,000. To maintain the property in perpetuity, Golden Eagle must pay annual concession patent fees to the Bolivian government of $9,000.
(g) Office leases
Our executive office in the United States is located at 12401 South 450 East, Suite D1, Salt Lake City, Utah 84020. This suite of offices consists of four executive offices, reception space, filing areas and copy and faxing facilities. We pay $1,920 per month on a one-year, renewable lease that expired in November 2003. We leased the offices on a month-to-month basis for the same rate until December 31, 2004. On January 1, 2005 we entered into a six-month lease for the same office space for $1,920 per month.
During June 2003, the Golden Eagle entered into a two- year office lease in La Paz, Bolivia at $1,700 per month. Rental expense paid for the office was approximately $20,000 per year in 2004, 2003, and 2002. During 2004 we relocated our Bolivian headquarters to Santa Cruz, Bolivia. During July of 2004 we reached an agreement with the landlord of our La Paz office to vacate the property and the lease. We incurred no additional charges as a result of the lease termination. On August 1, 2004 we entered into a lease on a smaller, 186 square meter office in La Paz for $420 per month. This lease runs through July 31, 2005. On July 1, 2004, we also entered into a lease for a 350 square meter office in Santa Cruz, Bolivia for $500 per month. This lease runs through June 30, 2005. Office leases are detailed in the following table.
Golden Eagle’s operating subsidiary, GEII Bolivia, owns the mining and processing equipment which is located on the Cangalli claim under its control, or at its warehouse in El Alto, Bolivia, 15 kilometers from its La Paz offices and in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. This equipment includes heavy earthmoving equipment and general support equipment for the mining industry. In addition, GEII Bolivia owns equipment acquired from UCL, which includes mining equipment, real property in proximity to the Cangalli shaft, as well as the dwellings found thereon, two warehouses, the mine shaft head frame, a mine hoist, assorted pumps, an electric generating set, all electrical installations, an inventory of parts, assorted tools, mine rail and cars, two double-deck shaker screens, and various other pieces of mining equipment. GEII Bolivia also owns various support vehicles and trucks. We believe that all of this equipment and the vehicles are in good condition, suitable for use in our mining operations in Cangalli or Buen Futuro.
