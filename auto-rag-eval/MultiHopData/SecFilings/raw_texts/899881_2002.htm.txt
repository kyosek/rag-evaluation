ITEM 2.
Properties
Industrial Distribution Properties
ProLogis has directly invested in real estate assets that are primarily generic bulk industrial distribution properties. These properties generally have an average office finish level of less than 10%. Due to the costs associated with retrofitting space for new customers that has previously been used for service center operations, ProLogis has acquired properties containing service center space on a very limited basis, generally as part of portfolio acquisitions in which the majority of the properties being acquired were generic distribution properties. In Japan, ProLogis’ distribution properties will generally be multi-level centers, which is common in Japan due to the cost and limited availability of land. ProLogis’ properties are typically used for storage, packaging, assembly, distribution and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. Based on square footage, ProLogis’ properties at December 31, 2002 that are used for bulk distribution comprised 87.5% of its total operating portfolio, properties used for light manufacturing and assembly comprised 10.9% of its total operating portfolio and properties used for other purposes, primarily service centers, was 1.6% of its total operating portfolio.
ProLogis has commitments with certain property funds that require ProLogis to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties to the property fund, subject to certain conditions, to the property fund upon completion. During the period that properties are under development, they are included in the CDFS business segment. Regardless of ProLogis’ intent with respect to a property (i.e., long-term investment or expectation of future contribution or sale), all properties that are classified as operating properties are included in the property operations segment while they are directly owned by ProLogis.
Geographic Distribution
ProLogis has direct ownership of 1,267 distribution properties (operating and under development) in North America, Europe and Japan at December 31, 2002. In North America, properties that are owned directly by ProLogis are located in 37 markets (including two cities that are not target markets) in 22 states and the District of Columbia in the United States and in four markets in Mexico. In Europe, the properties that are owned directly by ProLogis are located in 16 markets in eight countries. In Japan, the properties that are owned directly by ProLogis are located in Tokyo. ProLogis defines its markets based on the concentration of properties in a specific area. A market, as defined by ProLogis, can be a metropolitan area, a city, a subsection of a metropolitan area, a subsection of a city or a region of a state or country. Accordingly, the actual location of each market may not be easily identifiable by the names given by ProLogis. Such markets
are identified below along with the major metropolitan areas or cities located in that market to assist in understanding of the information presented in the tables that follow in Item 2.
The table below illustrates the geographic distribution of ProLogis’ portfolio of directly owned operating properties and properties under development. The table excludes land held for future development. The table includes properties owned by ProLogis and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships, which may not be 100% owned by ProLogis (see “- Real Estate Partnerships”). The table does not include properties that are owned by the property funds or ProLogis’ other unconsolidated investees which are discussed under “- Unconsolidated Investees.”

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of each of the Partnerships are included in ProLogis’ Consolidated Financial Statements and in the preceding real estate tables. The interests of the limited partners are reflected as minority interest in ProLogis’ Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 6 to ProLogis’ Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Generally, pursuant to partnership agreements, ProLogis or a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis is the sole controlling general partner of each of the Partnerships with all management powers over the business and affairs of the Partnership. The limited partners of each Partnership generally do not have the authority to transact business for, or participate in the management decisions of, the Partnerships. The general partner in each of the Partnerships may not, without the written consent of all of the limited partners: (i) take any action that would prevent the Partnership from conducting its business; (ii) possess the property of the partnership; (iii) admit an additional partner; or (iv) subject a limited partner to the liability of a general partner. In each Partnership, ProLogis or its wholly owned subsidiary may not voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership or transfer or assign its interests in the Partnership without the consent of all of the limited partners. The limited partners may freely transfer their partnership units to their affiliates, provided that the transfer does not cause a termination of the Partnership under the Code and does not cause ProLogis to cease to comply with the REIT requirements under the Code. The limited partners in each of the Partnerships are entitled to redeem their partnership units for Common Shares. Additionally, the limited partners are entitled to receive preferential cumulative quarterly distributions per unit equal to the quarterly distributions paid on Common Shares.

ProLogis’ investments in and advances to property funds discussed below under “- Property
Operations” totaled $593.5 million at December 31, 2002. ProLogis’ investments in and advances to the temperature-controlled distribution operating companies totaled $178.4 million at December 31, 2002.

ProLogis’ unconsolidated investees are discussed in Note 4 to ProLogis’ Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. See also “Item 1 - Business - ProLogis’ Operating Segments.”
ProLogis’ investments in unconsolidated investees, other than the property funds, were structured to allow ProLogis to comply with the REIT requirements under the Code. Certain of these investees produce income that is not REIT qualifying income (i.e., not rental income or mortgage interest income). To maintain its qualification as a REIT, ProLogis can collectively invest in these companies in amounts up to 20% of the fair market value of ProLogis’ total assets.
With respect to the property funds, an ownership interest of 50% or less is integral to ProLogis’ business strategy. This business strategy allows ProLogis to realize a portion of the profits from its development activities, earn fees from the property funds, raise private debt and equity capital to fund its future development activities, maintain an ownership interest in its developed properties and maintain relationships with its customers. See “Item 1. Business - ProLogis - Business Strategy.”

The information provided in the table below is for the total entity in which ProLogis has an ownership interest, not ProLogis’ proportionate share of the entity.
