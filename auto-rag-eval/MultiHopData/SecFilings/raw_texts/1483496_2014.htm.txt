Item 2. Properties
Our Properties
Currently, our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Permian Basin, the onshore Gulf Coast of Texas, Southwest New Mexico and Kansas. The Permian Basin covers an area approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific onshore oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States. It is characterized by an extensive production history, mature infrastructure, long reserve life and hydrocarbon potential in multiple producing formations. Our primary operations in the onshore Gulf Coast are in conventional fields that produce primarily from the Wilcox formation in Zapata and Duval Counties of Texas.
The following map shows the locations of our core properties as of June 30, 2014.
Summary of Geographic Areas of Operations
The following table sets forth summary estimated reserve information attributable to our principal geographic areas of operations as of July 1, 2014. The following table includes reserves represented by the 17% of Cross Border not owned by us.
Permian Basin
The following description of our properties in the Permian Basin is presented as of June 30, 2014.
Madera Prospect. The Madera Prospect consists of 2,545 gross (1,132 net) acres in Lea County, New Mexico. Our interests in the Madera Prospect include 7 gross (4.1 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 58.4% and an average net revenue interest of 44.4%. RMR Operating is the operator of the Madera Prospect.
We drilled and completed our first horizontal well, the Madera 24 Federal 2H, on the Madera Prospect in January 2012. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of 9,028 feet and a lateral length of 4,620 feet in the Brushy Canyon reservoir and initially produced at a rate of 1,043 Boe/d, comprised of 86% oil. As of June 30, 2014, the Madera 24 Federal 2H well has produced over 169 MBoe, of which 70% was oil. A portion of the other working interest owners elected not to participate in the drilling and completion of the Madera 24 Federal 2H well. As a result, we increased our ownership to an 81.5% working interest (60.6% net revenue interest). Our ownership will revert to a 23.3% working interest (17.5% net revenue interest) when we recover an amount equal to 300% of the costs to drill and complete the well plus operating costs through that date.
We commenced drilling our second horizontal well in the Madera Prospect, the Madera 24 Federal 3H, on February 6, 2013. This well is located just to the west of the Madera 24 Federal 2H well. We are the operator of the well and own a 32.5% working interest and 24.3% net revenue interest. The initial production rate from the Madera 24 Federal 3H well was 1,491 Boe/d, of which 81% was oil. The well has a total measured depth of 13,570 feet, including a true vertical depth of 9,062 feet and a lateral length of 4,508 feet. Our third horizontal Brushy Canyon well at the Madera Prospect, Madera 19 Federal 4H, was completed in March 2014 and had an initial production rate of 740 Boe/d, of which 86% was oil. The well was drilled to a measured depth of 15,843 feet, including a lateral length of 6,813 feet. We are the operator of the well and have an approximately 84% working interest and 63% net revenue interest. Another long lateral length well, the Madera 25 Federal 2H, in which we have an approximately 30% working interest and 23% net revenue interest, was drilled to measured depth of 15,827 feet, and is awaiting completion. The Madera Prospect contains an additional 5 proved undeveloped well locations (2.5 net) that target the Brushy Canyon reservoir.
As of July 1, 2014, the Madera Prospect had estimated proved reserves of 1,409 MBoe, of which 951 MBoe were proved undeveloped, and had net daily average production for the three months ended June 30, 2014 of 445 Boe/d, of which 62% was oil.
Tom Tom Area. We own oil and natural gas interests in approximately 8,300 gross (6,200 net) acres in the Tom Tom and Tomahawk fields in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico through our ownership of Cross Border. Cross Border is the operator of these leases. The target formation in the area is the San Andres reservoir, which is productive across the trend with the Cato field to the west and the Chaveroo field to the east. There are 66 gross wells (52.3 net) in the acreage, with an average working interest of 79% and an average net revenue interest of 66%. As of July 1, 2014, the Tom Tom area had estimated proved reserves of 448 MBoe, of which 74 MBoe were proved developed non-producing and 290 MBoe were proved undeveloped. The area had net daily average production sold for the three months ended June 30, 2014 of 20 Boe/d, all of which was oil production.
On February 11, 2013, the BLM accepted a remediation plan submitted by Cross Border for its Tom Tom and Tomahawk fields. Pursuant to the remediation plan, Cross Border expects to spend up to $2.1 million during our fiscal 2015 to correct environmental issues on these fields.
We commenced a workover program in May 2013 to re-enter existing wells, clean out the wellbores, open unperforated pay, increase pump efficiency and return inactive wells to production. There are 28 gross wells (21.6 net) that we have identified with additional behind pipe pay, and an additional 21 gross wells (17.3 net) on which we have identified opportunities for acid and fracture stimulation.
Turkey Track Area. We own interests in 2,508 gross acres (687 net) in the Lusk Area in Eddy County, New Mexico through Cross Border. The Turkey Track Area consists of 19 gross (2.2 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 11.7% and an average net revenue interest of 9.4%. The primary targets in the Turkey Track Prospect are the 1st and 2nd Bone Spring reservoirs. The operator of the Turkey Track Prospect is Mewbourne Oil Company. As of July 1, 2014, the Turkey Track Prospect had estimated proved reserves of 579 MBoe, of which 303 MBoe were proved undeveloped, and net daily average production sold for the three months ended June 30, 2014 of 164 Boe/d, of which 64% was oil.

The Shafter Lake Lease is horizontally severed at 4,520 feet and is held by production. We own all rights from the surface of the land to approximately 4,520 feet below the surface of the land. RMR Operating is the operator of the Shafter Lake Lease. There are three proved undeveloped locations on these leases (1.7 net wells) which target the Grayburg and San Andres formations. We hold a 58.1% working interest and a 39.7% net revenue interest in this acreage. As of July 1, 2014, our Shafter Lake Lease had estimated proved reserves of 81 MBoe, all of which were proved undeveloped, and no production.
Pawnee Prospect. We own oil and natural gas interests in 1,255 gross and net acres in the Pawnee Prospect in Lea County, New Mexico. The six gross and net producing wells have an average working interest of 100% and an average net revenue interest of 75%. This acreage targets the Tansill, Yates and Delaware formations. RMR Operating is the operator of the Pawnee Prospect. We drilled two wells on the Pawnee Prospect during fiscal 2012. We completed the Big Brave State #1 well in January 2012 and the Good Chief State #1 well in December 2011, with initial production rates of 52 Boe/d and 28 Boe/d, respectively, consisting of substantially all oil production. Both wells are marginal producers, and we are considering converting the wells to salt water disposal wells. As of July 1, 2014, the Pawnee Prospect had estimated proved reserves of 7 MBoe and had net daily average production sold for the three months ended June 30, 2014 of 4 Boe/d, all of which was oil production.

New Mexico Non-Permian Minerals
Cross Border owns 536,526 gross (268,193 net) mineral acres in Hidalgo, Grant, Sierra, and Socorro Counties, New Mexico. This mineral ownership carries no drilling commitments or leasehold obligations. As of July 1, 2014, this acreage had no proved reserves or production.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we generally conduct a preliminary title examination prior to the acquisition of properties or leasehold interests. Prior to commencement of operations on such acreage, a thorough title examination will usually be conducted and any significant defects will be remedied before proceeding with operations. We believe the title to our properties is good, defensible and customary with practices in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions that we believe do not materially detract from the use of such properties. With respect to our properties of which we are not the record owner, we rely instead on contracts with the owner or operator of the property or assignment of leases, pursuant to which, among other things, we generally have the right to have our interest placed on record.
Our properties are generally subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with our use of these properties. Substantially all of the properties of the Company, Black Rock, RMR Operating and Cross Border are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement.
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves.
(1)Prices used are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period July 2013 through June 2014. For oil volumes, the average NYMEX spot price is $100.27 per Bbl. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price is $4.10 per MMBtu. Prices are adjusted for basis differentials, hydrocarbon quality, and transportation, processing, and gathering fees resulting in an oil price of $92.83 per barrel, natural gas liquids price of $31.36 per barrel, and natural gas price of $5.06 per Mcf. The adjusted oil, NGL and natural gas prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties.
(2)Proved reserves include 100% of the reserve quantities attributable to Cross Border.
The following table sets forth our estimated PV-10 and standardized measure of discounted net cash flows as of July 1, 2014.
(1)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. The closest GAAP measure to PV-10 is the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows. The standardized measure differs from PV-10 because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our standardized measure:
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process.”
At July 1, 2014, our estimated proved reserves were 4.1 MMBoe, consisting of 66% oil, which is an increase of 16% compared to our proved reserves of 3.5 MMBoe at May 31, 2013. During fiscal 2014, we added estimated proved reserves of 0.9 MMBoe through field extensions primarily at our Madera and Turkey Track Prospects, which were offset by production of 0.4 MMBoe and minimal upward revisions in previous estimates.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At July 1, 2014, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 2.0 MMBoe, consisting of 76% oil, as compared to 1.6 MMBoe at May 31, 2013, consisting of 79% oil. During fiscal 2014, we added estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 0.5 MMBoe through field extensions primarily at our Madera and Turkey Track Prospects. We converted 0.1 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves, due to new wells drilled at our Turkey Track Prospect and our other non-operated properties. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, we spent $1.0 million relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves. As of July 1, 2014, estimated future development costs relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves was $40.5 million. All of our currently identified proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be drilled by December 31, 2018.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our July 1, 2014 reserve report was prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), independent petroleum engineers. CG&A estimated 100% of our proved reserves in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE Standards”) and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC.
The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards.
The principal person at CG&A who prepared the reserve report is Mr. Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at CG&A since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055) and has over 27 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 25 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. He is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserve definitions and guidelines.
We have an internal staff of geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team consults regularly with representatives of CG&A. We review with them our properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in their preparation of our reserves estimates. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process, a copy of the reserve report is reviewed with representatives of CG&A and our internal technical staff before we disseminate any of the information. Additionally, our senior management reviews and approves the reserve report and any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves on an annual basis.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. The process also requires assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot be certain that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 18 - Supplemental Information Relating to Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)” to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, CG&A employs technologies consistent with the standards established by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data.
