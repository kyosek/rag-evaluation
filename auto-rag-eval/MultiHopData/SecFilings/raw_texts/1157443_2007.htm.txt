Overview
Tylerstone Ventures Corporation (“Tylerstone”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 24, 1998, with authorized common stock of 25,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001. Tylerstone’s formation and prior operations are as described in the appropriate periodic reports filed by Tylerstone with the United State Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
In the fall of 2006, Tylerstone’s then current management began discussions with the management of a company named nCoat, Inc. These discussions and eventual negotiations considered the possible mutual interest between the parties. Tylerstone was a registered and reporting company that had been completing requirements to be listed on the OTC Bulletin Board and nCoat was an operating company that needed additional capital. A merger was agreed upon whereby Tylerstone would buy nCoat, run that business and change Tylerstone’s name so that nCoat, Inc would be the name of the public entity. In anticipation of the merger of the parties, nCoat, Inc. changed its name to nCoat Automotive Group, Inc. (“nCoat Auto”) to allow Tylerstone to amend its articles of incorporation to change its name to nCoat, Inc. We completed the administrative steps and on February 3, 2007, Tylerstone entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with nCoat Auto for the purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of nCoat Auto, par value $0.001 per share (“nCoat Auto Common Stock”), in exchange for new shares of Tylerstone’s Common Stock.
On February 14, 2007, the parties to the Agreement completed the initial steps contemplated by the Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, nCoat, Inc., which was formerly Tylerstone, acquired 11,554,545 shares of nCoat Auto Common Stock from all of the shareholders of nCoat Auto, which represented 100.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of nCoat Auto Common Stock, in exchange for the issuance of 50,840,000 shares of nCoat, Inc. Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which represents 57% of the then issued and outstanding shares of nCoat, Inc.’s Common Stock. As an integral part of the Agreement, we then undertook the additional fund-raising financing steps as required by the terms of the Agreement.
As used in this report, the terms, “nCoat,” “the Company,” and “the Registrant” means nCoat, Inc., and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, unless the context indicates otherwise. The historical references to nCoat or the Company prior to the February 14, 2007, closing date refers to the historical financial information of the original nCoat, Inc. (nCoat Auto). We also will use the terms “we”, “us” and “our” in order to make the text of this document as readable as possible, only referring to the companies by name to reduce the confusion of similarly named groups.
Background and History of nCoat Auto and its Operating Subsidiaries and Affiliates
We specialize in nanotechnology research, licensing, and the commercialization, distribution and application of nano-formulated, as well as traditional, surface coatings. Our specialized coatings are used by the automotive, diesel engine, trucking, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, aerospace and oil and gas industries for heat management, corrosion resistance, friction reduction, bond strength and appearance. Operations are headquartered in Whitsett, North Carolina, along with our largest production facility. In addition, the Company maintains satellite production facilities in Bluffdale, Utah; Tempe, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Pascagoula, Mississippi; and Quakertown, Pennsylvania. As previously reported by us, we have historically had franchise agreements in France, New Zealand and Australia under which we have sold a minimal volume of its coatings to the franchisees. As of the date of this filing, the franchise agreements in Australia had been terminated either by the expiration of the original term of the franchise agreement or due to the closure of the franchisee’s business. We are currently evaluating restructuring the relationships with the operations in New Zealand and France.
nCoat Auto operated as an unincorporated association from September 25, 2004, until January 2005 when it was incorporated in Delaware under the name and style of NanoCoat, Inc. NanoCoat, Inc. was a development stage enterprise until it completed the acquisition of High Performance Coatings, Inc. (“HPC”) on September 30, 2005. In the fall of 2006, NanoCoat, Inc., in the interest of going forward with branding and other commercial marketing efforts, elected to change its name to nCoat, Inc. and then later to nCoat Automotive Group, Inc. to allow for the nCoat/Tylerstone merger. From September 30, 2005, the date of the HPC acquisition, nCoat has been a fully operating company.
In May 2006, nCoat Auto formed nTech, Inc. (“nTech”), a Delaware corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary, designated to develop and hold proprietary intellectual property for the nCoat Auto group of companies. On June 29, 2007, we acquired all of the common stock of MCC, Inc. (Metallic Ceramic Coatings, Inc., or "MCCI"), a Pennsylvania corporation doing business under the brand name of Jet-Hot®.
Part of our business focuses on nanotechnology research, licensing, and the commercialization, distribution and application of nano-formulated, as well as traditional, surface coatings. Nanotechnology is the branch of science dealing with manipulating, building, and organizing material from extremely small particles, some at the molecular level. These diminutive particles can be combined in new, disruptive materials that have unique properties.
We have developed a business strategy to commercialize these new products, we have focused thus far on our specialized coatings that are used by the automotive, diesel engine, trucking recreational vehicle, motorcycle, aerospace and oil and gas industries for heat management, corrosion resistance, friction reduction, bond strength and appearance.
Since inception, we have focused our resources on the following areas:
1)
Develop proprietary nanotechnology coatings formulations into commercially viable nano-formulated coatings and materials products.
2)
Fund the acquisitions of profitable high performance coating (surface treatment) companies in a highly fragmented cottage industry and to provide operating and expansion capital for growth of those acquisitions.
3)
Exploit the organic growth prospects in HPC, MCCI and in all future acquisitions. (See discussion below.)
4)
Provide a corporate structure for the daily management of all companies, interests, and stock held by nCoat and its subsidiaries, including preparation of all accounting and finance, operations, information, marketing, sales, human resource, management and other systems and process to support transition and integration of an aggressive acquisition strategy.
5)
Create competitive diversification by incorporating a “distributed” production model into the specialty coatings industry that is currently rare in the high performance coatings arena.
6)
Create competitive diversification by incorporating a “licensing” model into our business plans. This licensing will allow us to provide other applicators with our coatings.
7)
Operate nTech, HPC and MCCI and other future acquisitions to develop, integrate and sell commercially viable proprietary nano-formulated and traditional coatings products.
In anticipation of achieving growth through acquisitions and internal growth of existing operating entities, we added facilities, personnel, systems and processes to support business growth and acquisition activities. Details of these expenses are discussed below.
In September 2005, we acquired HPC, a 23-year-old Oklahoma company that has specialized in thermal barrier, corrosion resistant, lubritic and appearance high performance coatings for the motor sports and other industries. Building on these race car roots, we expanded HPC’s market-base beyond coating specialized engines and exhaust systems, to include corporate accounts of manufacturers of commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, defense applications, motorcycles, aerospace components, aviation parts, oil and gas industry suppliers, energy producers and other sophisticated users, while continuing to provide coatings and services to the after-market customer.
On June 29, 2007, we acquired MCCI, a primary competitor of HPC. Management believes that MCCI’s 26-year market share growth and customer base in automotive aftermarket and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) markets could effectively double the revenues of nCoat.
Our management and science advisors, together with HPC’s and MCCI’s management, have determined that many of the coatings produced and used by us could be reformulated and patented into nano-formulated coatings, creating more efficient and effective coatings than currently produced by the industry. nTech has developed trade secret formulations using nano-scale particles to enhance the performance of its coatings. Currently, we have applied for five patents on our newly nano-formulated coatings and processes which are unique and novel to the industry. With the acquisition of MCCI, nCoat’s customer-base of over 9,000 companies and individuals is presently being served by 200 employees.
Our headquarters’ address is 7237 Pace Drive, P.O. Box 38, Whitsett, NC 27377, and our phone number is (336) 447-2000.
Results of Operations
Performance in Third Quarter of 2007 Compared to Third Quarter of 2006
Performance Overview
The quarter to quarter increase in revenue of approximately $1.3 million was attributable to the June 29, 2007 acquisition of MCCI. HPC revenues were slightly less than those in the same period in 2006 and continue to be impacted by changes being implemented by our diesel engine manufacturing customers. According to industry sources, heavy-duty truck sales have fallen 42.5% for the first eight months of 2007. One major truck manufacture reported a 71% decrease in year to year unit sales. Beginning in January 2007, our diesel engine manufacturing customers were required to introduce new engine platforms to meet new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements to lower harmful particulates in engine emissions in order to comply with Federal clean air standards. nCoat sells and applies coatings that aide diesel emissions systems to meet these new standards. Our customers’ introduction of the new engine platform created increased sales of engines manufactured in the 2006 model year prior to introduction of the new 2007 engines.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from 110% in the third quarter of 2006 to 64% for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. With the acquisition of MCCI, we have increased the percentage of our business related to after market products, which typically have a higher margin than our OEM products. Costs in 2006 were inflated due to the use of temporary labor, excessive overtime, high transportation costs and the associated costs related to the ramp up in production.
General and Administrative Expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 increased by approximately $888,000 and decreased as a percentage of sales from 112% to 89% for the same period in 2006. The 2007 general and administrative expenses include costs related to our first year operating as a public company and the associated costs of nCoat, which reflect the costs related to the infrastructure created to support the aggressive acquisition and growth plan for the Company.
Sales and Marketing Expense.
Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2007, increased by approximately $27,000 and decreased to 14% of sales compared to 27% for the same period in 2006. This increase in 2007, when compared to the same period in 2006, is attributable to higher marketing costs at MCCI to promote its aftermarket products.
Interest Expense.
The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of the write-off of all remaining debt discount, deferred loan costs and redemption premium related to acceleration of the maturity date for the Series A and Series B Convertible Notes. In the third quarter of 2007 a total of $15,920,903 was charged to interest related to this acceleration, consisting of $11,909,722 debt discount, $3,062,500 redemption premium and $948,681 of deferred loan coasts..
Earnings per Share.
As a result of the share exchange transaction discussed in the filing, exercise of warrants, conversion of debt the number of outstanding shares have increased to 96,650,451 and the weighted average shares have increased from 33,660,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2006 to 89,496,127 at September 30, 2007.
The Company incurred losses of $18,253,678 and $2,462,397 during the three month periods ended September 30, 2007, and September 30, 2006, respectively.
Performance in the First Nine Months of 2007 Compared to First Nine Months of
Performance Overview
When compared to the nine month period ending September 2006, the year to date increase in revenue of approximately $922,000 is attributable to the acquisition of MCCI on June 29, 2007. Factors impacting our year to year revenue comparisons include the impact of the reduced number diesel engines being produced by our customers and the impact of nonrecurring source of revenue. Revenue in 2006 included approximately $900,000 of nonrecurring revenue from fulfilling a one-time contract for a major motor motorcycle manufacturer that utilized our coatings services while their vendor rebuilt a facility following a fire. After a three year relationship with us, a major OEM Diesel engine manufacturer, which from time to time represented as much as 20% of our revenue, consolidated their manufacturing operations to Europe. Due to this change, the cost of transporting parts to our facility caused the customer to discontinue using our coatings.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared to 87% for the same period in 2006. Although there was improvement in the third quarter, our year-to-date cost of sales continue to be impacted by the higher cost associated with the usual and customary costs related to the start-up of a new facility
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 increased by approximately $3.5 million to 127% of sales compared to 71% for the same period in 2006. The expense for the period reflects the grant of shares of common stock to employees during the first and third quarter and the related expense of $1,222,044. The 2007 increase over the same period in 2006 also reflects costs related to creating and operating a public company and the costs related to the infrastructure created to support the aggressive acquisition and growth plan for the Company
Sales and Marketing Expense
Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, decreased by approximately $250,000 and decreased to 13% of sales compared to 22% for the same period in 2006. This decrease in 2007, when compared to the same period in 2006, is attributable to a major sales campaign which began in the second quarter of 2006. The Company has not conducted a similar campaign in 2007.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by approximately $16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This increase reflects the impact of the write-off of all remaining debt discount, deferred loan costs and redemption premium related to the acceleration of the maturity date for the Series A and Series B Convertible Notes.
Earnings per Share.
As a result of the share exchange transaction, issuance of employee stock, exercise of warrants and conversion of debt, the number of outstanding shares has increased to 96,650,451 and the weighted average shares have increased from 30,484,175 for the six months ended September 30, 2006 to 78,618,770.
The Company incurred losses of $23,440,334 and $4,257,999 and used $3,818,531 and $2,092,546 of cash in operating activities during the periods ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.
Financial Statements, One-Time Charges and Capital Expenditures
We continued to feel the effects of and experience higher costs related to preparing for accelerated growth through acquisitions and organic internal growth of existing operating entities. In 2006, we added facilities, personnel, systems and processes to support business growth and acquisition activities. These expenditures we discussed in the Company’s current report on Form 8K filed on May 18, 2007. Areas where expenditures and one-time expenses impacted the first nine months of 2007 were:
1.
Facilities
a.
We incurred additional expenses related to the opening a facility closer to our customer base in North Carolina, tooling and prototyping for new accounts, aftermarket finishing equipment, staging and cleaning equipment were added.
b.
We transferred additional production of high volume “H Series” and “S Series” OEM accounts from the HPC Utah facility to the North Carolina facility. HPC continued to retool the Utah facility to meet production requirements for high volume “E-Series” production for new customers in the diesel engine trucking industry.
2.
Headquarters Relocation
a.
Corporate headquarters was moved from Utah to North Carolina This relocation began in 2006 and has continued through 2007. Key employees have been relocated to North Carolina and new offices were established at the North Carolina production facilities.
3.
Personnel
a.
The Company hired personnel in 2006 to ramp production, prepare for acquisition, transition and integration and to prepare for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have focused on completion of Standard Operating Procedure documentation, preparation of information systems, accounting, human resource, production, communications, mixing and blending, strategic finance and other systems to accommodate rapid growth from internal and acquisition growth.
4.
Public Company Preparation
a.
In the first quarter of 2007 one-time expenses were incurred in connection with preparation for merger with a publicly traded entity. Additional expenses were taken to close the shell acquisition transaction and affect the merger, prepare for application for public trading, meet SEC requirements, hire trading support entities and launce the public trading of the newly acquired shell. Expenses include:
i.
Legal;
ii.
Accounting, review and audit;
iii.
Contracts with transfer agent;
iv.
Printing and delivery of original stock certificates;
v.
Retention and compensation of investment banking firm; and
vi.
Public filings.
5.
Research and Development
a.
In 2006, research and development expenses nearly double the expected future research and development burden. Over 20% of 2006 revenue was spent to complete initial formulations of nano-formulated coatings, complete testing and commercialize the coatings with multiple customers. Research and Development in 2007 will be focused on further develop of new coatings, exploring the viability of exclusively licensing non proprietary coatings, prototyping and testing new coatings for customer parts and exploring new patents for further coating development
6.
Non-recurring Marketing and Sales Costs
a.
Marketing and sales set-up costs were realized in 2006 to establish systems and process to capture and track data and develop collateral materials and an internet presence for business development. Expenses in 2007 include development of sample materials demonstrating the efficacy of nCoat proprietary coatings, documentation supporting rapid account sigh-up and terms of business and market research to target key prospects.
7.
Financing
a.
The Company realized one-time expenses in 2006 for financing the purchase of HPC. Amortization expenses and note extension fees were included in interest expenses. Expenses in 2007 include fees relating to engaging advisors to assist the Company in future financings and expenses related to creating the strategic relationships necessary to successfully execute the business plan.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
nCoat is a company with limited operating history and experience upon which to base an evaluation of its performance. In September of 2005, we acquired High Performance Coatings, Inc. (“HPC”), an operational coatings company, which was responsible for the majority of our consolidated revenues. In 2006, we formed an intellectual property and development entity, nTech, Inc. (“nTech”), and in June 2007, we acquired all of the common stock of Metallic Ceramic Coatings, Inc. (“MCCI”), a primary competitor of HPC with 26 years of coatings experience and historical revenues similar to HPC.
On April 13, 2007, we converted $2,000,000 of convertible debentures and $67,752 of accrued interest into 4,135,503 shares of our common stock at $0.50 per share. The remaining $500,000 of convertible debentures, along with accrued interest of $18,107, was converted to 1,036,215shares of common stock at $0.50 per share on August 24, 2007.
From May 25, 2007, through July 9, 2007, we issued $9,000,000 of Series A 6% convertible promissory notes (the “Series A Notes”) and warrants to purchase 22,500,000 shares of common stock, exercisable at $1.00 per share through May 31, 2012. The Series A Notes are convertible into common stock at $0.40 per share through May 31, 2010 when the Series A Notes are due. On May 31, 2007, the Company issued $3,250,000 of Series B 6% convertible promissory notes (the “Series B Notes”) and warrants to purchase 8,125,000 shares of common stock at $0.80 per share through May 31, 2010. The Series B Notes are convertible into common stock at $0.40 per share through May 31, 2010 when the Series B Notes are due. The Series A and B private placement offerings included the conversion of $800,000 of advances from investors of which $700,000 had been received prior to March 31, 2007. The Company received $10,618,916 of proceeds from the issuance of the Series A and Series B convertible notes, net of the $700,000 of advances previously recognized and net of cash offering costs of $931,064.
In the final stages of the offering, after we had closed on the purchase of MCCI, a subscribed investor did not fund its portion of offering. Our intended use of proceeds included retirement of debt and related accrued interest of $3,677,286, $5,000,000 for the acquisition of MCCI, payment of significant pre-offering liabilities and establishing a working capital reserve. The retirement of pre-offering liabilities and the working capital portion of the offering did not get raised prior to our contractual obligation to close the offering. This deficiency of the expected $3,500,000 in funding, combined with the seasonal lull in aftermarket and OEM revenues, has caused us to experience a significant liquidity crisis. A number of our vendors have turned our account over to collection agencies and at September 30, 2007, we had accounts payable in excess of $1.5 million over 120 days past due.
At September 30, 2007 we are in technical breech of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the related Series A and B Convertible Notes and Registration Agreement (collectively the “Note Agreement”). This technical breech is due to our failure to respond to SEC comments within 15 days following receipt, failure to have the registration of the underling shares effective within 75 days of the required filing date, failure to pay partial liquidating damages of $90,000 and issuing $200,000 of unauthorized debt.
Although no demand has been made, the Note Agreement provides that in the event of a breech, within the first 12 months following closing, the holders are entitled to demand immediate redemption of all, or any portion of, the face value of the Series A Notes and Series B Notes, along with a 25% redemption premium and setting the note conversion price to the stock value on that date. As a result, the full face value of the Notes and redemption premium are shown on our Balance Sheet as current liabilities at September 30, 2007. In the three month period ending September 30, 2007, we have expensed all remaining debt discount related to the Series A and B Notes, the 25% redemption premium, all remaining deferred loan costs as well as providing for an additional $450,000 of potential liquidating damages until the registration of the underlying securities is completed. The note conversion price has been reset to $0.36 per share.
Replace with language from K
Although there is no assurance that a waiver will be granted, or if granted the changes to the Note Agreement that would be required, we have requested a waiver of these breeches from the note holders. Any changes to the agreement or to accounting treatment described above will be reflected in subsequent periods.
We have been active in our attempt to reduce our losses and conserve cash. We have had a reduction in work force and reduced head count by 40 employees. Following the acquisition of MCCI we consolidated our two Arizona facilities. On August 31, 2007 and September 14, 2007 certain salaried employees elected to defer all or a portion of their salaries totaling $143,473. On November 9, 2007 all salaried employees’ compensation, totaling $89,193, was deferred. We have limited travel and curtailed expenditures. Since September 30, 2007 we have borrowed an additional $440,000 from investors when we correct K this is same language.
The Company’s continued existence and plans for future growth depend on its ability to continue to obtain the capital necessary, either through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments, to operate until the profitability occurs through the generation of increased revenue and cost containment. We will need to continue to raise this capital to fund both the normal operating costs and expansion efforts. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows or obtain the necessary funding, we will be unable to continue as a going concern. As disclosed in the May 17, 2007, report of the independent auditors related to the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Company’s recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Cash used for operating activities was $3,818,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The Company’s working capital deficiency as at September 30, 2007 was $19,260,463 with accumulated losses from the date of inception of $31,826,068.
As discussed above, we have taken, and continue to take, steps that will allow us to continue as a going concern. For example we have entered into a share exchange agreement with Tylerstone in February 2007; have engaged an investment banking firm to assist in raising new capital; have converted existing debt into equity; raised new capital; purchased a major competitor; consolidated facilities; strengthened the management team; increased operating activities focused on marketing our products; and negotiated sales agreements to enable us to generate sufficient cash flow to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, if we do not receive sufficient funds to settle amounts owed to creditors and pay future expenses, there is the possibility that the Company would be unable to continue.
At September 30, 2007, we had assets of $12,023,878 and liabilities of $21,599,500. Amounts owed to related parties have no specific terms of repayment and bear no interest.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases for it production facilities and office space.
