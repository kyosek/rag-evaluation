Oil and Gas Properties - Colombia
In June 2006, we purchased Argosy Energy International L.P (“Argosy”) which was subsequently renamed Gran Tierra Colombia Ltd. Argosy had interests in seven exploration and production contracts at that time, including the Santana, Guayuyaco, Chaza and Mecaya blocks in the Putumayo basin in southwest Colombia; the Talora and Rio Magdalena blocks in the Magdalena basin, west of Bogota; and the Primavera Block in the Llanos basin. The acquisition price included overriding royalty rights and net profits interests in the blocks that were owned by Argosy at the time of the acquisition. The Azar Block in the Putumayo basin was acquired later in 2006, and two Technical Evaluation Areas in the Putumayo basin (Putumayo West A and Putumayo West B) were acquired in 2007. We relinquished the Primavera Block in 2007 and we relinquished the Talora Block in 2009.
In November 2008, we acquired Solana which increased our interest in the Guayuyaco and Chaza blocks, and added 7 blocks in 3 basins. The Magangue Block is located in the Lower Magdalena basin in northwest Colombia; the Catguas Block is in the Catatumbo basin which forms the southwest flank of Venezuela’s Maracaibo basin; and the Guachiria Norte, San Pablo, Guachiria, Guachiria Sur and Garibay blocks are in the Llanos basin north east of Bogota. In 2009, we sold the Guachira, Guachiria Sur and Guachiria Norte blocks and we relinquished our rights to the San Pablo Block.
Page 26 of 113
In 2009, we converted portions of the two Technical Evaluation Areas to three exploration and production blocks - part of Putumayo West A was converted to two exploration and exploitation blocks named Piedemonte Norte and Piedemonte Sur. Part of Putumayo West B was converted to the Rumiyaco Block.
In 2010, we were awarded 3 blocks in Colombia Bid Round 10 which are subject to ANH approval (Cauca 6, Cauca 6 and Putumayo-10). In 2010, we also acquired an operated interest in the Putumayo-1 Block. We currently have interests in 16 blocks in Colombia, and are operator of 15 blocks.
Currently, the Guayuyaco, Santana, Chaza and Garibay blocks have producing oil wells. The Magangue Block has 1 producing gas well.
Colombian royalties are established under law 756 of 2002. All discoveries made subsequent to the enactment of this law have the sliding scale royalty described below. Discoveries made before the enactment of this law have a royalty of 20%. The ANH contracts to which Gran Tierra is a party all have royalties that are based on a sliding scale described in law 756. This royalty works on an individual field basis starting with a base royalty rate of 8% for gross production of less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day. The royalty increases in a linear fashion from 8% to 20% for gross production between 5,000 and 125,000 barrels of oil per day, and is stable at 20% for gross production between 125,000 and 400,000 barrels of oil per day. For gross production between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil per day the rate increases in a linear fashion from 20% to 25%. For gross production in excess of 600,000 barrels of oil per day the royalty rate is fixed at 25%. Our production from the Costayaco field is also subject (starting in October 2009) to an additional royalty that applies when cumulative gross production from a field is greater than 5 million barrels. This additional royalty applies to 30% of the gross production and is calculated on the difference between WTI and an oil quality based index. As the law stands currently, any new discoveries on ANH contracted blocks will also be subject to this additional royalty once each new field exceeds 5 million barrels of cumulative production. The Moqueta discovery in the Chaza Block and the Jilguero discovery in the Garibay Block will both be subject to this additional royalty after each field produces 5 million barrels. The Santana and Magangue blocks have a flat 20% royalty as those discoveries were made before 2002. The Guayuyaco and Rio Magdalena blocks have the sliding scale royalty but do not have the additional royalty. In addition to these government royalties, Gran Tierra’s original interests in the five blocks purchased from Argosy that we still hold (Santana, Guayuyaco, Chaza, Rio Magdalena, Mecaya) are subject to a third party royalty. The additional interest in Guayuyaco and Chaza acquired by Gran Tierra on the acquisition of Solana is not subject to this third party royalty.
Santana Block
The Santana Block contract was signed in July 1987 and covers 1,119 gross acres and includes 14 producing wells in four fields - Linda, Mary, Miraflor and Toroyaco. Activities are governed by terms of a Shared Risk Contract with Ecopetrol, and we are the operator. We hold a 35% working interest in all fields. Ecopetrol holds the remaining interest. The block has been producing since 1991. Under the Shared Risk Contract, Ecopetrol initially backed in to a 50% working interest upon declaration of commerciality in 1991. In June 1996, when the block reached 7 million barrels of oil produced, Ecopetrol had the right to back into a further 15% working interest, which it took, for a total ownership of 65%.
The production contract expires in 2015, at which time the property will be returned to the government. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs.
In 2010, we performed minor facility maintenance. For 2011 there are no capital expenditures planned for Santana.
Guayuyaco Block
The Guayuyaco Block contract was signed in September 2002 and covers 52,366 gross acres, which includes the area surrounding the four producing fields of the Santana contract area. The Guayuyaco Block is governed by an Association Contract with Ecopetrol. We are the operator and have a 70% participation interest, with the other 30% held by Ecopetrol. The Guayuyaco field was discovered in 2005. Two wells are now producing in this field, Guayuyaco-1 commenced production in February 2005 and Guayuyaco-2 began production in September 2005. The Juanambu field, also in the Guayuyaco Block has two producing wells; Juanambu-1 began commercial production on November 8, 2007 and Juanambu-2 began production in March 2010. Ecopetrol has the option to back-in to a 30% participation interest in any other new discoveries in the block.
The contract expires in two phases: the exploration phase and the production phase. The exploration phase expired in 2005 and the production phase expires in 2030. We have completed all of our obligations in relation to the exploration phase of the contract. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs.
In 2010, we drilled Juanambu -2 and we also performed work on electrical systems, flowlines, storage tanks and other production facilities. In 2011, we plan to drill one development well (Juanambu-3) and conduct two exploration 3D seismic programs.

Chaza Block
The Chaza Block covers 80,242 gross acres and is governed by the terms of an Exploration and Exploitation Contract with ANH, which was signed June 27, 2005. We are the operator and hold a 100% participation interest. The discovery of the Costayaco field in the Chaza Block was the result of drilling the Costayaco-1 exploration well in the second quarter of 2007. This well commenced production in July 2007.
This block entered the 6th exploration phase in December 2010 which has a six month duration and an obligation to drill one exploration well. The contract for this field expires in two phases. The exploration phase currently expires in 2011 and the production phase ends in 2033. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production phase. We are planning to apply for an additional exploratory program allowable under our contract which would extend the exploration phase of the contract for an additional four years. Within 60 days following the date of the return of the property, we must carry out an abandonment program to the satisfaction of ANH. In conjunction with the abandonment, we must establish and maintain an abandonment fund to ensure that financial resources are available at the end of the contract.
In 2010, we drilled one successful exploration well, and plugged and abandoned a second exploration well, Dantayaco-1. Pacayaco-1 was suspended while we acquired and interpreted additional seismic and either a new well or a sidetrack of the existing well is planned late in the second quarter of 2011. In the Costayaco field, Costayaco-11 was drilled as a development well and the Costayaco-12 and Costayaco-13 development wells were in progress at year-end. We performed upgrades to the pumping station, battery and support facilities and initiated a project to electrify the field. The electrification will reduce our dependence on diesel fuel for power and lead to cost savings. In the Moqueta field, we drilled three delineation wells, Moqueta-2, 3 and 4 (in progress at year end and testing expected to be completed by March 2011). Two seismic programs were acquired in the Chaza Block; the Rio Guineo 100 square kilometer 3D program and the Moqueta 50 kilometer 2D program.
In 2011, one exploration well is planned for the Chaza Block, Canangucho-1 (spud February 2011), and up to three development wells. One water injector well is planned for the Costayaco field and up to two development wells are planned for the Moqueta field (Moqueta 5 and 6). The remaining facility upgrades in the Costayaco field are planned to be completed in 2011. In addition, the Moqueta pipeline and production facilities are planned to be completed with the expectation of initial production early in the second quarter of 2011. Two seismic acquisition programs are planned for 2011; the Moqueta 120 square kilometer 3D program and the Verdeyaco 3D program.
Azar Block
We acquired an 80% interest in the Azar Block through a farm-in agreement entered into in late 2006. This exploration block covers 47,226 gross acres and we are the operator. Pursuant to the terms of the farm-in agreement we were obligated to pay the original owner’s 20% share of future costs, in addition to our own 80% share. In mid-2007 we farmed out 50% of our interest to a third party. The third party will pay 100% of our 80% share of exploration and development costs for the first three periods of the exploration contract, and we remained obligated to pay 20% of costs under our 2006 farm-in agreement. The agreement has now moved to its next phase, in which the carried partner will pay 50% of its share (10% of the total cost) of the work for the current exploration period to maintain its 20% interest. If the carried partner does not pay its share of the costs, then it will reduce its ownership percentage to 10%. We are now in the fourth exploration period which carries a commitment to drill one well. There are two more exploration periods that follow, each lasting 12 months and including an obligation to drill one exploration well. The exploration phase of the contract expires in 2013 for this property. The exploitation phase expires 24 years after commerciality is approved. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract. If we make a commercial discovery on the block, and produce oil, we will be obligated to perform abandonment activities under the same conditions as those for the Chaza Block.
In 2010, we acquired 75 square kilometers of 3D seismic. In 2011, we plan to drill one exploration well.
Piedemonte Norte Block
In June 2009, we completed the conversion of our Technical Evaluation Areas in the Putumayo Basin to blocks with ANH Exploration and Exploitation Contracts. Piedemonte Norte covers 78,742 gross acres and is held 100% by Gran Tierra and was part of the Putumayo West A Technical Evaluation Area. From June to December 2009 we were in a pre-exploration phase in which we performed environmental evaluation and survey work. The first exploration period expires in June 2011. There are a total of 6 exploration periods and the exploration phase of the contract expires in December 2015. The exploitation phase would expire 24 years after commerciality of a discovery is approved. The first exploration period contains a commitment to acquire, process and interpret 70 kilometers of 2D seismic by June 2011.
In 2010, we acquired 20 kilometers of 2D seismic. In 2011, we plan to acquire 50 kilometers of 2D seismic and drill one stratigraphic well.

The first exploration period contains a commitment to drill one exploration well to a minimum depth of 3,000 feet, by December 16, 2010.
In 2010, we acquired 20 kilometers of 2D seismic and this program extended into 2011. In 2011, we plan to complete the 2D seismic acquisition program and drilling of the first exploration well. Pre-drill operations for this exploratory well, Taruka-1, were in progress at year-end and formal extension of the first phase was requested from the ANH. Taruka-1 was spud in early January 2011 and plugged and abandoned in February 2011.
Rumiyaco Block
Rumiyaco was part of the Putumayo West B Technical Evaluation Area and became an exploration block with an ANH Exploration and Exploitation Contract in June 2009. Rumiyaco covers 82,624 gross acres and is held 100% by Gran Tierra. From June to December 2009, we were in a pre-exploration phase in which we performed environmental evaluation and survey work. We are now in the second exploration period of a total of six periods in the contract. The exploration phase ends in December 2015, and the exploitation phase would expire 24 years after commerciality of a discovery is approved. The second exploration period contains a commitment to drill one exploration by September 2011.
In 2010, we acquired 95 square kilometers of 3D seismic. In 2011, we plan to drill one exploration well (Rumiyaco-1).
Magangué Block
Solana acquired the Magangue Block in October 2006. It is held pursuant to an Ecopetrol Association Contract and covers an area of 20,647 gross acres. We are the operator of the block with a 42% working interest and our partner Ecopetrol has the remaining 58%. This block contains the Güepajé gas field.
This block borders the La Creciente Block where there was a significant gas discovery in the same productive formation as the Güepajé gas field in 2006. The contract expires in 2017. The exploration phase for this block is over and there are no obligatory work commitments.
In 2010, we purchased equipment for hydrocarbon dew point control to meet pipeline specifications. In 2011, we plan to do minor facility upgrades.
Garibay Block
Solana acquired the Garibay Block in October 2005. The block covers 75,936 gross acres and we have a working interest of 50%. The block is located approximately 170 kilometers east of Bogotá and is subject to an ANH contract. On November 17, 2007, a farm-out agreement was signed with a third party under which they financed the drilling of the Topocho-1 exploration well in return for a 50% working interest in the block and becoming the operator. This well was a dry hole.
We are currently in the 6th and final period of the exploration contract, which expires October 24, 2011. There is an obligation to drill one exploration well in the current exploration period.
In 2010, one exploration well was drilled (Jilguero-1), which resulted in an oil discovery. In 2011, we plan to drill one exploration well which will satisfy the exploration obligation.
Rio Magdalena
The Rio Magdalena Association Contract with Ecopetrol was signed in February 2002. The Rio Magdalena Block covers 72,312 gross acres and is located approximately 75 kilometers west of Bogota, Colombia. This is an exploration block and there are no reserves at this time. We are the operator of the block and hold a 44% working interest with one partner holding a 56% working interest. The production contract expires in 2030 at which time the property will be returned to the government. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs. According to the terms of the Association Contract, Ecopetrol may back-in for a 30% participation interest to any discoveries on the block upon commercialization. In 2010 we submitted a proposal to Ecopetrol to relinquish 50% of the area in the block. Our relinquishment proposal was accepted by Ecopetrol.

The Mecaya Exploration and Exploitation contract was signed June 2006. The Mecaya contract area covers 74,128 gross acres in southern Colombia in the Putumayo Basin. We are the operator and currently have a 15% participation interest and three partners with 27%, 28% and 30% interest. We are in exploration period three of this contract and are obliged to drill one exploration well, and re-enter a previously drilled well. We were contractually obligated to complete this work by June 2009; however, the contract terms have been suspended due to operational difficulties in the area. There are two more exploration periods following, each of which are 12 months in duration. The third period has an obligation to acquire seismic data, and the fourth period has the obligation to drill one exploration well. The exploitation phase for this contract expires 24 years after commerciality is approved for any discovery. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract.
In 2010, there were no capital expenditures and no capital expenditures are planned for 2011.

Oil and Gas Properties - Argentina
In September 2005, we entered Argentina through the acquisition of a 14% interest in the Palmar Largo joint venture, and a 50% interest in each of the Nacatimbay and Ipaguazu blocks. In 2006, we purchased additional properties in Argentina, including the remaining 50% interest in Nacatimbay and Ipaguazu, a 50% interest in El Vinalar, a 100% interest in El Chivil, Surubi and Santa Victoria, and a 93.18% interest in Valle Morado. In 2009 we relinquished our rights to the Nacatimbay Block and in 2011 we plan to relinquish our interest in the Ipaguazu Block. Our Argentina properties are located in the Noroeste Basin in northern Argentina.
Palmar Largo
The Palmar Largo joint venture block encompasses 341,500 gross acres. This asset is comprised of several producing oil fields in the Noroeste Basin. We own a 14% working interest in the Palmar Largo joint venture, which we purchased in September 2005. A total of 14 gross wells are currently producing.
The Palmar Largo Block rights expire in 2017 but provide for a ten-year extension. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. On expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government.
In 2010, only regular field maintenance and workover activities were performed at Palmar Largo. In 2011, only regular field maintenance and workover activities are planned.
Ipaguazu
We acquired a 100% working interest in the Ipaguazu Block through two transactions. We purchased a 50% working interest in September 2005 and we purchased the remaining 50% working interest in November 2006. We are the operator of the block. The oil and gas field was discovered in 1981 and produced approximately 100 thousand barrels of oil and 400 million cubic feet of natural gas until 2003. The Ipaguazu Block covers 21,745 gross acres. The Ipaguazu Block rights expire in 2016 with a ten year extension if a discovery is made. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government In April 2010, production operations at the Ipaguazu-1 well were suspended due to low well productivity. We filed an application for relinquishment of the Ipaguazu Block in 2010 and are awaiting government approval.
El Vinalar
In June 2006, we acquired a 50% working interest in the El Vinalar Block, which covers 61,035 gross acres.
The El Vinalar rights expire in 2016 with a ten year extension if a discovery is made. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government.
In 2010, we performed regular field maintenance and workovers in El Vinalar. Only regular field maintenance and workover activities are planned in 2011.
El Chivil
We purchased El Chivil in 2006. We are the operator and hold a 100% working interest in El Chivil which covers 30,393 gross acres. The Chivil field was discovered in 1987. Three wells were drilled with two remaining in production. The contract for this field expires in 2015 with the option for a ten year extension.
In 2010, we performed regular field maintenance and workovers in El Chivil. Only regular field maintenance and workover activities are planned in 2011.
Surubi
We purchased the Surubi Block in late 2006. We are the operator of the Surubi Block which covers 90,811 gross acres and have an 85% working interest. In 2008, we drilled the Proa-1 discovery well, which began production in September, 2008. The provincial oil company REFSA farmed-in to the block for a 15% working interest, and is paying its share of well costs from its share of production from Proa-1. The contract for this block expires in 2023 and we have no outstanding commitments related to the block contract.
Page 31 of 113
In 2010, we performed regular maintenance and workover activities at Proa-1. For 2011, we plan to drill a development well (Proa-2) in addition to performing regular maintenance and workover activities.
Valle Morado
We purchased the Valle Morado Block at the end of 2006. Valle Morado covers 49,099 gross acres and we are the operator with a 93.2% working interest. The remaining 6.8% interest is held equally by two other companies. The previous owners had the option to back-in for an 18% working interest under certain circumstances; however, we paid out the owners and eliminated this option during 2010. The contract for this block expires in 2034 and we have no outstanding commitments related to the block contract.
Valle Morado GTE.St.VMor-2001 was first drilled in 1989. The original owner subsequently completed a 3D seismic program over the field and constructed a gas plant and pipeline infrastructure. Production began in 1999 from the GTE.St.VMor-2001 and was shut-in in 2001 due to water incursion. In 2008, we successfully re-entered the well.
In July 2010, we commenced a re-entry and sidetrack operation on the GTE.St.VMor-2001 well. In February 2011, these operations were suspended and the wellbore will be abandoned due to a number of operational challenges encountered. Gran Tierra Energy continues to review alternatives associated with the field development.
Santa Victoria
We purchased the Santa Victoria Block late in 2006. Santa Victoria covers 1,033,889 gross acres and we are the operator with a 100% working interest. It is an exploration block with no production history. The contract’s exploration period expired in December 2010 however we received a 90 day extension to March 29, 2011. We are using the extension to allow for the interpretation of the 202 square kilometers of 3D seismic acquired in 2010 and determine whether to proceed into the next phase of the contract. We have no other outstanding commitments related to the block contract.
Oil and Gas Properties - Peru
We entered Peru in 2006 through the award by the government of Peru of two frontier exploration blocks, Block 122 and Block 128, in the Maranon Basin. In September 2010, we acquired a 20% non-operated working interest in three blocks in the Maranon Basin. These three blocks, Block 123, Block 124, and Block 129 are adjacent to Block 122 and Block 128. In December 2010, we further increased our acreage position in the Maranon Basin in Peru by acquiring a 60% working interest in Block 95. The acquisition in 2010 of these four blocks is subject to approval by the Government of Peru.
There is a 5-20%, sliding scale, royalty rate on the lands, dependent on production levels. Production less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day is assessed a royalty of 5%, for production between 5,000 and 100,000 barrels of oil per day there is a linear sliding scale between 5% and 20%. Production over 100,000 barrels per day has a royalty of 20%. This royalty structure applies to all 6 blocks in Peru that we have an interest in.
Block 122 and Block 128
We were awarded two exploration blocks in Peru in the last quarter of 2006 under a license contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. Block 122 covers 1,217,651 gross acres and Block 128 covers 2,218,389 gross acres. In February 2011, we relinquished 20%, or 443,678 gross acres in Block 128. The blocks are located in the eastern flank of the Maranon Basin in northern Peru, on the crest of the Iquitos Arch. There is a financial commitment of $3.5 million over the seven years for each block which includes technical studies, seismic acquisition and the drilling of exploration wells. We are currently in the second phase of each of these block’s contracts. In 2010, we received EIA approvals for seismic and drilling operations for these blocks and acquired 260 kilometers of 2D seismic on Block 128. At year end, the 290 kilometer 2D seismic acquisition was ongoing at Block 122. Exploration wells are planned for Block 128 (spud February 2011) and for Block 122 in the third quarter of 2011. Up to two more exploration wells are contingent upon the results of these wells.
Block 123, Block 124 and Block 129
In September 2010, we acquired a 20% working interest in Block 123, Block 124, and Block 129, subject to government approval. These three blocks have a total area of approximately 6.7 million acres and Burlington Resources Peru Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips) is the operator of these blocks. We are currently in the second phase of each of the contracts which require seismic acquisition totaling 1,400 kilometers for all blocks prior to phase completion. In 2010, 747 kilometers of 2D seismic was acquired on these blocks. In 2011, we plan to complete the seismic commitments required under phase two for Blocks 123 and Block 129. We may request an extension of phase two in Block 124 to facilitate completion of the seismic commitment for that block.

Block 95
In December 2010, we acquired a 60% working interest in Block 95, subject to government approval. Block 95 has a total area of 1.3 million gross acres. We will be the operator of Block 95. We are currently in phase three of the contract which has been delayed as a result of force majeure. Once force majeure has ended, we plan to apply to extend the current phase to provide sufficient time to complete the well commitment. Block 95 contains a drill ready prospect which we plan to drill in 2011.
Oil and Gas Properties - Brazil
Gran Tierra entered Brazil in 2009 with the opening of a business development office. In August 2010, we acquired a 70% working interest in four exploration blocks in the Reconcavo Basin, subject to government approval.
Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155, and REC-T-224
Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155 and REC-T-224 are located approximately 70 kilometers Northeast of Salvador, Brazil in the prolific Reconcavo Basin. This basin covers an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers, contains 129 fields, and has produced over 1.5 billion barrels of oil to date (source: IHS Inc., 2010). Production from this basin is mainly light oil ranging between 35 and 40 API. These four blocks have a total area of 27,075 gross acres. Gran Tierra is awaiting regulatory approval from Brazil’s ANP to recognize Gran Tierra as the operator of these exploration blocks. All of our blocks in Brazil are subject to an 11% royalty, which consists of a 10% crown royalty and a 1% landowner royalty which applies to onshore blocks. All four blocks are in phase one of the contracts which expire March 12, 2011. An application for a six month extension has been made for Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, and REC-T-224. The first phase for each of Blocks REC-T-129 and REC-T-142 requires the drilling of an exploratory well and, for Block REC-T-224,14 requires the acquisition of 35 square kilometers of 3D seismic. There is no remaining phase one commitment for Block REC-T-155.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2010, 93 square kilometers of 3D seismic was acquired over Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142 and REC-T-155. An additional 35 square kilometers of 3D seismic survey is planned for the first quarter of 2011 for Block REC-T-224. The 1-ALV-2-BA well on Block REC T-155 is presently producing approximately 500 BOPD gross (350 BOPD net after royalties). We plan to dual complete this well in the first quarter of 2011 and plan to drill two appraisal wells to further develop this discovery. In 2011, we plan to drill four exploration wells on Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142 and REC-T-155. The drilling of these wells meets or exceeds each blocks’ phase one commitments. Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, and REC-T-224 will require an additional exploration well to satisfy the phase two commitments and these are planned for 2012. In January 2011, Gran Tierra opened an office in Salvador, Brazil to manage the field operations for the Reconcavo Basin blocks.
Reserves
No estimates of reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in a report to any federal agency other than the SEC.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. As a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and evaluating reserves, and 100% of our reserves are audited by an independent reservoir engineering firm, GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd., at least annually. The reserve estimation process requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. Therefore the accuracy of the reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of the data, the accuracy of the assumptions based on the data, and the interpretations and judgment related to the data.
The policies we have developed are applied company wide, and are comprehensive in nature. The result of the policies is SEC compliant reserve estimates and disclosures. The policy is applied by all staff involved in generating and reporting reserve estimates including geological, engineering and finance personnel. Calculations and data are reviewed at multiple levels of the organization to ensure consistent and appropriate standards and procedures.
The primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates is the Manager of Reservoir Engineering. He has a bachelor’s degree of science in petroleum engineering and is a professional engineer and member of the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta. He is currently responsible for our engineering activities including reserves reporting, asset evaluation, field development and monitoring production operations. He has over 30 years of industry experience in various domestic and international engineering and management roles.

The technical person responsible for overseeing the reserves evaluation is Vice President, International of GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. He has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Physics and is a registered professional engineer in the Province of Alberta. He has over 20 years of industry experience in various domestic and international engineering and management roles.
The SEC definitions related to oil and natural gas reserves, per Regulation S-X, reflecting our use of deterministic reserve estimation methods, are as follows:
•
Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
•
Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i)
The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
A.
The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and
B.
Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii)
In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii)
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
(iv)
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
A.
Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and.
B.
The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
(v)
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
•
Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
(i)
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates.
(ii)
Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
(iii)
Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
(iv)
See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of section 210.4-10(a) of Regulations S-X.

•
Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
(i)
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates.
(ii)
Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project.
(iii)
Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
(iv)
The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects.
(v)
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
(vi)
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of section 210.4-10(a) of Regulations S-X, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations.
•
Reasonable Certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical and geochemical), engineering and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant that to decrease.
•
Deterministic estimate. The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure.
•
Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i)
Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii)
Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
•
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i)
Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii)
Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
(iii)
Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of section 201.4-10(a) of Regulation S-X, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

The following table sets forth our oil reserves net of all royalties as of December 31, 2010 (all quantities in thousands of barrels of oil, “mbbls”, or millions of cubic feet of natural gas, “Mmcf”). Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. When deterministic methods are used, as they are in our case, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
*Liquids include oil and Natural Gas Liquids. We have Natural Gas Liquids reserves in small amounts in Argentina only. Colombia Liquids reserves are 100% oil.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
In Colombia, our proved undeveloped reserves increased to 4.0 million barrels (“Mmbbls”) at December 31, 2010 from 0.6 Mmbbls at December 31, 2009. Approximately 70% of these proved undeveloped reserves are located in our Costayaco field, under development in 2011. Approximately 30% of the proved undeveloped reserves are located in our Moqueta discovery, which will be developed in 2011. Our proved undeveloped reserves in Argentina decreased slightly from 211,000 barrels at December 31, 2009 to 173,000 barrels at December 31, 2010 due to a revision to forecast development activity. We expect to develop these reserves in 2011.
Page 36 of 113
Sensitivity of Reserves to Prices by Principal Product Type and Price Scenario
(1) The total proved Liquids is higher as a result of a 10% decrease in WTI as compared to a 10% increase in WTI. The lower price results in reduced additional government and third party royalties paid, increasing the net after royalty volumes.
The price cases presented involve changes to the WTI price - one with a 10% increase, the second with a 10% decrease. Natural gas prices are not affected by WTI, therefore the volumes of natural gas reserves do not change. Additionally, the oil price in Argentina is set by the government as described in Item “1 Business” under the caption “Markets and Customers”. The price in Argentina is not sensitive to changes in the WTI price, therefore the price scenarios considered do not result in changes to oil and natural gas reserves for Argentina. Cost schedules were held constant for the two price cases.
Production Revenue and Price History
Certain information concerning oil and natural gas production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2010 is set forth in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in the Unaudited Supplementary Data provided following our Financial Statements in Item 8. We prepared the estimate of standardized measure of proved reserves in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 932, “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas”.
Drilling Activities
The following table summarizes the results of our development and exploration drilling activity for the past three years. Wells labeled as “In Progress” were in progress as of December 31, 2010.
