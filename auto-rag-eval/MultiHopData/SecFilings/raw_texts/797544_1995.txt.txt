ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
The Partnership owns all of its properties through a joint venture (the "Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture") formed on March 1, 1988, between the Partnership and Wells Real Estate Fund II-OW ("Wells Fund II-OW"). Wells Fund II-OW is a Georgia public limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund II-OW are substantially identical to those of the Partnership. As of December 31, 1995, the Partnership's equity interest in the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture was approximately 95%, and the equity interest of Wells Fund II-OW was approximately 5%. The Partnership does not have control over the operations of the joint venture; however, it does exercise significant influence. Accordingly, investment in joint venture is recorded on the equity method.

The following describes the properties in which the Partnership owns an interest as of December 31, 1995:
The Charlotte Property
On May 9, 1988, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture acquired a two-story building containing approximately 70,752 net leasable square feet, located on a 9.54 acre tract of land located in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (the "Charlotte Property") for a purchase price of $8,550,000.
While the entire project was originally leased under a net lease to IBM, IBM elected not to exercise its second three year option to extend its lease and vacated the building effective September 30, 1993, after paying a $425,000 lease termination fee.
On May 1, 1994, First Union Bank assumed occupancy of the Charlotte property under a lease which expires April 30, 2001. The principal terms of the lease provide for First Union's sole tenancy of the project as a regional operations center for the initial term of seven years. Because First Union Bank invested approximately $1 million on tenant improvements at the Charlotte property, a lower rental rate was accepted for the first five years. There are presently no plans for improvement or further development of the project.
The annual base rent during the initial term is $412,705 payable in equal monthly installments of $34,392.08 during the first two years, annual base rent of $454,651 payable in equal monthly installments of $37,887.58 during the third year, annual base rent of $489,650 payable in equal monthly installments of $40,804.17 during the fourth year and annual base rent of $524,625 payable in equal monthly installments of $43,718.75 during the fifth year. Rental rates during the remaining two years of the lease term will be determined by market rates.
The occupancy rates at the Charlotte Property as of December 31 were 100% in 1995, 100% in 1994, 0% in 1993, 100% in 1992 and 1991.
The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Charlotte Property was $5.83 for 1995, $3.88 1994, $28.12 for 1993 and $15.69 for 1992, and 1991. The higher effective annual rental rate for 1993 is due to the payment of $425,000 in lease termination fees by IBM.
The Atrium
On April 3, 1989, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture formed a joint venture (the "Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture") with Wells Real Estate Fund III, L.P. ("Wells Fund III"), a public Georgia limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund III are substantially identical to those of the Partnership.
In April 1989, the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture acquired a four- story office building located on a 5.6 acre tract of land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center in metropolitan Houston, in the City of Nassau Bay, Harris County, Texas, know as "The Atrium at Nassau Bay", (the "Atrium").
The funds used by the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture to acquire the Atrium were derived from capital contributions made to the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture by the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund III in the amounts of $8,327,856 and $2,538,000, respectively, for total initial capital contributions of $10,865,856. As of December 31, 1995, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund III had made total capital contributions to the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture of approximately $8,330,000 and $4,448,000, respectively, for the acquisition and development of the Atrium. The Fund II - Fund II- OW Joint Venture holds approximately 66% equity interest in the Fund II - Fund III Joint Venture, and Wells Funds III holds approximately 34% equity interest in the Fund II - Fund III Joint Venture.
The Atrium was first occupied in 1987 and contains approximately 119,000 net leasable square feet. Each floor of the Atrium is currently under a separate lease to Lockheed Engineering and Science Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lockheed Company, each of which leases have terms of approximately eight years and expire June 30, 1996. The leases do not contain any provisions for extension. The Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture is responsible for operating expenses of up to $4.50 per square foot for the first four years and $4.75 per square foot for the remaining term. The tenant under each lease is required to pay certain operating expenses including expenses relating to its share of the building in excess of $4.50 per square foot for the first four lease years and $4.75 per square foot for the remaining term. Under the terms of each of the leases, the tenant is responsible for all maintenance and repair work, as well as all utilities, taxes, insurance and similar expenses with respect to the Atrium in excess of the amounts specified above. The leases for each of the four floors of the building are identical, except as to their base monthly rentals. The leases for the Atrium currently provide for base rent of $185,298 per month until expiration of said leases in June 1996.
The occupancy rate at the Atrium Property was 100%, and the average effective annual rental square foot at the Atrium Property was $17.47 for each of the five years from 1991 through 1995.
The lease with Lockheed will expire June 30, 1996, and renewal is not anticipated at this time. The Partnership has responded to various potential tenants regarding leasing portions of the Atrium, should Lockheed not renew. In the event that Lockheed does not renew its lease and the Partnership is unable to lease a substantial portion of the Atrium Property at rates at least comparable to the lease rates currently being paid under the Lockheed lease, the income generated from the Atrium Property could decrease significantly following the expiration of the Lockheed lease on June 30, 1996. In addition, even if the Partnership is able to obtain leases with new tenants for the Lockheed Project, such leases are likely to require substantial tenant finish and refurbishment expenditures by the Partnership, which could have the effect of substantially reducing future cash distributions to Limited Partners.
The Brookwood Grill Property
On January 31, 1990, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture acquired a 5.8 acre tract of undeveloped real property at the intersection of Warsaw Road and Holcomb Bridge Road in Roswell, Fulton County, Georgia (the "Brookwood Grill Property"). The Brookwood Grill Property is located about two miles west of Georgia Highway 400 and approximately 20 radial miles north of the Atlanta Central Business District. The Fund II - Fund II-OW Joint Venture paid $1,848,561, including acquisition expenses, for the 5.8 acre tract of undeveloped property.
On September 20, 1991, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture contributed the Brookwood Grill, along with its interest as landlord under the lease agreement referred to below, as a capital contribution to the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture. As of September 20, 1991, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture had expended approximately $2,128,000 for the land acquisition and development of the Brookwood Grill Property.
As of September 20, 1991, a lease agreement was entered into with the Brookwood Grill of Roswell, Inc. for the development of approximately 1.5 acres and the construction of a 7,440 square foot restaurant. This Roswell site, which opened early March 1992, is the second location in the Atlanta area for what is anticipated as a southeastern chain of restaurants similar in concept to Houston's, Ruby Tuesday, and Friday's. This chain is principally owned by David Rowe, an Atlanta real estate developer of Kroger shopping centers, and several operating partners formerly with Houston's. The terms of the lease call for an initial term of 9 years and 11 months, with two additional year option periods. The agreement calls for a base rental of $217,006 per year for Years 1 through 5, with a 15% increase over the remainder of the initial term. Rental rates for all option periods will be based on the prevailing market values and rates for those periods. Under the terms of the lease, the Fund II- Fund III Joint Venture was required to make certain improvements for the development and construction of the restaurant building together with parking areas, driveways, landscaping and other improvements described in the plans and specifications. The Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture has expended approximately $1,100,000 for such improvements. In addition to the base rent described above, the tenant is required to pay "additional rent" in amounts equal to a 12% per annum return on all amounts expended for such improvements.
The occupancy rate for the Brookwood Grill, a sole tenant, was 100% for 1995, 1994, 1993 and 1992. The average effective rental per square foot at the Brookwood Grill is $30.21 for 1995, and 1993, and $24.60 for 1992, the first year of occupancy.
As of December 31, 1995, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund III had made total contributions to the Fund II- Fund III Joint Venture of approximately $2,128,000 and $1,330,000, respectively, for the acquisition and development of the Brookwood Grill. The Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture holds an approximately 62% equity interest in the Brookwood Grill property, and Wells Fund III holds an approximately 38% equity interest in the project.
On January 10, 1995, the remaining 4.3 undeveloped acres of land comprising the 880 Property was contributed to a new joint venture, Fund II, III, VI, and VII Associates by Fund II- Fund III Joint Venture. This property is described below.
Fund II, III, VI and VII Joint Venture/Holcomb Bridge Road Project
On January 10, 1995, Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture; Wells Real Estate Fund VI, L.P. ("Wells Fund VI"), a Georgia public limited partnership having Leo F. Wells, III and Wells Partners, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership, as general partners, and Wells Real Estate Fund VII, L. P.("Wells Fund VII"), a Georgia public limited partnership having Leo F. Wells, III and Wells Partners, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership, as general partners, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement known as Fund II, III, VI and VII Associates ("Fund II, III, VI and VII Joint Venture"). Wells Partners, L.P. is a private limited partnership having Wells Capital, Inc., a General Partner of the Partnership, as its sole general partner. The investment objectives of Wells Fund VI and Wells Fund VII are substantially identical to those of the Partnership.
The Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture contributed approximately 4.3 acres of land at the intersection of Warsaw Road and Holcomb Bridge Road in Roswell, Fulton County, Georgia including land improvements with a book value of $1,729,116 to the Fund II, III, VI and VII Joint Venture. Development is underway on two buildings containing a total of approximately 48,000 square feet; 26,000 square feet to be developed as office space and 22,000 square feet to be developed as retail space. As of December 31, 1995, leases have been signed with Bertucci's Restaurant Corporation for 5,935 square feet, Air Touch Cellular for 3,046 square feet and Townsend Tax for 1,389 square feet. Initial occupancy occurred February, 1996.
As of December 31, 1995, Fund II and Fund III Joint Venture had contributed $1,729,116 in land and improvements for an approximate 33% equity interest, Wells Fund VI had contributed $982,691 toward the construction for an approximate 19% equity interest, and Wells Fund VII had contributed $2,500,000 for a approximate 48% equity interest. As of December 31, 1995, the Partnership held an approximate 19% equity interest through the Fund II-II-OW Joint Venture in the Fund II, III, VI and VII Joint Venture. The total cost to develop the Holcomb Bridge Road Project excluding land, is currently estimated to be approximately $4,000,000, and it is anticipated that the remaining approximate $517,000 will be contributed $260,000 by Wells Fund VI and $257,000 by Wells Fund VII.
Tucker Property
The Tucker Property consists of a retail shopping center and a commercial office building complex located in Tucker, DeKalb County, Georgia (the "Tucker Property"). The retail shopping center at the Tucker Project contains approximately 29,858 net leasable square feet. The commercial office space at the Tucker Project, which divided into seven separate buildings, contains approximately 67,465 net leasable square feet.
On January 9, 1987, the Partnership acquired an interest in the Tucker Property which was acquired by a joint venture (the "Tucker Joint Venture") originally between the Partnership and Wells Real Estate Fund I (`Wells Fund I"). Wells Fund I is a Georgia public limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund I are substantially identical to those of the Partnership. Upon the formation of the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture in March 1988, the Partnership contributed its joint venture interest in the Tucker Joint Venture to the Fund II- Fund II-OW Joint Venture as a part of its capital contribution. On January 1, 1991, the Cherokee Joint Venture, which is defined below, was merged into the Tucker Joint Venture forming a new joint venture (the "Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture"). As described below, the Cherokee Joint Venture was also a joint venture between the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund I. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement of Fund I and Fund II Tucker-Cherokee, the percentage interest of the Fund II - Fund II-OW Joint Venture in the Tucker Project remained unchanged as a result of the merger of the Tucker Joint Venture into the Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture.
On August 1, 1995, Wells Fund I and the Fund II-Fund-II-OW Joint Venture entered into another amendment to effect the contribution of the Cherokee Project to the Fund I, II, II-OW, VI, VII Joint Venture, as described below. As a result, the name of the joint venture was changed back to "Fund I and Fund II Tucker", and is therefore no longer merged with the Cherokee Joint Venture. The Partnership's percentage interest in the Tucker Project remained unchanged as a result of the transaction.
Both Wells Fund I and the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture have funded the cost of completing the Tucker Property through capital contributions which have been paid as progressive stages of construction were completed. As of December 31, 1995, Wells Fund I had contributed a total of $6,399,854, and the Fund II- Fund II- OW Joint Venture had contributed a total of $4,826,015 to the Tucker Project and the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture had an approximately 45% equity interest in the Tucker Project. As of December 31, 1995, Wells Fund I had an approximately 55% equity interest in the Tucker Project and the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture had an approximately 45% equity interest in the Tucker Project. As of December 31, 1995, the Tucker Project was 83% occupied by 34 tenants.
There are no tenants in the project occupying ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. The principal businesses, occupations, and professions carried on in the building are typical retail shopping/commercial office services.
The occupancy rate at the Tucker Property was 83% in 1995, 96% in 1994, 89% in 1993, 80% in 1992 and 83% in 1991.
The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Tucker Property was $12.61 for 1995, $12.63 for 1994, $11.37 for 1993, $11.37 for 1992, and $9.77 for 1991.
Cherokee Property
The Cherokee Property consists of a retail shopping center known as "Cherokee Commons Shopping Center" located in metropolitan Atlanta, Cherokee County, Georgia (the "Cherokee Project"). The Cherokee Project consists of approximately 103,755 net leasable square feet.
On June 30, 1987, the Partnership acquired an interest in the Cherokee Project through a joint venture (the "Cherokee Joint Venture") between the Partnership and Wells Fund II-Fund II-OW. On January 1, 1991, the Cherokee Joint Venture merged with the Tucker Joint Venture to form the Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture. As described above, the Tucker Joint Venture was also a joint venture between the Partnership and the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement of Fund I and Fund II Tucker-Cherokee, the Partnership's percentage interest in the Cherokee Project remained unchanged as a result of the merger of the Cherokee Joint Venture into the Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture.
On August 1, 1995, the Partnership, the Fund II - Fund II-OW Joint Venture, Wells Real Estate Fund VI, L.P. ("Wells Fund VI"), a Georgia public limited partnership having Leo F. Wells, III and Wells Partners, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership, as general partners and Wells Real Estate Fund VII, L.P. ("Wells Fund VII"), a Georgia public limited partnership having Leo F. Wells, III and Wells Partners, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership, as general partners entered into a joint venture agreement known as Fund I, II, II-OW, VI, and VII Associates (the "Fund I, II, II-OW, VI, VII Joint Venture"), which was formed to own and operate the Cherokee Project. Wells Partners, L. P. is a private limited partnership having Wells Capital, Inc., a General Partnership, as its sole general partner. The investment objectives of Wells Fund I, Wells Fund II-Fund II-OW, Wells Fund VI and Wells Fund VII are substantially identical to those of the Partnership.
As of December 31, 1995, Wells Fund I had contributed property with a book value of $2,139,900, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture had contributed property with a book value of $4,860,100, Wells Fund VI had contributed cash in the amount of $953,718 and Wells Fund VII had contributed cash in the amount of $953,798 to the Cherokee Project. As of December 31, 1995, the equity interests in the Cherokee Project were as follows: Wells Fund I 23%, Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture 55%, Wells Fund VI 11% and Wells Fund VII 11%. The Cherokee Project is anchored by a 67,115 square foot lease with Kroger Food/Drug which expires in 2011. Kroger's original lease was for 45,528 square feet. In 1994, Kroger expanded to the current 67,115 square feet which is approximately 65% of the total rentable square feet in the property. As of December 31, 1995, the Cherokee Project was approximately 94% occupied by 19 tenants, including Kroger.
Kroger is the only tenant occupying ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. Kroger is a retail grocery chain. The other tenants in the shopping center provide typical retail shopping services.
The Kroger lease calls for an annual rent of $392,915 which increased to $589,102 on August 16, 1995 due to the expansion from 45,528 square feet to 67,115 square feet. The lease expires March 31, 2011 with Kroger entitled to five successive renewals each for a term of five years.
The occupancy rate at the Cherokee Property was 94% in 1995, 91% in 1994, 89% in 1993, 88% in 1992 and 85% in 1991.
The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Cherokee Property was $7.50 for 1995, $5.33 for 1994, $6.47 for 1993, $6.46 for 1992 and $6.52 for 1991.
