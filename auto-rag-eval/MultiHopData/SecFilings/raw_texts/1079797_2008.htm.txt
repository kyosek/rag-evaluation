ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
OFFICE SPACE
In April 2008 we entered into a lease with 1770 St. James Limited Partnership for new office space for our corporate office (the “St. James Lease”). The lease encompasses approximately 3,697 square feet of office space. The St. James Lease commences on June 1, 2008 and ends on May 31, 2013. The rent under this lease is $5,545 per month for the first full year of the lease and increases each year up to $6,008 per month for the last two years of the lease. On March 13, 2009, the Company filed its First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Code” (the “Plan”) with the United States Bankruptcy Court. Under this Plan, the Company’s successor (NCEY Holdings Corp), shall assume the unexpired St. James Lease with 1770 St. James Limited Partnership.
We entered into an amended lease with Essex Tanglewood Investors, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, in connection with our office space lease at 5851 San Felipe, Houston, Texas, on February 10, 2006 (the " Essex Tanglewood Lease"). The Essex Tanglewood Lease encompasses approximately 1,378 square feet of office space. The Essex Tanglewood Lease term is until September 30, 2010. The monthly rent under this lease is $2,959 from the date of the expansion of the lease in 2005 until June 30, 2007, and $3,042 per month from July 1, 2007 until September 30, 2010. Under the Plan filed on March 13, 2009, the Company’s successor (NCEY Holdings Corp), shall not assume the Essex Tanglewood Lease with Essex Tanglewood Investors, L.P.
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
As described above, the current Plan contemplates that all of our operations will cease and all of our securities will be cancelled following the approval of the Plan. The below description of our Oil and Gas Properties describes our properties and operations assuming that the Plan is not approved and such operations continue following the date of this report, which, as described above, is not currently contemplated or expected.
1.) OPERATED PROPERTIES:
The Company operates oil and gas properties in Texas under the name of Century Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Century Resources, Inc. is a bonded operator with the Railroad Commission of Texas and our Operator number is 141835. Of the properties we operate, our working interest ownership ranges from 80% in the Sargent South Field, to 100% in the San Miguel Creek, Mustang Creek, Prado, Soleberg, and Tenna Fields.
SARGENT SOUTH FIELD - MATAGORDA COUNTY, TEXAS
The Company acquired 100% of the working interest in the 3,645 acre Sargent South Field from Calpine Natural Gas (NYSE) and its partner ("Calpine") in January 2004. The Sargent South Field is located onshore in Matagorda County, Texas, east of Matagorda Bay. In 2006 the Company acquired an additional 1,610 gross acres (1,288 net acres) from the State of Texas covering adjacent lands in the Gulf of Mexico. The total leasehold owned by the Company now totals approximately 4,204 net acres. Currently, there are three (3) producing wells on the Hamill Lease; Hamill #2, Hamill #14 and Hamill #17, with daily production in excess of approximately 1,200 MCF of gas per day, (MCFGPD), however, the Company can provide no assurance that the wells will continue to produce at this rate, if at all. There are also four (4) shut-in wells, Hamill #10, Hamill #11, Hamill #19, and Hamill #1-R.
At the time of the acquisition there were two producing wells, the Hamill #2 and Hamill #19. The Hamill #19 is currently shut-in and non-producing. During 2009, the Company may attempt to deepen the Hamill #19 outside of its existing casing.
A license to a 10 square mile 3-D seismic survey ("3-D") was also acquired from Calpine and this 3-D has been reprocessed, along with some recently purchased 2-D seismic lines. New drilling locations have been identified on this lease for drilling in 2009. The seismic and geological 3-D interpretation project process will be an ongoing process. When the results from any new wells are drilled on this lease, the data from the new wells will be integrated into and used to update our ongoing interpretation project.
The Company has an ongoing workover and recompletion project underway in the Sargent South Field that began in January 2005. The Hamill #2 well was cleaned out and recompleted in November 2007 and is currently producing at the rate of approximately 550 MCF per day on a 10/64 inch choke, with a flowing tubing pressure of 480 pounds per square inch (“psi”).
During April 2008 an unsuccessful recompletion was attempted on the Hamill #10 well after the well ceased producing gas. This well is currently shut-in and being evaluated for possible recompletion.
The Hamill #11 well is currently shut in.
Hamill #14 was recompleted in April of 2008 in a new sand from perforations at 4,900 feet and is currently producing gas at the rate of approximately 277 MCF per day on a 10/64 inch choke with flowing tubing pressure of 520 psi.
The Hamill #17 was worked over in November of 2007 and during September of 2008, the #17 well was gravel packed to stop production of formation sand. The well was restored and currently produces gas from perforations in a stray sand at 5,630 feet at the rate of 241 MCF per day on a 9/64 inch choke with a flowing tubing pressure of 480 psi.
During August 2006, re-entry operations commenced on the Hamill #1-R well, that was originally drilled by Gulf Oil Corporation (“Gulf”) to a depth of 16,200 feet in 1961 and subsequently plugged and abandoned by Gulf in June 1967. Recent operations included milling out and removing numerous cement and bridge plugs set in the well when it was originally abandoned by Gulf. The well has been cleaned out to a depth of 11,000 feet inside the existing 9-5/8” casing. Cased hole logs were run in the well in October of 2006 and the well is being evaluated for possible gas sands for testing and possible production. The first recompletion attempted in November of 2006, at a depth of 5,560 feet produced gas, but in non-commercial quantities. The Hamill #1-R well is currently temporarily abandoned and being evaluated for deepening outside of casing during 2009, pending a successful reorganization in connection with our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, of which there can be no assurance.
On or about March 16, 2007, our working interest partner in the Sargent South Field, Aquatic Cellulose International Corporation (“Aquatic”), executed a Partial Assignment of Oil and Gas Lease and Bill of Sale whereby Aquatic conveyed to Century Resources, Inc., all of Aquatic’s rights, title and interest in the Hamill and Hamill leasehold for all depths below a depth of 7,000 feet below the surface. In addition, Aquatics assigned all of its interests, regardless of depth, in Hamill and Hamill well numbers 14, 19 and 1-R. In return, we repaid Aquatics all deposits made toward the Hamill 1-R and Hamill #14 workovers and released Aquatic of all prior commitments made regarding these wells.
SAN MIGUEL CREEK FIELD - MCMULLEN COUNTY, TEXAS
The San Miguel Creek Field is located in north central McMullen County, Texas, near its border with Atascosa County, approximately 75 miles due south of San Antonio, Texas. The Company currently owns and operates the 200-acre Herrera Lease and the 40-acre Wheeler #2 lease in this field (240 acres total). The Company now controls 100% of the working interest on these leases and wells. To date two new drilling locations have been identified. The Herrera #9 well was drilled in February 2007 and completed as an oil producer, and the Herrera #10 location has been staked as a possible future drilling location in 2009, pending a successful reorganization in connection with our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, of which there can be no assurance.
MUSTANG CREEK FIELD AREA WELLS - McMULLEN AND ATASCOSA COUNTIES, TEXAS.
On April 28, 2006, the Company’s then newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Gulf Coast Oil Corporation (“Gulf Coast”), acquired the majority working interest and operations over developed and undeveloped oil and gas mineral leases totaling 9,167 acres in the Mustang Creek Field area in McMullen and Atascosa Counties, Texas. On June 30, 2006, Gulf Coast acquired the remainder of the working interest ownership from another group of owners, in this same group of leases and producing wells. As a result of the June 30, 2006 closing and recent drilling activity, Gulf Coast now owns a 100% working interest in 27 oil wells and one gas well and a 75% working interest in one additional oil well for a total of 28 wells. The effective date for ownership for both acquisitions was December 1, 2005. The following table summarizes Gulf Coast’s ownership in the producing wells as of March 31, 2009:

Mustang Creek Field area is located approximately 75 miles south of San Antonio, Texas. Geologically, the Mustang Creek field area is located on the San Marcos Platform back reef of the Cretaceous Stuart City and Sligo reef trends. The field produces oil and gas from sands trapped against Wilcox faults from depths between 3,000 feet and 6,200 feet, which wells commonly have multiple Wilcox pay sands. In 2004, a new 65 square mile 3-D seismic survey was completed which helped recognize and delineate numerous shallow Wilcox anomalies. Gulf Coast acquired 9,167 acres of developed and undeveloped leases from Manti Operating Company and its partners, along with the recently drilled producing wells noted in the table above. In addition to the producing wells, in July of 2006, Gulf Coast acquired a license to approximately 45 square miles of the new 3-D seismic data and is finalizing an interpretation project to further delineate additional Wilcox drilling opportunities and possibly drilling targets at deeper depths.
As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, we have identified approximately twenty (20) un-drilled seismic anomalies and development locations based on our ongoing 3-D seismic interpretation project. Additional wells may be drilled in 2009, funding permitting and assuming a successful reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, of which there can be no assurance. From the commencement of our initial drilling program in November 2006, through December 31, 2008, we have drilled a total of twenty-six (26) prospects and locations. Of the twenty-six (26) prospects drilled, fifteen (15) are successful producing wells and nine (9) were plugged as dry holes. Additionally, in one (1) non-producing well the Swaim 60-1, we set casing to a depth of 5,800 feet and anticipate permitting this well for use as a salt water disposal well. In one (1) other new well, the Power-Swaim Unit 1-R, casing was set to 5,900 feet, based upon further geological study we plan to re-drill the lower portion of Power Swaim Unit 1-R well in an attempt to gain better structural position and complete for production. In July 2006, the Tyler Ranch Gas Unit #1, the only gas well in our Mustang Creek field, ceased producing, and as of the date of this filing it remains shut in and non-producing.

Other Production Activity in Mustang Creek Field in 2008 and 2009:
During 2008, we sold 225,236 gross barrels or 170,817 net barrels from the Mustang Creek Field oil wells. As of April 15, 2009, current daily 8/8ths oil production from the Mustang Creek Field wells was approximately 525 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) from twenty-two (22) producing oil wells.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s total proved oil reserves in the Mustang Creek Field were 854,000 barrels, compared to 1,233,000 barrels as of December 31, 2007. The decrease in proved reserves year over year was 31%, or 379,000 barrels. This decrease was due to (1) the production of 170,817 net barrels of oil during 2008 and (2) downward revisions to the reserves based on actual well performance over time, and more significantly, due to much lower oil prices projected for future years. The oil price used to project reserves on the December 31, 2007 reserve report was $91.50 compared to an oil price of $42.51 used on the December 31, 2008 reserve report. The lower oil pricing caused a significant reduction in oil reserves, as the productive life of our wells curtailed due to lower projected revenue causing the economic limit of certain wells to be reached sooner.
TENNA (HILLJE SAND) FIELD - WHARTON COUNTY, TEXAS
The Company acquired 100% of the working interest in three (3) wells in the Tenna Field in July 2003. The field is located on county road 1300 in western Wharton County, Texas, approximately 60 miles southwest of Houston, Texas. The Hillje Sand was discovered in 1991 and has been a prolific oil and gas producer at a shallow depth of 4,100 feet. We drilled a new well location, the Brothers Cattle Company #5 well, in the first quarter of 2008, and completed this new well as an oil producer, which currently produces 20 barrels of oil per day. Also, during the first quarter of 2008 a pumping unit was installed on the Hillje Oil Unit #1 and is currently producing 4 barrels of oil per day. The Brothers Cattle Company #3 continues to produce with an electrical submersible pump at the rate of approximately 20 barrels of oil per day.
SOLEBERG WILCOX FIELD - GOLIAD COUNTY, TEXAS.
On December 5, 2006, but effective November 30, 2006, the Company executed an Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with James Allen Lewis and Mildred M. Lewis covering 83.516 acres in the S.C. White Survey, Abstract 290, in Goliad County, Texas. The Company also acquired an additional 1,076 acres in this area from four additional lessors and now owns a total of 1,158 gross acres of oil and gas leases in Goliad County.
On December 6, 2006, but effective November 1, 2006, the Company executed an Assignment and Bill of Sale with Unit Petroleum Company (“Unit”) whereby Unit conveyed to the Company all of Unit’s right, title and interest in the Lewis “A” No. 1 and the Lewis “A” No. 2 wells in Goliad County, Texas, including all production equipment, surface facilities, improvements, to the extent transferable all surface use agreements, easements, right of ways, permits and similar rights and interests associated with the subject wells and oil and gas properties, located on the Lewis lease. The Company now owns 100% of the working interest in the subject inactive wells and leasehold.
In April 2007, the Company commenced workover operations on the Lewis “A” No. 2 well and attempted to establish production in the First Austin Sand at 10,500 feet. The well flowed gas in non-commercial quantities and is presently shut in. Additional flow testing occurred in late November 2007, and commercial production was not established from the current completion. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company commenced its second workover operation in the Lewis “A” No. 2 well. An apparent collapse in the 4 ½” production casing was encountered in the well at approximately 10,600 feet, preventing the removal of a cast iron bridge plug set at 11,840 feet and preventing any further completion attempt in the Second Austin sand at 11,868 feet. A second attempt was made to establish production from a shallower sand at 10,620 feet and this zone was stimulated with acid during the second quarter of 2008. This zone produced oil and gas in non-commercial quantities, and the well is currently shut in for further evaluation. The Company cannot assure that the well will be restored to production after any future workover or testing is completed. In August of 2007, the Company acquired a license for eight (8) square miles of 3-D seismic data covering the leased acreage and adjoining areas in Goliad County, Texas. The data was acquired to assist in the exploration and mapping process and to help identify additional possible exploration well locations, for future drilling and development. The interpretation project was completed in the first quarter of 2008. The Company plans to farmout or drill these prospects on its acreage in 2009, pending the outcome of its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, of which there can be no assurance.
PRADO FIELD LEASES - JIM HOGG COUNTY, TEXAS.
In June 2004, the Company acquired leases in the Prado Field comprising 1,280 acres in Jim Hogg County, Texas. The former owner was JMI Energy Inc., of Houston, Texas ("JMI"). The Company now owns 100% of the working interest in the Prado Field production, and we have finalized a seismic and geological interpretation of the field. A workover program and well plugging program commenced in November 2007 and continued into June 2008 on certain existing wells. Since the workover program commenced, we have plugged and abandoned ten (10) wells and recompleted four (4) new wells. As of March 31, 2009, production is averaging approximately 18 BOPD from four (4) pumping wells (wells KMF # 20, #30, #36 and #701). The Company has also identified three (3) new development drilling locations for possible drilling in 2009, pending a successful reorganization out of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, of which there can be no assurance.
2.) NON-OPERATED PROPERTIES: WISHBONE FIELD - LINDHOLM HANSON GAS UNIT- McMULLEN COUNTY, TEXAS:
Since January 3, 2006, the Company has owned a 15.20% non-operated working interest with a 12.214% net revenue interest in the Wishbone Field in McMullen County, Texas, which is operated by U.S. Enercorp, LTD, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas.
The field was discovered in 2004 after the successful drilling of the Lindholm-Hanson Gas Unit #1 Well, operated by U.S. Enercorp LTD of San Antonio Texas. The field produces from Upper Wilcox sands at an average depth of approximately 12,800 feet. All of the producing wells in the Lindholm-Hanson Gas Unit have been fracture stimulated using approximately 400,000 pounds of 20/40 propellant. Initial producing rates after stimulation in a number of wells has exceeded 15,000 MCFGPD per well. As of February 2009, there are nine (9) producing wells in the 640 acre unitized Lindholm-Hanson Gas Unit. Cumulative production in the field has been approximately 24 billion cubic feet of gas (Bcf). Well log analysis indicates probable and possible oil and gas production at shallow depths in the Wishbone Field. Potential future production may be achieved in the Slick sand, the 9,100 foot sand, the Hostetter sand and the Tom Lyne sands, ranging in depth from 7,000 feet to 11,000 feet, of which there can be no assurance.
Since the Company acquired its working interest in the Wishbone field, we have participated in drilling an additional three (3) new wells within the unitized Wishbone field. LH Gas Unit #10 was drilled in July of 2005. LH Gas Unit #11 was drilled in September of 2005. LH Gas Unit #9 was drilled in December of 2005. The Company also participated in drilling of the Lindholm Fee #1 in September of 2005, this well is not a part of the Lindholm-Hanson Gas unitized gas field and our working interest is smaller in this well at 12.10%.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN WISHBONE FIELD
As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s proved gas reserves in the Wishbone Field decreased by 43% to 849 MMCF from 1,478 MMCF on December 31, 2007, or a difference of 629 MMCF. Of the total 629 MMCF reduction in proved gas reserves, 119 MMCF was due to actual net gas produced during 2008, and 510 MMCF was from downward revisions to estimates of proved reserves. The majority of the 510 MMCF downward revision to proved reserves in 2008 can be attributed to a steeper decline rate associated with the existing wells and the failed recompletion attempts for proved behind pipe reserves in the LHGU #2 and LHGU #10 wells.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s proved gas reserves in the Wishbone Field were decreased by 57%. The majority of this reduction, approximately ninety percent (90%), was due to a significant reduction in future proved undeveloped (PUD) locations projected to be drilled. This reduction was based on the operator’s indication that only one more PUD may be drilled due to current high drilling costs and lower product prices. In addition, the decline rate associated with the existing proved developed producing (PDP) gas reserves was steeper than previously projected, which contributed to approximately ten percent (10%) of the decrease in the proved reserves in this field.

OTHER INDUSTRY AGREEMENTS
The Company has executed agreements with one oil and gas exploration company and one other industry investor that were interested in participating in the Company's exploration and production activities on its Hamill and Hamill lease in Matagorda County, Texas. However, the Company retained operatorship and the majority eighty percent (80%) working interest in this property. All of the Company’s other producing properties are owned 100% and operated by the Company, except for the Wishbone Field where the Company owns a 15.2% non-operated working interest.

DRILLING ACTIVITY:
The following tables set forth the results of our drilling activities over the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006:
(1) An exploratory well is a well drilled either in search of a new, as yet undiscovered oil or gas reservoir or to greatly extend the known limits of a previously discovered reservoir. A development well is a well drilled with the presently proved productive area of an oil or natural gas reservoir, as indicated by reasonable interpretations of available data, with the objective of completing in that reservoir.
(2) A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
(3) A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a producing well.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis under short-term contracts at the current area market price. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we had four purchasers that each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues on Company operated properties. Two purchasers accounted for 100% of crude oil sales. Gulf Mark Energy, Inc. purchases all of the crude oil produced from our Mustang Creek Field wells; and Flint Hill Resources, Inc., acquires the crude oil produced from our San Miguel Creek, Tenna Field and Prado Field oil wells. Two separate purchasers individually accounted for 100% of sales of natural gas products. Additionally, our non-operated properties had yet another purchaser that individually accounted for 100% of sales of all natural gas production from the Wishbone Field, for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity of our gas production to pipelines, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation. Our production is primarily from developed fields close to major pipelines or refineries and established infrastructure. As a result, we have not experienced any difficulty to date in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
OIL MARKETING
The quality of our crude oil varies by area as well as the corresponding price received. In our operated properties in the Mustang Creek and San Miguel Creek Fields in McMullen County, Texas, and the Tenna Field, in Wharton County, Texas; our oil production is primarily light sweet crude, which typically sells at or near NYMEX West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") prices adjusted for transportation costs by the purchaser.
NATURAL GAS MARKETING - OPERATED PROPERTIES
Virtually all of our natural gas production is close to existing pipelines. We sell all of our natural gas produced from the Sargent South Field to Harvest Pipeline on a month-to-month contract with prices fluctuating month-to-month based on a discount to the published Houston Ship Channel Inside FERC, first of month index price.
NATURAL GAS MARKETING -- NON-OPERATED PROPERTIES
All of the natural gas production sold from the non-operated gas wells in the Wishbone Field is sold to Cross Tex CCNG Marketing LTD. ("Cross Tex"). The price payable by Cross Tex is equal to the first of the month "Index" price published in Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market Report for the Houston Ship Channel as listed in the table entitled Market center spot-gas prices, less sixteen cents per MMBtu ($0.16/MMBtu).
