Overview
Tylerstone Ventures Corporation (“Tylerstone”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 24, 1998, with authorized common stock of 25,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001. Tylerstone’s formation and prior operations are as described in the appropriate periodic reports filed by Tylerstone with the United State Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
In the fall of 2006, Tylerstone’s then current management began discussions with the management of a company named nCoat, Inc. These discussions and eventual negotiations considered the possible mutual interest between the parties. Tylerstone was a registered and reporting company that had been completing requirements to be listed on the OTC Bulletin Board and nCoat was an operating company that needed additional capital. A merger was agreed upon whereby Tylerstone would buy nCoat, run that business and change Tylerstone’s name so that nCoat, Inc would be the name of the public entity. In anticipation of the merger of the parties, nCoat, Inc. changed its name to nCoat Automotive Group, Inc. (“nCoat Auto”) to allow Tylerstone to amend its articles of incorporation to change its name to nCoat, Inc. We completed the administrative steps and on February 3, 2007, Tylerstone entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with nCoat Auto for the purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of nCoat Auto, par value $0.001 per share (“nCoat Auto Common Stock”), in exchange for new shares of Tylerstone’s Common Stock.
On February 14, 2007, the parties to the Agreement completed the initial steps contemplated by the Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, nCoat, Inc., which was formerly Tylerstone, acquired 11,554,545 shares of nCoat Auto Common Stock from all of the shareholders of nCoat Auto, which represented 100.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of nCoat Auto Common Stock, in exchange for the issuance of 50,840,000 shares of nCoat, Inc. Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which represents 57% of the then issued and outstanding shares of nCoat, Inc.’s Common Stock. As an integral part of the Agreement, we then undertook the additional fund-raising financing steps as required by the terms of the Agreement.
As used in this report, the terms, “nCoat,” “the Company,” and “the Registrant” means nCoat, Inc., and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, unless the context indicates otherwise. The historical references to nCoat or the Company prior to the February 14, 2007, closing date refers to the historical financial information of the original nCoat, Inc. (nCoat Auto). We also will use the terms “we”, “us” and “our” in order to make the text of this document as readable as possible, only referring to the companies by name to reduce the confusion of similarly named groups.
Background and History of nCoat Auto and its Operating Subsidiaries and Affiliates
We specialize in nanotechnology research, licensing, and the commercialization, distribution and application of nano-formulated, as well as traditional, surface coatings. Our specialized coatings are used by the automotive, diesel engine, trucking, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, aerospace and oil and gas industries for heat management, corrosion resistance, friction reduction, bond strength and appearance. Operations are headquartered in Whitsett, North Carolina, which includes our largest production facility. In addition, the Company maintains satellite production facilities in Tempe, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Quakertown, Pennsylvania. As previously reported by us, we have historically had franchise agreements in France, New Zealand and Australia under which we have sold a minimal volume of its coatings to the franchisees. As of the date of this filing, the franchise agreements in Australia had been terminated either by the expiration of the original term of the franchise agreement or due to the closure of the franchisee’s business. We are currently evaluating restructuring the relationships with the operations in New Zealand and France.
nCoat operated as an unincorporated association from September 25, 2004, until January 2005 when it was incorporated in Delaware under the name and style of NanoCoat, Inc. NanoCoat, Inc. was a development stage enterprise until it completed the acquisition of High Performance Coatings, Inc. (“HPC”) on September 30, 2005. In the fall of 2006, NanoCoat, Inc., in the interest of going forward with branding and other commercial marketing efforts, elected to change its name to nCoat, Inc. and then later to nCoat Automotive Group, Inc. to allow for the nCoat/Tylerstone merger. From September 30, 2005, the date of the HPC acquisition, nCoat has been a fully operating company.
In May 2006, nCoat formed nTech, Inc. (“nTech”), a Delaware corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary, designated to develop and hold proprietary intellectual property for the nCoat group of companies. On June 29, 2007, we acquired all of the common stock of MCC, Inc. (Metallic Ceramic Coatings, Inc., or "MCCI"), a Pennsylvania corporation doing business under the brand name of Jet-Hot®.
Part of our business focuses on nanotechnology research, licensing, and the commercialization, distribution and application of nano-formulated, as well as traditional, surface coatings. Nanotechnology is the branch of science dealing with manipulating, building, and organizing material from extremely small particles, some at the molecular level. These diminutive particles can be combined in new, disruptive materials that have unique properties.
We have developed a business strategy to commercialize these new products, we have focused thus far on our specialized coatings that are used by the automotive, diesel engine, trucking recreational vehicle, motorcycle, aerospace and oil and gas industries for heat management, corrosion resistance, friction reduction, porosity reduction, bond strength and appearance.
Since inception, we have focused our resources on the following areas:
1)
Develop proprietary nanotechnology coatings formulations into commercially viable nano-formulated coatings and materials products.
2)
Fund the acquisitions of profitable high performance coating (surface treatment) companies in a highly fragmented cottage industry and to provide operating and expansion capital for growth of those acquisitions.
3)
Exploit the organic growth prospects in HPC, MCCI and in all future acquisitions. (See discussion below.)
4)
Provide a corporate structure for the daily management of all companies, interests, and stock held by nCoat and its subsidiaries, including preparation of all accounting and finance, operations, information, marketing, sales, human resource, management and other systems and process to support transition and integration of an aggressive acquisition strategy.
5)
Create competitive diversification by incorporating a “distributed” production model into the specialty coatings industry that is currently rare in the high performance coatings arena.
6)
Create competitive diversification by incorporating a “licensing” model into our business plans. This licensing will allow us to provide other applicators with our coatings.
7)
Operate nTech, HPC and MCCI and other future acquisitions to develop, integrate and sell commercially viable proprietary nano-formulated and traditional coatings products.
In anticipation of achieving growth through acquisitions and internal growth of existing operating entities, we added facilities, personnel, systems and processes to support business growth and acquisition activities. Details of these expenses are discussed below.
In September 2005, we acquired HPC, a 23-year-old Oklahoma company that has specialized in thermal barrier, corrosion resistant, lubritic and appearance high performance coatings for the motor sports and other industries. Building on these race car roots, we expanded HPC’s market-base beyond specialized engine coatings and exhaust systems, to include corporate accounts of manufacturer of commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, defense applications, motorcycles, aerospace components, aviation parts, oil and gas industry suppliers, energy producers and other sophisticated users, while continuing to provide coatings and services to the aftermarket customer.
On June 29, 2007, we acquired MCCI, a primary competitor of HPC. Management believes that MCCI’s 26-year market share growth and customer base in automotive aftermarket and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) markets could effectively double the revenues of nCoat.
Our management and science advisors, together with HPC’s and MCCI’s management, have determined that many of the coatings produced and used by us could be reformulated and patented into nano-formulated coatings, creating more efficient and effective coatings than currently produced by the industry. nTech has developed trade secret formulations using nano-scale particles to enhance the performance of its coatings. Currently, we have applied for six patents on our newly nano-formulated coatings and processes which are unique and novel to the industry. With the acquisition of MCCI, nCoat’s customer-base of over 9,000 companies and individuals is presently being served by116 employees.
Our headquarters’ address is 7237 Pace Drive, P.O. Box 38, Whitsett, NC 27377, and our phone number is (336) 447-2000.
Results of Operations
Performance in Fourth Quarter of 2009 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2008
Performance Overview
The quarter to quarter revenues declined approximately $126,000 due in large part to the softness in the economy and its impact on purchases of aftermarket products and services and to a lesser degree slower orders in the truck manufacturing industry. Our direct aftermarket sales were down 40% year over year. In addition, according to industry sources, heavy-duty truck sales are down 65% over two years that began early in 2007.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from 78% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 57% for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. This favorable decrease is the result of plant consolidation and lean manufacturing processes established.
General and Administrative Expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 decreased by approximately $185,328 and decreased as a percentage of sales from 58% to 44% for the same period in 2008.
Sales and Marketing Expense.
Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased by approximately $55,000 and decreased to 8% of sales compared to 9% for the same period in 2008. This reduction in 2008, when compared to the same period in 2008, is attributable to reduced expenditure in print advertising, employees and promotional sponsorships. Management has shifted emphasis to internet based promotions which have proved to be cost effective in relationship to revenue production.
Interest Expense.
The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of the change in the redemption premium for the Series A and B notes described above. This change in premium is a function of stock price, which was $0.002 per share as of January 1, 2009. This resulting calculation increased the carrying value of the Series A and B notes to a total of $695,169,706.
Earnings per Share.
Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding as of 12/31/09 totaled 104,954,706 compared to 98,045,014 shares last year.
The Company incurred losses of $262,494 and $27,441,151 during the three month periods ended December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.
Performance in the Twelve Months of 2009 Compared to Twelve Months of
Performance Overview
When compared to the twelve month period ending December 2008, the year to date decrease in revenue of approximately $4,774,000 is attributable to the acquisition of MCCI on June 29, 2007 and organic sales. Factors impacting our year to year revenue comparisons include the impact of the reduced number diesel engines being produced by our customers which was offset by the impact of increased market share represented by the MCCI acquisition, especially in the first half of the year.
Cost of Sales.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 57% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 65% for the same period in 2008. Prior year includes costs associated with start-up operations with new facilities. Management has continued efforts to drive down unit costs through lean manufacturing and Six Sigma process improvements, automation, and logistical changes.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined by approximately $1.8 million to 50% of sales compared to 55% for the same period in 2008. The expense for 2008 reflects the grant of shares of common stock to employees during the first and third quarter and the related expense of $1,222,044.
Sales and Marketing Expense
Total expenditures for Sales and Marketing expense decreased by $38,000 of prior year cost, due to a reduction in advertising in market publications.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by approximately $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase reflects the impact of the Series A and B Convertible Notes described above. The redemption premium is a function of stock price at period end.
Earnings per Share.
As a result of the share exchange transaction, issuance of employee stock, exercise of warrants and conversion of debt, the number of outstanding shares has increased to 126,710,605 and the weighted average shares have increased from 98,045,014 for the year ended December 31, 2008 to 104,954,706 as of December 31, 2009.
The Company incurred losses of $574,239,722 and $327,362,638 for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Operating Activities used a negative $128,099 of cash for 2009. Operating Activities generated a positive $286,462 in cash during 2008.
Gross Margins
Average gross margins for consolidated operations improved by approximate 60% year over year, increasing from 35% at year end 2008 to 43% at year end 2009. Increases were attributable to reduced manufacturing costs, lean manufacturing efficiencies which reduced production labor, the acquisition of MCCI which added additional high margin aftermarket customers and negotiated reductions in purchase of source materials based on volume.
EBITDA
nCoat Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) significantly improved in 2009 over 2008. Year end 2008 EBITDA was ($1,843,554) compared to year end 2009 EBITDA of ($339,991). Changes are attributable to significant expense reductions in production, sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and other operating areas.
Financial Statements, One-Time Charges and Capital Expenditures
As we commenced our planned growth in 2007 with the promise of funding, we experienced higher costs which were attributable to the infrastructure of a company with a larger footprint. During the second half of 2007 as we reduced costs through the transition and integration of the newly acquired MCCI, it became more apparent to management that funding commitments had been disappointing. Efforts were commenced to reduce additional costs. We have included reductions in personnel, consolidation of facilities and emphasis on lean manufacturing practices. Our resulting operational savings have been encouraging.
1. Facilities - We consolidated our operations in Mississippi into our Oklahoma and North Carolina facilities. In November we consolidated our Utah operations into Arizona and North Carolina. We are exploring further plant consolidation to increase the use capacity in existing locations. Although location consolidation provides for long-range savings, in some cases the additional one-time charges associated with such closure appear to affect earnings directly.
Our 2009 plans also call for (1) the installation in North Carolina of existing equipment transferred from the closing of the Mississippi and Utah production plants as a second OEM production line and (2) installation of a third production line dedicated solely to aftermarket production using equipment transferred from the Mississippi plant, at a total installation and build-out cost of approximately $250,000 for both new lines, predicated upon economic trends.
We also began consolidation of our Pennsylvania operations into North Carolina, Oklahoma and Arizona facilities beginning in November 2009 and culminating with the closing of the Pennsylvania plant in January 2010.
2. Personnel - The Company has reduced the workforce from over 200 employees to approximately 83 employees. This decrease comes from operating plants more efficiently and reducing management personnel which had been originally brought on to accommodate the accelerated growth projected with full funding and multiple facilities. We have focused on completion of Standard Operating Procedure documentation, preparation of information systems, accounting, human resource, production, communications, mixing and blending, strategic finance and other systems to accommodate rapid growth from internal and acquisition growth.
3. Research and Development - Our expenditures for research and development have been reduced from $376,165 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 to $321,421 for 2009. The savings reflects consolidation of facilities and redundant personnel rather than a reduction in emphasis.
4. Financing - Expenses in 2008 and 2009 differ in nature. In 2008 we experienced expenses relating to the money-raising process, including fees relating to engaging advisors to assist the Company in future financings and expenses related to creating the strategic relationships necessary to successfully execute the business plan. In 2008, the majority of the expense involved in the financing relates to interest expense, particularly the dramatic accounting for the redemption premium.
Liquidity and Capital Resources -
nCoat is a company with limited operating history and experience upon which to base an evaluation of its performance. In September of 2005, we acquired High Performance Coatings, Inc. (“HPC”), an operational coatings company, which was responsible for the majority of our consolidated revenues. In 2006, we formed an intellectual property and development entity, nTech, Inc. (“nTech”), and in June 2007, we acquired all of the common stock of Metallic Ceramic Coatings, Inc. (“MCCI”), a primary competitor of HPC with 26 years of coatings experience and historical revenues similar to HPC.
On April 13, 2007, we converted $2,000,000 of convertible debentures and $67,752 of accrued interest into 4,135,503 shares of our common stock at $0.50 per share. The remaining $500,000 of convertible debentures, along with accrued interest of $18,107, was converted to 1,036,215 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share on August 24, 2007.
From May 25, 2007, through July 9, 2007, we issued $9,000,000 of Series A 6% convertible promissory notes (the “Series A Notes”) and warrants to purchase 22,500,000 shares of common stock, exercisable at $1.00 per share through May 31, 2012. The Series A Notes are convertible into common stock at $0.40 per share through May 31, 2010 when the Series A Notes are due. On May 31, 2007, the Company issued $3,250,000 of Series B 6% convertible promissory notes (the “Series B Notes”) and warrants to purchase 8,125,000 shares of common stock at $0.80 per share through May 31, 2010. The Series B Notes are convertible into common stock at $0.40 per share through May 31, 2010 when the Series B Notes are due. The Series A and B private placement offerings included the conversion of $800,000 of advances from investors of which $700,000 had been received prior to March 31, 2007. The Company received $10,618,916 of proceeds from the issuance of the Series A and Series B convertible notes, net of the $700,000 of advances previously recognized and net of cash offering costs of $931,064.
In the final stages of the offering, after we had closed on the purchase of MCCI, a subscribed investor did not fund its portion of offering. Our intended use of proceeds included retirement of debt and related accrued interest of $3,677,286, $5,000,000 for the acquisition of MCCI, payment of significant pre-offering liabilities and establishing a working capital reserve. The retirement of pre-offering liabilities and the working capital portion of the offering did not get raised prior to our contractual obligation to close the offering. This deficiency of the expected $6,500,000 in funding, combined with the seasonal lull in aftermarket and OEM revenues, caused us to experience a significant liquidity crisis. A number of our vendors turned our account over to collection agencies and at December 31, 2009, we had accounts payable in excess of $2.0 million over 120 days past due.
At December 31, 2009 we are in technical breech of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the related Series A and B Convertible Notes and Registration Agreement (collectively the “Note Agreement”). This technical breech is due to our failure to pay partial liquidating damages and failure to pay interest nCoat is attempting to negotiate a restructure of these debenture notes to provide a work out arrangement favorable to both current debenture holders and shareholders. To accomplish this restructure, nCoat must raise in the next twelve (12) months, additional capital to satisfy negotiated demands of the current debenture holders and to pay aged accounts payables current owed by nCoat to its vendors. Capital raised to this end may (1) be accomplished in a debt instrument which will incur debt to the Company, and/or (2) be raised in an equity offering which may create significant dilution to current shareholders, or (3) not be completed at all. nCoat is seeking in the restructured a negotiated settlement of all outstanding penalties, interest, carrying charges and principal accrued under the current debenture notes. Any changes to the agreement or to accounting treatment described herein will be reflected in subsequent periods.
Although no demand has been made, the Note Agreement provides that in the event of a breech, within the first 12 months following closing, the holders are entitled to demand immediate redemption of all, or any portion of, the face value of the Series A Notes and Series B Notes, along with a redemption premium. This premium is the greater of 25% or the product of a multiplicand whose numerator is the stock price on the day of the default trigger event divided by the weighted market price at the beginning of each month thereafter. As a result, the full face value of the Notes and redemption premium are shown on our Balance Sheet as current liabilities at December 31, 2009.
We have been active in our attempt to reduce our losses and conserve cash. We have had a reduction in work force and reduced head count by 80 employees. Following the acquisition of MCCI we consolidated our two Arizona facilities. During 2007, certain salaried employees (largely senior executives) elected to defer all or a portion of their salaries at various pay periods totaling $215000 in total deferred salary. In 2008, $84,000 of the 2007 deferred salary was repaid. During 2008, certain salaried employees (largely senior executives) elected to defer all or a portion of their salaries at various pay periods totaling $94,000 in total deferred salary. $28,000 of that 2008 deferred salary was repaid. As a subsequent event, during 2009, certain salaried senior management employees elected to defer all or a portion of their salaries at various pay periods totaling $503,035 in total deferred salary since January 1, 2009. We have limited travel and curtailed expenditures. In August, we closed our plant operations in Mississippi, sending the workflow to Oklahoma and North Carolina. As of November 2008, we moved the Utah operations into the Arizona plant.
At December 31, 2009, we had assets of $3,766,145. Total Stockholders’ Deficit is $915,415,138, resulting from the Redemption Premium associated with the Series A and B Convertible Notes of approximately $912 million. Any amounts owed to related parties have no specific terms of repayment and bear no interest.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases for it production facilities and office space.
Item 3
