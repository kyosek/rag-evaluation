Rental Rates and Occupancy
The following table sets forth the average annual rental rates and occupancy for 2005 and 2004 for each property.
(1)
The increase in occupancy at The Apartments is due to an improved tenant base, more effective marketing, and an improved pricing structure developed to maintain competitiveness with other properties in the market.
(2)
The increase in occupancy at Belmont Place Apartments is due to the redevelopment of the property being completed during 2005 (see discussion below).
(3)
The increase in occupancy at Foothill Place Apartments is due to an improved local economy.
(4)
The increase in occupancy at Knollwood and Post Ridge Apartments are due to a more stable tenant base after stricter credit policies were enacted in 2004 and strong marketing efforts by the leasing staff.
(5)
The decrease in occupancy at Rivers Edge Apartments is due to tenants purchasing homes.
During 2003, the General Partner determined that Belmont Place Apartments suffered from severe structural defects in the buildings’ foundation and as such, demolished the property. The General Partner designed and approved a redevelopment plan for the property. Site work on the redevelopment began during the fourth quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2005, all 326 units had been completed and were available for rental.
The Partnership entered into a construction contract with Casden Builders, Inc. (a related party) to develop the new Belmont Place Apartments at an estimated cost of approximately $26.9 million. The construction contract provides for the payment of the cost of the work plus a fee without a maximum guaranteed price. Construction was completed in 2005 at a total project cost of approximately $31.9 million. The Partnership has funded construction expenditures from operating cash flow, proceeds from a cross collateralized loan, Partnership reserves, loans from an affiliate of the General Partner and sales proceeds. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately $7,556,000 and $20,338,000 of construction costs were incurred, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Partnership capitalized interest costs of approximately $394,000, $705,000, and $390,000 tax and insurance expenses of approximately $6,000, $136,000, and $226,000, and other construction period operating expenses of approximately $10,000, $105,000, and $351,000, respectively. In addition, during 2004 the Partnership paid prepayment penalties of approximately $170,000, which were also capitalized as part of the construction cost, see discussion below.
As part of the redevelopment, during the year ended December 31, 2004, an affiliate of the General Partner advanced the Partnership approximately $5,600,000 to repay the mortgage and associated accrued interest encumbering Belmont Place Apartments. The loan was scheduled to mature in December 2005.

The Partnership also paid prepayment penalties of approximately $170,000, which were capitalized as part of the construction cost.
As noted under "Item 1. Description of Business", the real estate industry is highly competitive. All of the properties are subject to competition from other residential apartment complexes in the area. The General Partner believes that all of the properties are adequately insured. Each property is an apartment complex which leases units for lease terms of one year or less. No residential tenant leases 10% or more of the available rental space. All of the properties are in good physical condition, with the exception of Belmont Place Apartments, as described above, subject to normal depreciation and deterioration as is typical for assets of this type and age.

Such capital expenditures will depend on the physical condition of the property as well as anticipated cash flow generated by the property.
Village East Apartments
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Partnership completed approximately $274,000 of capital improvements at the property, consisting primarily of structural improvements, balcony and stairway replacements, and floor covering replacements. These improvements were funded from operating cash flow. The Partnership regularly evaluates the capital improvement needs of the property. While the Partnership has no material commitments for property improvements and replacements, certain routine capital expenditures are anticipated during 2006. Such capital expenditures will depend on the physical condition of the property as well as anticipated cash flow generated by the property.
Capital expenditures will be incurred only if cash is available from operations or from Partnership reserves. To the extent that capital improvements are completed, the Partnership’s distributable cash flow, if any, may be adversely affected at least in the short term.
