Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income-producing real estate. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound, and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, the Company has acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1996 consisted of office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping centers, single-family residences, hotels and developed land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgages in which the Company invests without a vote of the Company's stockholders.
At December 31, 1996, the obligors on $13.5 million or 24% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of the Company. Also at that date, $1.6 million or 3% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio was in default.

* Includes a mortgage note receivable collateralized by three condominium mortgage loans.
During 1996, the Company collected $4.3 million in interest and $1.5 million in principal on its mortgage notes receivable. The Company plans, for the foreseeable future, to hold, to the extent its liquidity permits, rather than to sell in the secondary market, the mortgage notes in its portfolio.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in first mortgage loans, with either short-, medium- or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Company's general policy to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1996.
The borrower on a $1.7 million mortgage note receivable secured by land in Osceola, Florida, failed to pay the note on its November 1, 1993 maturity. The Company instituted foreclosure proceedings and was awarded summary judgment in January 1994. During 1994 and 1995, the borrower paid the Company a total of $270,000 in nonrefundable fees to delay foreclosure of the property until April 24, 1995. On April 21, 1995, the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. On August 24, 1996, the bankruptcy court's stay was lifted allowing the Company to proceed with foreclosure. The note had a principal balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 1996. On February 21, 1997, the Company sold its note for $1.8 million in cash. The Company will recognize a gain of approximately $150,000 on the sale.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage note is a mortgage note having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would other-

wise make a first mortgage loan. The following discussion briefly describes events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1996.
In February 1996, the Company refinanced the $7.8 million of debt collateralized by a mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $18.2 million at December 31, 1996, which is secured by a shopping center in Las Vegas, Nevada, for $12.0 million. The Company received net refinancing proceeds of $2.3 million after the payoff of the existing debt, payment of various closing costs associated with the refinancing and making a $1.5 million paydown on the term loan secured by the Las Colinas I land in Las Colinas, Texas, in exchange for that lender's release of its participation in the note receivable. The new loan bears interest at 15% per annum, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $152,000 and matures in February 1998.
In August 1990, the Company foreclosed on its fourth lien note receivable secured by the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company acquired the hotel and casino through foreclosure subject to first and second lien mortgages totaling $10.0 million. In June 1992, the Company sold the hotel and casino for a $22.0 million wraparound mortgage note receivable, a $500,000 unsecured note receivable, which was collected in full, and $100,000 in cash. The $22.0 million note bears interest at 11% and was scheduled to mature in July 1995. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $4.6 million in connection with the sale of the hotel and casino resulting from a disputed third lien mortgage being subordinated to the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable. The Company and the borrower agreed to extend the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable to December 31, 1995. A one percent extension fee was added to the principal balance of the wraparound mortgage note. The monthly payments on the note remained at $175,000 per month as did the other terms of the note. At the note's extended maturity, the Company and the borrower again agreed to extend the Company's wraparound mortgage note to July 1, 1996. A one percent extension fee was again added to the principal balance of the Company's wraparound mortgage note. The monthly payments on the wraparound mortgage note remained at $175,000 per month as did the other terms of the note. The Company's modified wraparound note continued to accrue interest at 11% per annum with any unpaid interest being added monthly to the principal balance. In March 1997, the wraparound note was again modified and extended. The wraparound note now matures in June 1999 with the borrower having two one year extension options. The modified wraparound note bears interest at 10.5% per annum the first year, 11.5% per annum the second year and $12.5% per annum the third year and in any extension period and requires an annual $500,000 principal paydown. The borrower is also required to invest $2.0 million in improvements to the hotel and casino within four months of the March 1997 modification and an additional $2.0 million prior to December 1997. The borrower has also pledged 1,500,000 shares of common stock in Crowne Ventures, Inc., as additional collateral. The borrower is making payments in accordance with the terms of the modified note. The Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable had a principal balance of $27.6 million at December 31, 1996. Prior to the March 1997 modifica-

tion and extension, the Company recognized interest income on this wraparound mortgage note only to the extent interest was collected.
In April 1996, the underlying liens relating to this wraparound mortgage note receivable were refinanced for $16.8 million. The Company received net cash of $11.2 million after the payoff of the underlying liens then totaling $2.9 million, the payment of various closing costs associated with the refinancing and making a $1.4 million paydown on the term loan secured by the Las Colinas I land in Las Colinas, Texas, in exchange for that lender's release of its participation in the wraparound note receivable. The new underlying lien bears interest at 16.5% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments of $180,000, at a rate of 12.5% per annum, with the remaining 4% being deferred and added to the loan's principal balance. The loan matures in April 1998. The Company paid BCM a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $168,000 based upon the $16.8 million refinancing.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such notes are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such notes ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the note, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loans funded in 1996 and the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage notes during 1996.
In May 1996, the Company funded a $100,000 second lien mortgage secured by a single family residence in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The mortgage note receivable bears interest at 10% per annum, with the principal and all accrued but unpaid interest being payable in a single installment on demand or the note's June 1, 1998 maturity.
At December 31, 1996, the Company held a mortgage note receivable secured by a third lien mortgage secured by a commercial property in South Carolina and personal guaranties of several individuals. The note had an extended maturity date of September 1, 1996. The Company and the borrower have again agreed to extend the mortgage note receivable's maturity date to September 1, 1997. The extension required an additional $90,000 principal reduction payment payable in three equal monthly installments beginning November 1, 1996. The Company received $85,000 of the required principal reduction payments in 1996 and the remaining $5,000 in 1997. The monthly interest, quarterly principal reduction payments of $25,000 and all other terms remained the same. The principal balance of the note was $93,000 at December 31, 1996 and the note is performing in accordance with its modified terms.
The Company holds a junior mortgage note receivable secured by the Williamsburg Hospitality House in Williamsburg, Virginia, that is subject to a first lien mortgage of $12.0 million at December 31, 1996. In October 1993, the then first lien debt was restructured and split into three pieces. During 1995, the Company advanced the borrower $3.3 million to payoff the then second lien, allowing the borrower to receive
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
a $2.4 million discount offered by the lender for early payoff of such lien. In conjunction with such advance, the Company extended the maturity date of its note to April 1, 1996. All other terms of the note remained unchanged. In December 1996, the underlying lien debt was refinanced for $12.0 million. Of the loan proceeds, $9.0 million was used to payoff the existing underlying lien, $700,000 was applied to the principal and interest due the Company with the remainder of the loan proceeds being used to fund a repair escrow and pay various closing costs associated with the refinancing. The new first mortgage bears interest at 9.85% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $120,000 and matures in December 2001. The Company is the 1% general partner in the partnership owning the property. The partnership paid a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $128,000 to BCM based on the $12.0 million purchase price.
At December 31, 1996, the Company held a mortgage note receivable secured by an apartment complex in Merriville, Indiana, with a principal balance of $3.5 million. The property is owned by a subsidiary of Davister Corp. ("Davister"), a general partner in a partnership that owns approximately 5.2% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The note matured in December 1996. The Company and borrower have agreed to a modification and extension of the note. The modified note receivable continues to bear interest at 10% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $42,000 and has an extended maturity date of December 2000. As additional collateral for this loan, the Company has received a second lien on another property owned by Davister as well as Davister's guarantee of the loan. The note is performing in accordance with its modified terms. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships
The Company's investment in real estate entities includes (i) equity securities of three publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REIT") (collectively the "REITs"), CMET, IORI and TCI, (ii) units of limited partner interest of NRLP, (iii) a general partner interest in NRLP and NOLP, through its 96% limited partner interest in SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, and (iv) interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. Gene E. Phillips, Chairman of the Board and Director of the Company until November 16, 1992, served until May 15, 1996, as a director and Chief Executive Officer of SAMI, a company owned by BCM, which serves as SAMLP's managing general partner. Mr. Paulson, Executive Vice President of the Company, serves as the sole director and as President of SAMI. Mr. Phillips is also a general partner of SAMLP. BCM, the Company's advisor, serves as advisor to the REITs, and performs certain administrative and management functions for NRLP and NOLP on behalf of SAMLP.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP in 1989, the Company has made additional investments in the equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The Company's cost with respect to shares of the REITs at
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
December 31, 1996 totaled $27.0 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $29.7 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of such equity securities of the REITs and NRLP was $37.7 million at December 31, 1996 and the aggregate market value of such equity securities was $81.8 million. The aggregate investee book value of the equity securities of the REITs and the Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity based upon the December 31, 1996 financial statements of each such entity was $63.0 million and $188.5 million, respectively. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
The Company's Board of Directors authorized the expenditure by the Company of up to an aggregate of $25.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, units of NRLP and shares of the REITs, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. In February 1997, the Company's Board of Directors increased such authorization to $35.0 million. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had expended $3.8 million to units of NRLP and an aggregate of $5.6 million to acquire shares of the REITs, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. The Company expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP.
At December 31, 1996, SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, owned 26,475 shares of TCI. The Company owns a 96% limited partnership interest in SAMLP which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes.
The purchases of the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP were made for the purpose of investment and were based principally on the opinion of the Company's management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination by the Company to purchase additional equity securities of the REITs and NRLP is made on an entity-by-entity basis and depends on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of the Company's management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities. Substantially all of the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP owned by the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings. Pertinent information regarding the Company's investment in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP, at December 31, 1996, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
- --------------- * At December 31, 1996, NRLP reported a deficit partners' capital. The Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity, however, was $188.5 million. Revaluation equity is defined as the difference between the appraised value of the partnership's real estate, adjusted to reflect the partnership's estimate of disposition costs, and the amount of the mortgage notes payable and accrued interest encumbering such property as reported in NRLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1996.
Each of the REITs and NRLP own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, particularly in the case of NRLP, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. The Company's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
The Company does not have a controlling equity interest in any of the REITs and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of such investees. However, due to the Company's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of the REITs, and that the REITs have the same advisor as the Company and that Mr. Paulson, an Executive Vice President of the Company, is also the President of the REITs and BCM, the Company's advisor, and is the President and sole director of SAMI, a Company owned by BCM, that is the managing general partner of SAMLP, the Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of these entities. The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of these entities currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The Company continues to account for its investment in NRLP under the equity method due to the pending resignation of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP, as more fully discussed in "NRLP" below. The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of each entity's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of NRLP and the REITs, based upon information publicly reported by such entities.
NRLP. NRLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership which was formed under the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act on January 29, 1987. It commenced operations on September 18, 1987 when, through NOLP, it acquired all of the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of 35 public and private limited partnerships sponsored by or otherwise related to Southmark. NRLP is the sole limited partner of NOLP and owns
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
99% of the beneficial interest in NOLP. NRLP and NOLP operate as an economic unit and, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Partnership shall constitute references to NRLP and NOLP as a unit. The general partner and owner of 1% of the beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP is SAMLP, a Delaware limited partnership. SAMI, a company owned by BCM, is the managing general partner of SAMLP. In November 1992, NOLP transferred 52 apartment complexes and a wraparound mortgage note receivable to Garden Capital, L.P. ("GCLP"), a Delaware limited partnership in which NOLP owns a 99.3% limited partner interest. Concurrent with such transfer, GCLP refinanced all of the mortgage debt associated with the transferred properties and the wraparound mortgage note under a new first mortgage in the amount of $223.0 million.
The Company is a limited partner in SAMLP, holding a 96% limited partner interest therein, which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes. As discussed in more detail under "Real Estate" above, in August 1996, the Company purchased Southmark's 19.2% limited partner interest in SAMLP. Gene E. Phillips and SAMI are the general partners of SAMLP.
SAMI, as the managing general partner of SAMLP, has discretion in determining methods of obtaining funds for the Partnership's operations, and the acquisition and disposition of its assets. The Partnership's governing documents place no limitation on the amount of leverage that the Partnership may incur either in the aggregate or with respect to any particular property or other investment. At December 31, 1996, the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the Partnership's real estate portfolio was 44.6% computed on the basis of the ratio of total property-related debt to aggregate appraised values.
As of December 31, 1996 NRLP owned 83 properties located in 22 states. These properties consisted of 67 apartment complexes comprising 16,848 units, seven office buildings with an aggregate 495,594 square feet and nine shopping centers with an aggregate of 1.1 million square feet.
For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Partnership reported a net loss of $375,000 compared to net income of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The Partnership's net income in 1995 was attributable to a $7.7 million gain on the sale of two apartment complexes. The Partnership's loss from operations of $436,000 in 1996 was a 89% decrease when compared to its $3.9 million loss from operations in 1995. The improvement in the Partnership's 1996 operating results is due to a 1.2% increase in rents due to increased rental rates at the Partnership's apartments and commercial properties coupled with 1.5% decrease in operating expenses, primarily interest.
The Partnership has paid quarterly distributions to unitholders since the fourth quarter of 1993. In 1996, the Company received a total of $6.9 million in distributions from the Partnership. In 1995, the Company accrued 3.3 million in distributions from the Partnership that were received January 1996.

The Partnership, SAMLP, Mr. Phillips and William S. Friedman, a general partner of SAMLP until March 4, 1994, were among the defendants in a class action lawsuit arising out of the transactions discussed above whereby the Partnership was formed. An agreement settling such lawsuit as to the defendants, the Partnership, SAMLP and Messrs. Phillips and Friedman (the "Moorman Settlement Agreement"), became effective on July 5, 1990. The Moorman Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the appointment of an oversight committee for NRLP; the establishment of specified annually increasing targets for a five-year period relating to the price of NRLP units; a limitation and deferral or waiver of NRLP's reimbursement to SAMLP of certain future salary costs; and a deferral or waiver of certain future compensation to SAMLP; the required distribution to unitholders of all of the Partnership's cash from operations in excess of certain renovation costs unless the NRLP oversight committee approves alternative uses for such cash from operations; the issuance of unit purchase warrants to members of the plaintiff class; the contribution by certain co-defendants of cash and notes payable to the Partnership aggregating $5.5 million including a $2.5 million contributed by SAMLP. The Partnership also agreed to pay certain settlement costs, including plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in the amount of $3.4 million. The settlement plan remains in effect until the withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The Moorman Settlement Agreement provides for the resignation and replacement of SAMLP as general partner if the price targets are not met for two consecutive anniversary dates. The Partnership did not meet the unit price targets for the first and second anniversary dates. On July 8, 1992, SAMLP notified the NRLP Oversight Committee of the failure to meet the unit price targets for two successive years and that it expects to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner would require the Partnership to purchase SAMLP's general partner interest (the "Redeemable General Partner Interest") at its then fair value, and to pay certain fees and other compensation as provided in the partnership agreement. SAMI, the managing general partner of SAMLP, has calculated the fair value of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be $42.0 million at December 31, 1996 before reduction for the principal balance ($4.2 million at December 31, 1996) and accrued interest ($6.2 million at December 31, 1996) on the note receivable from SAMLP for its original capital contribution to the Partnership.
In January 1995, NRLP, SAMLP, the NRLP oversight committee and William H. Elliott executed an Implementation Agreement which provides for the nomination of an entity controlled by Mr. Elliott as successor general partner and for the resolution of all related matters under the Moorman Settlement Agreement. On February 20, 1996, the parties to the Implementation Agreement executed an Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
Provided that the successor general partner is elected pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement, SAMLP shall receive $12,471,500 from the Partnership. This amount represents a compromise settlement of the net amounts owed by the Partnership to SAMLP upon SAMLP's withdrawal as General Partner and any amounts which SAMLP and its affiliates may owe to the Partnership. This amount shall be paid to SAMLP pursuant to a promissory note in accordance with the terms set forth in the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
In September 1996, the Judge supervising the implementation of the Moorman Settlement Agreement (the "Supervising Judge") entered an order granting tentative approval of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement and the form of notice to be sent to the original class members. However, the order reserved jurisdiction to determine other matters which must be resolved prior to final approval. Upon final approval by the Supervising Judge, the proposal to elect the successor general partner will be submitted to NRLP's unitholders for a vote. In addition, the unitholders will vote upon amendments to the Partnership Agreement which relate to the proposed compensation of the successor general partner and other related matters.
Upon approval by NRLP's unitholders, SAMLP shall withdraw as General Partner and the successor general partner shall take office. If the required approvals are obtained, it is anticipated that the successor general partner will be elected and take office during the third quarter of 1997.
The Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement provides that SAMLP, and its affiliates owning units in the Partnership shall not vote to remove the successor general partner, except for removal with cause, for a period of 36 months from the date the successor general partner takes office.
Upon the election and taking office of the successor general partner, the class action settlement plan and the NRLP oversight committee shall terminate. If the successor general partner is not elected, the existing settlement shall remain in full force and effect and all of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement shall be voided, including the compromise settlement, referred to above, of amounts owed by SAMLP and the Partnership to each other.
On September 3, 1996, Joseph B. Moorman filed a Motion for Orders Compelling Enforcement of the Moorman Settlement Agreement, Appointment to a Receiver and Collateral Relief with the Court. The motion alleged that the settling defendants had failed or refused to perform their obligations under the Moorman Settlement Agreement and had breached the Moorman Settlement Agreement. The motion also requested that SAMLP be removed as general partner and a receiver be appointed to manage the Partnership. The motion also requested that the Company be ordered to deliver to the Court all NRLP units which had been purchased by the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
Company since August 7, 1991. A hearing was held on this motion in October 1996. In January 1997, the Supervising Judge entered an order denying the motion.
On January 27, 1997, Joseph B. Moorman filed motions to (i) discharge the NRLP Oversight Committee and (ii) vacate the Court's orders and renewed his prior motions to compel enforcement of the Moorman Settlement Agreement, appoint a receiver over the Partnership, and for collateral relief against the Company. Also on January 27, 1997, Robert A. McNeil filed motions to (i) be installed as receiver for the Partnership, (ii) vacate the Court's orders, and (iii) disband the NRLP Oversight Committee.
A hearing on the motions to discharge or disband the Oversight Committee and to vacate the Court's orders was held on March 21, 1997, and the Supervising Judge ruled that neither Mr. McNeil nor Mr. Moorman had standing to bring the motions. The Supervising Judge also set June 27, 1997 as the hearing date for final approval of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
In April 1995, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Company's entering into a comfort and indemnification letter whereby the Company would agree to indemnify Mr. Elliott and any entity controlled by Mr. Elliott which is elected to serve as the successor general partner of NRLP and NOLP. Such indemnification will stand behind any indemnification to which Mr. Elliott or any entity controlled by Mr. Elliott may be entitled to under the NRLP partnership agreement.
CMET. CMET is a California business trust which was organized on August 27, 1980 and commenced operations on December 3, 1980. CMET's primary business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships and financing real estate and real estate related activities through investments in mortgage notes. CMET holds equity investments in apartment complexes and commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers) throughout the continental United States. CMET's apartment complexes and commercial properties are concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions of the continental United States. CMET also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Southeast and Southwest regions.
For the year ended December 31, 1996, CMET reported a net income of $8.7 million as compared with a net loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. CMET's 1996 net income includes gains on the sale of real estate and marketable equity securities of $10.1 million and an extraordinary gain of $812,000, whereas CMET's net loss for 1995 included no such gains. CMET's cash flow from property operations (rents collected less payments for property operating expenses) improved to $19.8 million in 1996 compared to $15.1 million in 1995. At consisted of $7.4 million in mortgage notes and interest receivable (net

of allowance for estimated losses), $214.5 million in real estate held for investment, $5.4 million in real estate held for sale, $19.8 million in investments in partnerships and other assets and $3.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.
CMET has paid regular quarterly distributions since the first quarter of 1993. The Company received a total of $1.5 million in distributions from CMET in 1996.
IORI. IORI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized on December 14, 1984 as a California business trust and commenced operations on April 10, 1985. Like CMET, IORI's primary business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships and financing real estate and real estate related activities through investments in mortgage notes. IORI holds equity investments in apartment complexes and commercial properties (office buildings) in the Pacific, Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest regions of the continental United States. IORI holds one mortgage note receivable which is secured by a shopping center in the Midwest region.
For the year ended December 31, 1996, IORI reported a net loss of $568,000 as compared with a net loss of $906,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995. The decrease in IORI's net loss is due to a decrease in equity losses of partnerships which improved from a loss of $744,000 in 1995 to income of $85,000 in 1996. The equity loss in 1995 was primarily due to the writedown of a wraparound mortgage note receivable by a partnership in which IORI has a 40% general partner interest. IORI's cash flow from property operations decreased to $3.5 million in 1996 from $3.9 million in 1995. At December 31, 1996, IORI had total assets of $63.6 million which consisted of $46.7 million in real estate held for investment, $6.6 million of real estate held for sale, $2.0 million in notes and interest receivable, $5.1 million in investments in partnerships and other assets and $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.
IORI has paid regular quarterly dividends since the first quarter of 1993. The Company received a total of $186,000 in dividends from IORI in 1996.
TCI. TCI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized on September 6, 1983, as a California business trust, and commenced operations on January 31, 1984. TCI also has investment policies similar to those of CMET and IORI. TCI holds equity investments in a hotel, apartment complexes and commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers) throughout the continental United States with a concentration in the Northeast, Southeast and Southwest regions. TCI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and Southwest regions of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Northeast and Southeast regions.

For the year ended December 31, 1996, TCI reported a net loss of $7.8 million as compared with a net loss of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. TCI's net loss for 1996 includes gains on the sale of real estate of $1.6 million and extraordinary gains of $256,000, whereas TCI's 1995 net loss included gains on the sale of real estate of $5.8 million and an extraordinary gain of $1.4 million. TCI's cash flow from property operations decreased to $12.6 million in 1996 as compared to $15.3 million in 1995. At December 31, 1996, TCI had total assets of $245.4 million, which consisted of $8.6 million in notes and interest receivable (net of allowance for estimated losses), $216.4 million in real estate held for investment, $4.0 million in real estate held for sale, $15.4 million in investments in real estate entities and other assets and $1.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 1996, TCI owned 341,500 shares of IORI's common stock, approximately 22.5% of IORI's shares then outstanding.
TCI resumed the payment of quarterly dividends in the fourth quarter of 1995. The Company received $373,000 in dividends from TCI in 1996.
SAMLP. As discussed in more detail under "Real Estate" above, in August 1996, the Company purchased a pool of assets from Southmark for $3.1 million. Included in the asset pool was Southmark's 19.2% limited partner interest in SAMLP. Such purchase increased the Company's limited partner interest in SAMLP from 76.8% to 96%. Prior to February 25, 1992, the Company had owned a 96% limited partner interest in SAMLP. In accordance with the settlement of adversary proceedings with Southmark on February 25, 1992 the Company assigned to Southmark a 19.2% limited partner interest in SAMLP. SAMLP is the 1% general partner of and holder of a 1% interest in each of NRLP and NOLP. Gene E. Phillips, a Director and Chairman of the Board of the Company until November 16, 1992, is a general partner of SAMLP, and until March 4, 1994, William S. Friedman, a Director and President of the Company until December 31, 1992, was also general Partner of SAMLP.
The Company consolidates SAMLP for financial statement purposes and accordingly SAMLP's accounts and operations are included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. See ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." As a limited partner, the Company has no role in the management of the business affairs of SAMLP. Rather, Gene E. Phillips, as a general partner of SAMLP, and SAMI, the managing general partner of SAMLP, have full and complete authority to manage SAMLP.
River Trails II. In January 1992, the Company entered into a partnership agreement with an entity affiliated with the owner of, at the time, in excess of 14% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock, to acquire 287 developed residential lots adjacent to the Company's other residential lots in Fort Worth, Texas.

Other Equity Investments
Pizza World Supreme, Inc. In April 1996, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company purchased for $10.7 million in cash 80% of the common stock of an entity which in turn had acquired 26 operating pizza parlors in various communities in California's San Joaquin Valley. Concurrent with the purchase, the Company granted to an individual an option to purchase 36.25% of the Company's subsidiary at any time for 36.25% of the Company's net investment in such subsidiary. The Company anticipates taking such entity public during 1997. Accordingly, the Company believes its control of such entity is temporary and accounts for such entity under the equity method.
