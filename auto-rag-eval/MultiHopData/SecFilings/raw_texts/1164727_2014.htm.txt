Production and Development Properties
Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each region are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
North America
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production. The majority of ores processed in Nevada are refractory ores, which require more complex processing. The remaining ores are oxide, which use conventional milling and leaching methods to process.
In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals.
All properties in Nevada are primarily accessible by road. Power for the operations is partially supplied by a power plant Newmont built and put into commercial production in 2008. The power generated at that plant is sold to Nevada Energy and then repurchased for the operations to consume. In addition, the operations utilize some power from Wells Rural Electric Company.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Carlin, Nevada, USA. Carlin operations are located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend. We have been mining gold at Carlin since 1965. Carlin’s mining operations consist of four open pits and four underground mines. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through the roaster (Mill 6), while higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Mill 5 and lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads. Carlin’s gold production for 2014 was 907,000 ounces and at December 31, 2014, reported 17.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Phoenix, Nevada, USA. Phoenix operations are comprised of the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain and the Lone Tree mine, located 20 miles northwest of Battle Mountain. The Phoenix mine is an open pit mine acquired through the Battle Mountain Gold merger and began operations in 2006. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. The Phoenix mine also constructed a copper leaching facility and a solvent extraction electrowinning facility to produce copper cathode. Lone Tree consists of residual leaching operations and ongoing reclamation activities. The Phoenix operations produced 211,000 ounces of gold and 46 million pounds of copper in 2014, and at December 31, 2014, reported 5.6 million ounces of gold reserves and 1,730 million pounds of copper reserves.
Twin Creeks, Nevada, USA. The Twin Creeks operations are comprised of the Twin Creeks mine located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, the Midas mine near the town of the same name and the Turquoise Ridge underground mine located approximately 10 miles from the Twin Creeks mine. The Twin Creeks mine is an open pit mine that began operations in 1987 and was then acquired through the Santa Fe merger. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at the Juniper mill. The autoclaves (Sage) process higher-grade refractory ores and lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads.
On February 10, 2014, the sale of our Midas Operations to Klondex Mines, Ltd was completed and is no longer a component of Twin Creeks operations.
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”) in the Turquoise Ridge mine. We report our interest in Turquoise Ridge on a pro rata basis. We have an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. In 2014, gold production of 67,000 ounces was attributable to Newmont from the joint venture.
Gold production for the Twin Creeks operations was 389,000 ounces for 2014, and at December 31, 2014, reported 6.0 million ounces of attributable gold reserves.
Long Canyon, Nevada, USA. The Long Canyon project was acquired in 2012 through the purchase of Fronteer Gold Inc. and is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure at Carlin and we believe provides the potential for significant development and operating synergies. The project has completed the definition stage of development. We have submitted the Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) to the Federal and State permitting agencies for approval and we continue to progress the exploration program in the Long Canyon district. An investment decision is expected in early 2015. At December 31, 2014 we reported 1.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
La Herradura, Mexico. We had a 44% interest in the La Herradura joint venture and related gold properties (La Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena), which are located in the Sonora desert. We completed the sale of our interest to the joint venture partner, Fresnillo PLC, on October 6, 2014. We reported our interest in La Herradura on a pro rata basis. Prior to the sale, La Herradura produced 124,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2014.
South America
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
MYSRL and a related entity have mining concessions granted by the Peruvian mining authority. Mining concessions grant MYSRL an exclusive and irrevocable right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities within a specified area. MYSRL must obtain the corresponding exploration and exploitation permits as well as the rights over the surface lands. General obligations to keep the concessions in good standing include the payment of an annual license fee and complying with a minimum annual production obligation. For mining concessions granted prior to 2008, if the production obligations are not met by the end of 2028, the mining
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
concessions will expire. For mining concessions granted in 2008 or thereafter, if minimum production is not attained by the 20th year from the date of grant, the mining concession will expire. Beginning October 1, 2011, mining companies are subject to a revised royalty and special mining tax, dependent on whether or not a stabilization agreement is in effect. The revised royalty and special mining taxes are based on a sliding scale between 1% to 12%.
Yanacocha, Peru. Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca and is primarily accessible by road. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has active open pit mines at Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua Sur, Chaquicocha, Maqui Maqui, Tapado Oeste, Marleny, and Cerro Negro. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill. The material mined is from an epithermal type deposit of high sulfidation. Power is supplied to the operation by Jefe de Energia. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2014 was 970,000 ounces (498,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2014, reported 2.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Conga, Peru. The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha and is also accessible primarily by road. Due to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review made recommendations to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a “water first” approach on June 22, 2012. In the first half of 2014, a Conga Restart Study was completed to identify and test alternatives to advancing development of the project. Following this assessment, a new plan was developed to reduce spending to focus on only the most critical work - protecting people and assets, engaging with communities, and maintaining existing project infrastructure - while maintaining optionality. Newmont will not proceed with the full development of Conga without social acceptance, solid project economics and potentially another partner to help defray costs and risk. Construction of Conga and the implementation of the independent EIA review recommendations will continue provided it can be done in a safe manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to other alternatives, which may result in a potential accounting impairment. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, above for a description of political risks related to the project’s development. At December 31, 2014, we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves.
La Zanja, Peru. We hold a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold mine near the city of Cajamarca. We report La Zanja ounces on an attributable basis and use the equity method of accounting to report our financial interest in La Zanja. The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. The mine consists of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 67,000 attributable gold ounces in 2014, and at December 31, 2014, we reported 120,000 attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Merian, Suriname. The Merian project is located in East Suriname, approximately 40 miles (66 kilometers) south of the town of Moengo and 19 miles (30 kilometers) north of the Nassau Mountains, close to the French Guiana border. At December 31, 2014, we held a 75% interest in the project, with the Government of Suriname holding the remaining 25% interest. On July 29, 2014 the Board of Directors approved full funding for the Merian project and construction began in August 2014. The development of the Merian project allows Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential. Access for the workforce and delivery of materials is primarily by road. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins, stockworks and breccias along north-west trending structural zones with minor dissemination in adjacent quartz vein zones. All of the resource gold mineralization at Merian occurs within saprolite, saprock or fresh rock. Power for the property is self-generated using on-site heavy fuel oil driven generators. At December 31, 2014, we reported 3.6 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Australia/New Zealand
In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated compensation/royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights.
Boddington, Australia. Boddington (100% owned), accessible primarily by road, is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited. Boddington consists of greenstone diorite hosted mineralization and activities continue to develop the known resource. Mining operations consist of two open pit ore bodies located adjacent to each other. Boddington’s process plant poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. The plant consists of a floatation circuit, where copper, and a portion of the gold is recovered before the material is then processed by a traditional carbon-in-leach circuit where the remaining gold is recovered. Power for the operation is sourced through the grid under a long term power purchase agreement. Boddington produced 696,000 ounces of gold and 69 million pounds of copper in 2014, and at December 31, 2014, reported 12.2 million ounces of gold reserves and 1,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Kalgoorlie, Australia. Kalgoorlie (50% owned), accessible primarily by road, comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. We report our interest in Kalgoorlie on a pro rata basis. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. Kalgoorlie consists of greenstone dolerite hosted mineralization. Processing consists of two SAG and associated ball mills, followed by gravity and a floatation circuit where the majority of gold reports to a pyrite concentrate, which is treated by conventional roasting and two ultra-fine grinding mills. Gold is finally recovered by a conventional carbon-in-leach circuit. Power for the operations is supplied through Newmont Power Pty Ltd (a wholly owned Newmont entity). Newmont Power Pty Ltd sources the power through a combination of purchase from the gas fired power plant in which Newmont holds a 50% interest and through purchase from the grid. During 2014, Kalgoorlie produced 329,000 attributable ounces of gold, and at December 31, 2014, reported 3.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Jundee, Australia. Jundee is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore solely from underground sources in 2014, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. The sale of the Jundee mine was completed on July 1, 2014. Prior to the sale, Jundee produced 138,000 ounces of gold in 2014.
Tanami, Australia. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Delivery of materials for the operations is done primarily by road while the workforce for Tanami utilizes a fly-in/fly-out program. Mining operations are predominantly focused on the Callie and Auron ore bodies at the underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak. Tanami consists of sediment hosted sheeted quartz vein mineralization. Underground development includes a potential expansion project (dual access) to increase production and lower All-in sustaining cost per ounce of the mine. Exploration is ongoing with the main focuses being underground ore definition drilling of the Auron ore body and drilling of the Federation ore body with the intention of declaring the first probable reserve from this ore body by the end of 2016. Ore is transported by road train to the processing plant at the Granites. The plant was originally commissioned in 1986 and has undergone numerous expansions. It currently consists of a crushing section followed by grinding, gravity carbon in pulp and conventional tailings disposal. Power for the operations is sourced internally and generated through the consumption of diesel.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
During 2014, the Tanami operations produced 345,000 ounces of gold, and at December 31, 2014 reported 3.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Waihi, New Zealand. Waihi (100% owned), accessible primarily by road, is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 94 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Auckland. The operations consist of the Trio underground deposit and the Martha open pit mine. The Trio underground mining operations were completed in 2014. A new underground mine, Correnso, is being developed, with commercial production commencing in 2015. Waihi consists of epithermal quartz vein mineralization in andesite. Near-mine exploration and development of new reserves is ongoing. The process plant consists of a single SAG and Ball mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Power for the operations is sourced through the grid. The Waihi operation produced 132,000 ounces of gold in 2014, and at December 31, 2014, reported 0.4 million ounces of gold reserves.
Duketon, Australia. We have a 19.45% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold project, located approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of Kalgoorlie. We report Regis ounces on an attributable basis and account for our interest as a marketable equity security. Duketon commenced production on its first mine in the third quarter of 2010 and completed construction of its second mine in 2012. Duketon produced 58,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2014. At December 31, 2014, we reported 0.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Indonesia
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta and is accessible primarily by ferry or seaplane. Batu Hijau is a large open pit porphyry copper/gold deposit mined using traditional truck and shovel techniques. The deposit is hosted by a central stock of multiple tonalite porphyries intruded into older diorite and andesite volcanic wallrocks. The deposit was discovered by Newmont in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. Power for the operations is sourced from a coal fired power station owned by the Company. In 2014, Batu Hijau produced 156 million pounds of copper (76 million attributable pounds) and 76,000 ounces of gold (37,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2014, we reported 3,150 million attributable pounds of copper reserves and 3.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
We own 31.50% of Batu Hijau through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which we own with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine. The remaining 44% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), 24%; P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), 17.8%; and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), 2.2%.
On May 6, 2011, we announced that a definitive sale and purchase agreement was signed with Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”), an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance, for 7% of PTNNT’s shares, the final stake required to be divested by the foreign shareholders to Indonesian parties under the terms of PTNNT’s Contract of Work. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was required to allow PIP to make the share purchase and the transaction has never closed.
We have identified Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. We have financing arrangements with PTPI and PTIMI, unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT; (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax; (iii) a commitment from them to support the application of our standards to the operation of Batu Hijau; and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be VIEs and our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% (20% interest net of withholding tax) to 48.50% during 2010. We currently manage the application of our standards to Batu Hijau’s operations.
In Indonesia, prior to the 2009 mining law, rights were granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Our ownership interest in PTNNT may be reduced in the future to as low as 27.5625%, with NTPBV’s interest in PTNNT reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operations at Batu Hijau or apply our operating standards. As part of the negotiation of the divestiture sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the right of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards at Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to our standards for, among other things, safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTPBV owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we could lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and could be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that reduces the value of PTNNT or for safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by us. Such loss of effective control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Africa
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The Investment Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Investment Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax not to exceed 32.5% and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection.
In 2012, the government of Ghana enacted a law that increased the corporate income tax from 25% to 35%, eliminated the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, and changed capital allowances to 20% over 5 years from the previously allowed 80% deduction in year one and then 50% per year on the remaining balance. Per our current Investment Agreement, the increase in the corporate income tax rate would be limited to 32.5% and capital allowances remain at the old rates and basis. The government of Ghana also introduced a bill in Parliament that sought to impose a “windfall profit tax” of 10% on windfall profits of mining companies. The Company believes that the windfall tax of 10% would not be applicable to our Ghana operations due to our Investment Agreement.
In addition, in 2012, the government of Ghana established a Mining Review Committee to review fiscal regimes and mining agreements with a view to ensuring that Ghana benefits adequately and fairly from the mining sector. Newmont was the first mining company in Ghana called to review its Investment Agreement. In response, a review team was formed between Newmont and the Government concluding and recommending in November 2014, certain changes to the terms of the Investment Agreement. Any such changes are still under consideration by Newmont and the Ghanaian government. After consideration and advancement to Parliament by Cabinet, changes would then need to be ratified and approved by Ghana’s Parliament to become effective. Until then, the current Investment Agreement of 2003 remains effective and binding. See Item 1A Risk Factors - “Our operations are subject to risks of doing business” for a description of risks inherent in contracts with governments.
Ahafo, Ghana. Ahafo (100% owned), which is primarily accessible by road, is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in ten pits and an underground mine presently under study. The material mined is typical of that elsewhere within the West African Birimian Formation, consisting of steep dipping shear hosted quartz dominant veins and alteration zones within intrusive and metasedimentary rocks overlain by soft saprolitic material. Exploration and development of the property is ongoing. The process plant, which was commissioned in 2006, consists of a conventional mill and standard carbon-in-leach circuit for processing oxide ore. Power is supplied to the operation by a Ghanaian government utility. Ahafo produced 442,000 ounces of gold in 2014, and at December 31, 2014, reported 9.9 million ounces of gold reserves.
Akyem, Ghana. Akyem (100% owned), which is primarily accessible by road, is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate one open pit mine at Akyem. Material mined typically consists of steep dipping brecciated and altered zones within metasedimentary rocks overlain by soft saprolitic material. Exploration and development of the property is ongoing. The process plant was commissioned in late August 2013 and ramped up to full commercial production in October 2013. It consists of a conventional mill and standard carbon-in-leach circuit for processing oxide ore. Power is supplied to the operation by a Ghanaian government utility and Akyem has on-site limited co-generation capacity that can be employed. Akyem produced 472,000 ounces of gold in 2014, its first full year of operations, and at December 31, 2014, reported 6.7 million ounces of gold reserves.

Proven and Probable Reserves
We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 82.2 million ounces at December 31, 2014, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,735 per ounce. Our 2014 reserves would decline by approximately 13% (10.3 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,200 per ounce gold price, all other assumptions remaining constant. An increase in the gold price to $1,400 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 4% (3.5 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2013, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,675 per ounce.
At December 31, 2014, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 29.8 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end attributable proven and probable gold reserves were 52.4 million ounces, including 12.7 million ounces in South America, 19.8 million ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 3.3 million ounces in Indonesia, and 16.6 million ounces in Africa.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Our attributable proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2014 were 7,930 million pounds. For 2014, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.00 or A$3.25 per pound, unchanged from 2013.
Our attributable proven and probable silver reserves at December 31, 2014 were 144 million ounces. For 2014, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $20.00 per ounce, unchanged from 2013. Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.

(1)
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates.
Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2014 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,735 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2013 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,675 per ounce unless otherwise noted.

Mineralized Material
We had attributable gold Mineralized Material of 1,568 million tons at an average grade of 0.017 ounces per ton at December 31, 2014, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,475 or NZ$1,795 per ounce. For 2013, attributable gold Mineralized Material was calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,475 or NZ$1,700 per ounce.
At December 31, 2014, our gold Mineralized Material included 204 million tons in North America, 157 million tons in South America, 211 million tons in Australia/New Zealand, 937 million tons in Indonesia, and 59 million tons in Africa.
At December 31, 2014, our attributable copper Mineralized Material of 1,266 million tons at a grade of 0.29% was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.50 or A$3.70 per pound. For 2013, attributable copper Mineralized Material was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.50 or A$3.70 per pound.
At December 31, 2014, our attributable silver Mineralized Material of 1,093 million tons at a grade of 0.040 ounces per ton was calculated at a silver price assumption of $25.00 per ounce. For 2013, attributable silver Mineralized Material was calculated at a silver price assumption of $25.00. Silver Mineralized Material is generally a by-product of gold and/or copper Mineralized Material estimates, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in future calculations of potential economic extraction.
All of our Mineralized Material is located on fee property or mining claims. Mineralized material is a mineralized ore body which has been intersected by a sufficient number of closely spaced drill holes and or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal(s) to warrant further exploration-development work. The deposit does not qualify as a commercially minable ore body until it can be legally and economically extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Metal price assumptions are based on up to approximately a twenty percent premium over reserve prices.
The Mineralized Material figures presented herein do not include that part of our Mineralized Material that have been converted to Proven and Probable Reserves as shown above (they are reported exclusive of reserves), and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper and silver, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain Mineralized Material containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of Mineralized Material.
We will publish Mineralized Materials annually, and will recalculate them at December 31, 2015, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2015.
