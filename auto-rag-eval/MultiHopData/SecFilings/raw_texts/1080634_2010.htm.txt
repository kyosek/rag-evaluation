ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We share the use of premises in Australia at Level 21, 500 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia from which our Australian subsidiaries carry on business. The Australian office space is taken on a non-exclusive basis, with no rent payable, but the usage of the premises is included in the charges that Setright Oil & Gas Pty Ltd., (an affiliate of the Company by virtue of common management, ownership and control) makes in respect to the administration of the Company.
Following implementation of our acquisition strategy we now hold interests in 9 Petroleum Exploration Permits granted by the Commonwealth of Australia. They are each held in joint venture with other parties.
VULCAN SUB-BASIN INTERESTS, TERRITORY OF ASHMORE AND CARTIER ISLANDS, AUSTRALIA (AC/P35 and AC/P39)
Geologically, AC/P35 and AC/P39 are located on the eastern margin of the Vulcan Sub-basin, a broad, deep and proven hydrocarbon-generative basin, one of a number of proven petroliferous sub-basins which together comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia.
The permits are within the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands (“the Territory”), an Australian offshore territory which was ceded from Britain and accepted by the Commonwealth of Australia (“Commonwealth”) in 1933. The responsibility for the administration of the Territory was transferred from the Northern Territory of Australia (“Northern Territory”) to the Commonwealth when a level of self-government was instituted in the Northern Territory in 1978.
The Territory comprises West, Middle and East Islands of Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island and a large area of territorial sea generated by those islands. The Territory is an area of active offshore oil and gas exploration. The islands are uninhabited, small, low and composed of coral and sand, with some grass cover.
The Territory is located on the outer edge of the continental shelf in the Indian Ocean approximately 320 km off Australia’s north-west coast and 144 kilometres south of the Indonesian Island of Roti. The Jabiru and Challis oil fields are located within the Territory, as are numerous other oil and gas accumulations and occurrences.
Petroleum extraction activities within the Territory are administered on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy through the Designated Authority protocol operating pursuant to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (Commonwealth).
Commonwealth laws, laws of the Northern Territory and Ordinances made by the Governor-General make up the body of law generally applicable in the Territory.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha, has established a wholly owned subsidiary, Vulcan Australia Pty Ltd (“Vulcan”) and transferred its interests in each of its Timor Sea permits, AC/P33 (now sold), AC/P35 and AC/P39 to Vulcan.
Joint venture operating agreements are in place for each remaining permit. The joint ventures were or are named Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33), Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35) and Nome Joint Venture (AC/P39).
Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33)
On February 18, 2010 Vulcan completed the sale of its 7.5% interest in AC/P33 to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited, a major Thailand petroleum exploration and production company. Vulcan recovered $ 4,244,679 for its 7.5% interest. These proceeds were utilized in meeting a large proportion of our obligations to the Braveheart Joint Venture and Cornea Joint Venture with respect to the costs associated with the recent drilling of the Braveheart-1 well and Cornea-3 well. The affairs of the Oliver Joint Venture have now been dissolved and will not be referred to further.
Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35)
AC/P35 (granted October 18, 2005) comprises 46 graticular blocks, totalling approximately 3,410 km² (842,645 acres). There have been five wells drilled in the area, with two having oil and gas indications, all of which were plugged and abandoned. During the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the AC/P35 permit, we obtained a range of pertinent existing reports and open file seismic data. We also acquired the purchased the right to the reprocessed Onnia 3D seismic data-set of some 1,750 km² within AC/P35.
Our geological evaluation of this permit during the quarter saw analysis of the Fairfax feature as a focus of our exploration efforts in AC/P35. The Fairfax feature was not within the area of coverage of the Onnia 3D survey, being in the west of AC/P35 and being covered only by some older seismic lines acquired by previous explorers. We saw the potential for the Fairfax feature to be a possible mirror-image of the Oliver oil/gas accumulation in AC/P33. In order to better understand the feature and to advance it to lead status, we decided to acquire a 2D seismic survey to infill the existing data bank and to constrain the south-western end of the feature. The Fairfax 2D seismic was completed in 2009, with approximately 275 kms of new high quality 2D acquired, utilizing Bergen Offshore’s BOS Atlantic vessel. The joint venture co-processed the new acquisition with some of the pre-existing seismic lines which were already held over the Fairfax feature.
The joint venture continues to assess the prospectivity of the Fairfax feature and of the AC/P35 permit generally.

Nome Joint Venture (AC/P39)
AC/P39 (granted April 7, 2006) is located 600 km west of Darwin, immediately to the east of AC/P35. It comprises 11 graticular blocks, totalling approximately 920 km² (2,273 acres). AC/P39 lies within 100 km of existing petroleum production facilities and along the eastern elevated flank of the Vulcan Sub-basin. There have been five wells drilled in the area, with two having oil and gas indications. We have obtained a range of existing reports and open file seismic data and acquired the reprocessed 920 km² Onnia 3D seismic survey within the permit. Geological evaluation of the permit is continuing, including the assessment of risk as to whether any leads are of sufficient quality to acquire new 3D seismic and whether the leads warrant the risk and cost of drilling and the likelihood of a farminee being prepared to meet the cost of such a well.
Interpretation of the 920 km² of reprocessed Onnia 3D seismic within AC/P39 is on-going. We are planning for a further 3D seismic program over our best lead in AC/P39, before making any further commitment to drill a well.
We have developed nine high risk/high impact leads within AC/P39 ranging in size from a mean scope for recovery of prospective resources of 21 million barrels (Tancred NE lead) to 340 million barrels (Ceto lead).

BROWSE BASIN INTERESTS, OFFSHORE FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA
- WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P
The Browse Basin region is a major proven hydrocarbon area and it forms a part of the extensive series of continental margin sedimentary basins that, together, comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia. The Browse Basin has been host to a series of major gas, gas condensate and oil discoveries which began with the 1971 discovery at Scott Reef-1 (now called Torosa). The Browse Basin is currently the focus for two proposals to establish new LNG export facilities; one by Woodside Energy Ltd in relation to the Torosa/Brecknock/Calliance complex and the other by Inpex Corporation in relation to the Ichthys complex. There is one well on the boundary of WA-332-P (Prudhoe-1), one well in WA-333-P (Rob Roy-1 and Braveheart-1), and a total of fifteen wells in WA-342-P, mostly associated with the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation.
The Browse Basin permits; WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P, are contiguous and are located offshore in the eastern Browse Basin. They cover a total area of 9,460 km² (2,336,620 acres).
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha, together with its joint venturers, in 2008 entered into a farmout agreement with respect to WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P (“Permits”) with Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd (“Gascorp”) whereby Gascorp agreed to earn a 15% interest in each of the three Permits in return for Gascorp expending $1,120,000 in acquiring approximately 490 line kilometres of new 2D seismic data (the Braveheart 2D survey) in the Permits and then subsequently it reduced further as a result of Gascorp, at its cost, acquiring infill seismic and a drill site survey in order to determine a specific well location from which to test the Braveheart prospect. The seismic surveys provided further coverage of the Braveheart Prospect as well as coverage of leads within WA-332-P. As a result of these farmouts, Alpha’s interest in each of the three permits reduced in two steps from 20% to 14.5%.
Separate new operating agreements were entered into for WA-332-P and WA-333-P (Braveheart) and WA-342-P (Cornea).
Braveheart Joint Venture - WA-332-P (now relinquished) & WA-333-P

The Operator of the Braveheart Joint Venture is Hawkestone.
In late 2009 and early 2010 the Braveheart prospect was drilled by the Songa Venus semi-submersible rig from a location within WA-333-P. The well failed to encounter hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned.
While there was some evidence of miner residual hydrocarbons at the top of the reservoir interval, most of the cleaner sands were water filled.
The company, through its subsidiary, has contributed $2,326,939 to the drilling of the Braveheart-1 well.
Following the drilling of Braveheart-1, the joint venture surrendered WA-332-P
Cornea Joint Venture - WA-342-P
The Cornea Joint Venture comprises the interests held in WA-342-P, which is adjacent to WA-332-P and WA-333-P.
The joint venture has carried out extensive studies as to prospectivity of the known Cornea gas/oil accumulation, where it is postulated that there is scope for recovery of prospective resources of between 40 million and 90 million barrels of oil, if our geological concepts and assumptions are correct. However, the challenges at Cornea include a low permeability reservoir with difficult to model production characteristics and the long, narrow shape of the field.
This permit is held by the Cornea Joint Venture consisting of the following parties.

The Operator of the Cornea Joint Venture is Exoil’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hawkestone Oil Pty Ltd (“Hawkestone”).
Between the 11th and 28th of December 2009, the Cornea-3 appraisal/exploration well was drilled into the Cornea oil and gas accumulation by the Songa Venus semi-submersible rig
The company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cornea Oil & Gas Pty Ltd, has contributed approximately $3,050,000 to the costs of drilling the well.
The objectives of the well were to define the location of the hydrocarbon contacts and to obtain data relating to the potential reservoir qualities.
Following the conclusion of drilling, a series of logs were run, including a Magnetic Resonance log, as conventional logging tools are unable to resolve the reservoir properties due to the glauconitic nature of the rocks. In addition, a wireline formation tester was run to assess the pressure within the reservoir and to take fluid samples.
The results of the drilling and logging of Cornea-3 can be summarised as follows:
1. An oil column of 20.4m was intersected in Cornea-3 (as defined by logs and pressure data) at 808.4m MDRT.
2. A considerable number of pressure testing results were obtained which enabled the establishment of oil and water gradients and the free water level - a significant improvement on the position known in this vicinity before the well was drilled. With the assistance of further exploration wells, this information will better enable the exploration for hydrocarbons across the Cornea feature.
3. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tool enabled the determination of an average effective, free fluid porosity of 16.4% for the reservoir in this well. The average inferred permeability of the reservoir in Cornea-3 is 100 millidarcies. The NMR tool also indicated an average hydrocarbon saturation of 70% for the free fluid porosity.
4. Extensive efforts were made to sample the oil but the unconsolidated nature of the reservoir meant that, on every attempt, the test tools became blocked with sand, preventing fluid sampling. However, the oil pressure gradient is consistent with 22 API oil and the NMR logging tool indicated an oil viscosity ranging from 4 centipose at the top of the column to 4.3 centipose at the base - this being less viscous than reported in samples recovered and interpreted by the previous wells in this vicinity.
The results of Cornea-3 defined the existence of a 23m oil column beneath the gas cap in this segment of the Cornea Central closure - a significant exploration result. A great deal has therefore been learned about how future exploration wells might be drilled in the greater Cornea closure. This has given the Joint Venture confidence about the ability to drill subsequent vertical and horizontal wells through the targeted sections and, to this end, the Joint Venture will investigate the best method to drill future wells.
Looking to the future, the data obtained from Cornea-3 will enable the Joint Venture to develop an ongoing exploration strategy, now that an oil column has been proved in Cornea-3 and useful data relating to the potential reservoir performance has been obtained. Continuing the current exploration phase with further exploration drilling is the necessary forerunner to any development strategy being formulated.
Prior to the end of the first term of the WA-342-P permit, the Cornea Joint Venture applied to renew the permit and following discussions with the regulatory authorities concerning the form of the work programme to be undertaken during a renewed term, the permit has been renewed for a further period of five years commencing from January 4, 2011 for a reduced number of blocks down to 21 and covering approximately 1,680 square kilometres.
BONAPARTE BASIN INTERESTS, OFFSHORE FROM THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA - NT/P62, NT/P65, NT/P71 and NT/P72
The Timor Sea covers a huge area underlain by the Bonaparte sedimentary basin made up of various geological segments, with potential for new hydrocarbon discoveries. The region has a long history of exploration activity and discovery and has become a focus for domestic and international petroleum exploration and development activities. There have been numerous oil, gas/condensate and gas discoveries to the north west in the region of the permits, including the Laminaria, Corallina and Bayu-Undan fields. The giant gas fields of Greater Sunrise, Evans Shoal, Caldita and Barossa are to the north and east of the permits. Recent Plover Formation discoveries have been made in the Heron-2 well and the Blackwood-1 well, in permit NT/P68 immediately north of NT/P63 and immediately south of NT/P65.
The Timor Sea is a major emerging petroleum province, with a developing emphasis in gas processing for the export market. Discoveries made over the past few years are expected to lead to the area providing substantial gas production and revenue, through value-added gas projects covering a range of gas to liquids processes and technologies.
National Gas Consortium - NT/P62, NT/P65, NT/P71 and NT/P72
Nations, on June 15, 2006, agreed to farmout 6% of its 30% interest in each of the Timor Sea Permits to NGA (leaving Nations with a net 24% interest) in return for the acquisition and funding by NGA of Nations 30% share of the new Sunshine 2D seismic survey (887 kms) and Kurrajong 2D seismic survey (3,291 km), which were acquired in November 2006.
Nations, on June 16, 2008, agreed to a further farmout of 3% of its 24% interest in each of the Timor Sea Permits to NGA (leaving Nations with a net 21% interest) in return for expenditure of AUD$1.6 million by NGA on Joint Venture exploration costs. The cost of the Company’s share of the Sunshine and Kurrajong surveys was met entirely by NGA.
On August 8, 2006, Nations, together with the other joint venturers in the National Gas Consortium, were granted petroleum exploration permits NT/P71 and NT/P72 for an initial 6-year term. Permits NT/P71 and NT/P72, which cover a total area of approximately 17,380 km² (4,294,772 acres), are located in the Australian sector of the Timor Sea, and are held by the National Gas Consortium, which holds the contiguous NT/P62, NT/P63 and NT/P64 permits to the immediate west.
The National Gas Consortium then held six permits aggregating approximately 32,255 km² (7,970,533 acres) namely, NT/P62, NT/P63, NT/P64, NT/P65, NT/ P71 and NT/P72, all within jurisdiction of Australia.

Stillwater Joint Venture - NT/P73
On March 27, 2007, the Australian Government granted our subsidiary, Alpha, a petroleum exploration permit, NT/P73, for an initial 6-year term. NT/P73 covers an area of 6,815 km² (1,683,300 acres). The Barossa and Caldita gas accumulations are located to the west of the NT/P73 permit area.
In the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the NT/P73 permit we have obtained existing reports and open file seismic data and mapped, interpreted and revised analyses and concepts for the area. We have elected to enter the second three years of the initial permit term and drill one exploration well and perform further interpretational work. There have been no wells drilled in the permit area.
Our work to date has focused on the Stillwater feature of the NW corner of NT/P73. We reached agreement with ConocoPhillips with respect to our right to approximately 200 kms² of 3D data acquired by ConocoPhillips in the NW corner of our NT/P73, most of which covers the Stillwater feature, which sits en enchelon with the Caldita gas discovery, located in the adjacent permit held by ConocoPhillips and Santos. This data has met our permit work obligation.
Following the purchase of seismic and other geological and geophysical data in 2009 Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd exercised an option to acquire a 35% interest in this permit by farmin.
