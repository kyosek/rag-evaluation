ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 60 Malls and non-controlling interests in 8 Malls as of December 31, 2017. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2017. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2016.
(3)
Excluded Malls - We exclude Malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded:
a.
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the Property or convey the secured Property to the lender. Acadiana Mall was classified as a Lender Mall as of December 31, 2017. Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2016. The foreclosure process was completed and these three Lender Malls were conveyed to their respective lenders in 2017. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Lender Malls are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers.
b.
Repositioning Malls - Malls that are currently being repositioned or where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property. This may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property,
we may determine that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. The steps taken to reposition these Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Repositioning Malls. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Cary Towne Center and Hickory Point Mall were classified as Repositioning Malls.
c.
Minority Interest Malls - Malls in which we have a 25% or less ownership interest. As of December 31, 2017, we had one Mall classified as a Minority Interest Mall, Triangle Town Center. As of December 31, 2016, River Ridge Mall and Triangle Town Center were classified in the Minority Interest Mall category. We sold our 25% interest in River Ridge Mall to our joint venture partner in the third quarter of 2017. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this unconsolidated affiliate.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Brookfield Square, Cross Creek Mall, Dakota Square Mall, EastGate Mall, Meridian Mall, St. Clair Square, Stroud Mall and WestGate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.
The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands except for sales per square foot amounts):
* Non-stabilized Mall - Mall Store Sales per Square Foot metrics are excluded from Mall Store Sales per Square Foot totals by tier and Mall portfolio totals. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo are non-stabilized malls. The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo opened in April 2017 and is included in Tier 2 based on a projection of 12-month sales.

Although Mall stores occupy only 33.0% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 67.0% is occupied by Anchors and Junior Anchors and a minor percentage is vacant), the Malls received 83.9% of their revenues from Mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2017:
(1)

See page 59 for a comparison between rents on leases that expired in the current reporting period compared to rents on new and renewal leases executed in 2017. For comparable spaces under 10,000-square-feet, we leased approximately 2.1 million square feet with stabilized mall leasing spreads averaging a decline of 5.4%, including positive spreads on new leases of 9.0% and renewal spreads declining an average of 8.7%. We expect renewal spreads to remain negative for the next several quarters as we work through maturing leases with struggling retailers as well as retailers in bankruptcy where we are negotiating occupancy cost reductions to minimize store closures. Page 59 includes new and renewal leasing activity as of December 31, 2017 with commencement dates in 2017 and 2018.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by its sales. Mall store sales represent total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet. The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total Mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for each of the past three years:

Associated Centers are managed by the staff at the Mall since it is adjacent to and usually benefits from the customers drawn to the Mall.
(2)
Community Centers - Designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.

Anchors and Junior Anchors
Anchors and Junior Anchors are an important factor in a Property’s successful performance. However, we believe that the number of traditional department store anchors will decline over time, providing us the opportunity to redevelop these spaces to attract new uses such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness centers and lifestyle retailers that engage consumers and encourage them to spend more time at our Properties. Anchors are generally a department store or, increasingly, other large format retailers, whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the Property's tenants.
Anchors and Junior Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to non-anchor tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors and Junior Anchors accounted for 14.1% of the total revenues from our Properties in 2017. Each Anchor and Junior Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2017, we added the following Anchors and Junior Anchors to our Properties, as listed below:
As of December 31, 2017, the Properties had a total of 484 Anchors and Junior Anchors, including 11 vacant Anchor and Junior Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors and Junior Anchors at our Excluded Malls. The Anchors and Junior Anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:
