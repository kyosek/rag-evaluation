ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Primary Exploration Provinces
Brigham focuses its 3-D seismic exploration efforts in natural gas and oil producing provinces where it believes 3-D technology may be effectively applied to generate relatively large potential reserve volumes per well and per field, high potential production rates and multiple producing objectives. Brigham's exploration activities are concentrated primarily in three core provinces: the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; the onshore Texas Gulf Coast; and West Texas. During the past three years, Brigham has concentrated the majority of its 3-D seismic and drilling activities on natural gas projects in its Anadarko Basin and Gulf Coast provinces primarily due to the higher expected rates of return provided by these opportunities relative to its more mature West Texas oil projects.
In 1997 and 1998, Brigham made significant investments in the acquisition of 3-D seismic and prospective acreage in its Anadarko Basin and Gulf Coast provinces. Through these investments, the Company believes it has assembled an inventory of potential drilling locations that will support a multi-year drilling program, thereby providing attractive opportunities for long-term growth. Based upon the interpreted portion of its 3-D seismic data as of December 31, 1999, the Company estimates that it has identified approximately 580 potential undrilled locations within its three core exploration provinces. From inception in 1990 through 1999, Brigham achieved net drilling costs of $0.72 per Mcfe added through its 3-D seismic exploration efforts. In addition, over 400 of Brigham's estimated potential drilling locations are in its currently active Anadarko Basin and Gulf Coast provinces where the Company has achieved inception-to-date average net drilling costs of $0.56 and $0.62 per Mcfe, respectively.
Continuing its strategy implemented during 1999, Brigham intends to focus substantially all of its efforts and available capital resources in 2000 to the drilling and monetization of its highest grade prospects within its over 5,000 square mile inventory of 3-D seismic data. Employing this emphasis during 1999, the Company achieved its lowest annual average drilling and finding and development costs of $0.37 per Mcfe and $0.52 per Mcfe, respectively. In addition, Brigham's average net drilling cost for proved developed reserve additions during 1999 was $0.63 per Mcfe.
The Company's current 2000 capital expenditure budget is estimated to be $25 million, which includes approximately $20 million to drill an estimated 30 to 40 gross wells. Brigham's planned 2000 drilling program is comprised of a balanced blend of exploration and development drilling projects with approximately 54% of budgeted drilling expenditures targeted for exploratory prospects, 28% for development locations and the remaining 18% for development locations that are contingent upon drilling success during the year. In addition, the Company's 2000 budgeted drilling expenditures have been allocated approximately 75% to its Gulf Coast province and 25% to its Anadarko Basin province, concentrated within trends where the Company has experienced exploration success historically. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."
The Company's actual capital expenditures in 2000 may differ from the estimates discussed herein based upon cash flow and capital availability during the year. There can be no assurance that any potential drilling locations identified by the Company will be drilled at all or within the expected time frame. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any well, including those currently budgeted, will depend on a number of factors, including:
o the results of exploration and development efforts and the continuing review and analysis of the seismic data;
o the availability of sufficient capital resources by the Company and other participants for drilling prospects;
o economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;
o the financial resources and results of the Company; and
o the availability of leases on reasonable terms and permitting for the potential drilling location.
In addition, there can be no assurance that the budgeted wells will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil.
Gulf Coast
The onshore Texas Gulf Coast region is a high potential, multi-pay province that lends itself to 3-D seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity. Brigham was attracted to the Gulf Coast province because of the opportunity to apply the Company's established 3-D seismic exploration approach and its staff's extensive Gulf Coast experience to a prolific, highly complex structural province with potential to discover significant natural gas reserves and production. The Company has assembled a digital data base including geographical, production, geophysical and geological information that the Company evaluates on its CAEX workstations. Brigham's team of explorationists has assembled projects in the Expanded Wilcox and Expanded Vicksburg trends in South Texas, and the Miocene and Upper, Middle, and Lower Frio trends of the mid-to-southern regions of the Texas Gulf Coast, each of which are active 3-D seismic exploration trends.
A portion of Brigham's 3-D seismic data acquisition in the Gulf Coast has been accomplished by the Company's participation in certain non-proprietary, or speculative, seismic programs. By converting certain of the Company's proprietary seismic projects in core exploration areas to speculative data, the Company was able to leverage these proprietary projects for access to substantially larger non-proprietary speculative data for minimal or no additional cost to the Company. The Company believes this 3-D seismic acquisition strategy in the Gulf Coast, in certain circumstances, can accelerate the addition of attractive potential drilling locations in targeted trends at costs that are considerably less than those associated with proprietary 3-D seismic programs, thereby enhancing expected project rates of return.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had acquired 1,096 square miles (701,440 acres) of 3-D seismic data in its Gulf Coast province. Through its drilling efforts in this region from 1996 through 1999, Brigham had completed 32 wells in 44 attempts (73% completion rate) in the Gulf Coast and had found cumulative net proved reserves of approximately 36 Bcfe at an average net drilling cost of $0.62 per Mcfe. In its Gulf Coast drilling program in 1999, the Company completed 7 wells in 12 attempts (58% completion rate) with an average working interest of 22% that contributed to the addition of approximately 12 net Bcfe of proved reserves (including revisions to previous estimates) at an average net drilling cost of $0.66 per Mcfe during the year. As of December 31, 1999, Brigham had identified approximately 210 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the Gulf Coast province, of which the Company intends to drill 20 to 25 gross wells in 2000 with an estimated average working interest of approximately 45%.
Brigham intends to focus its exploration and development drilling activities in its Gulf Coast province in the following key project areas during 2000:
Diablo Project
Brigham's Diablo Project covers 57 square miles in Brooks County, Texas, and targets shallow Frio and deep Vicksburg producing horizons. The Company is involved in a joint venture with a major integrated oil company that controls adjoining acreage to explore on the combined acreage for potential below 10,000 feet in the Vicksburg formation in this project area. Brigham has retained a 34% working interest in this joint exploration project in which the Company and its participant currently control approximately 10,000 gross and net acres of leasehold. However, in prospective zones above 10,000 feet, primarily the Frio, Brigham has retained a 100% working interest in its original 4,000 acre lease block. The Company initially acquired 25 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic in this project in 1997, and acquired an additional 33 square miles in 1998.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, Brigham confirmed a major Lower Vicksburg field discovery, the Home Run Field, in its Diablo Project with the completion of the Brigham-operated Palmer State #2 well (Brigham 34% working interest). The Palmer State #2 encountered productive reservoirs in four Lower Vicksburg intervals with 210 feet of potential pay. After completion of successive operations to fracture stimulate each of these intervals during January and February 2000, the well was successfully commingled to produce simultaneously from all four Lower Vicksburg intervals. The Palmer State #2 began flowing to sales as a commingled producer in late February 2000 at average net daily production rates of 10.1 MMcf of natural gas and 650 Bbls of condensate, or approximately 14.1 MMcfe in total. Brigham's net cost to drill, complete and fracture stimulate the Palmer State #2 was approximately $0.24 per proved developed producing Mcfe discovered, and the net PV10% of the proved producing reserves attributable to the well were more than nine times the Company's net drilling investment. Brigham's 3-D interpretative mapping indicates that the Home Run Field reservoirs have over 500 feet of relief and cover approximately 1,100 acres with estimated potential gross reserves ranging from a minimum of 80 Bcfe to over 200 Bcfe (or 23 Bcfe to 58 Bcfe net), approximately 19 net Bcfe of which were booked as proved reserves as of December 31, 1999. The Company and its project participant have established a multi-well drilling plan for the development of the Home Run Field that includes the planned drilling of a minimum of three field delineation wells and two exploratory wells in adjacent fault blocks during 2000.
The 1,100 acre Home Run Field is located upthrown from two large, untested 3-D delineated Vicksburg structures (Mariposa and Floyd) in adjacent fault blocks that cover approximately 1,200 acres. Brigham currently plans to spud an exploratory test of the estimated 1,000 acre Mariposa structure in the fourth quarter of 2000. This 3-D delineated Vicksburg feature is located beneath the shallower Mariposa Field which has produced in excess of 187 Bcf of natural gas from the Frio. The estimated 200 acre Floyd feature is an apparent four-way Lower Vicksburg closure that Brigham plans to test with an exploratory well in the third quarter of 2000. The Company believes that its Home Run Field discovery has significantly enhanced the prospectiveness of each of these large structural closures.
Southwest Danbury Project
Located in Brazoria County, Texas, Brigham's Southwest Danbury Project is an approximate 29 square mile 3-D project targeting a series of geo-pressured Lower Frio sands at depths ranging from 12,000 to 13,000 feet. The project area was well suited to 3-D seismic imaging due to the significant structural geologic complexity associated with Danbury Salt Dome that provides multiple prospective pay intervals. Since commencement of drilling operations in early 1998, Brigham has completed three wells in three attempts in this project area. The Company's two 1999 completions in this project, the Renn Gas Unit #1 (Brigham working interest 84%) and the Sebestia Gas Unit #1 (Brigham working interest 56%), discovered gross proved reserves in the Frio interval estimated at 12.4 Bcfe as of December 31, 1999, or 6.6 net Bcfe to the Company's revenue interests. Brigham has identified several additional 3-D seismic amplitude-supported prospects in the Upper and Lower Frio sections in its Southwest Danbury Project, three of which are expected to be tested in its 2000 drilling program, including one that may be an offset to its most recent discovery well in this project.
Hawkins Ranch and Millenium Projects
Brigham's Hawkins Ranch and Millenium Projects consist of 344 square miles of contiguous non-proprietary 3-D seismic data in the prolific Miocene/Frio trend in Matagorda County, Texas. Identified prospects in these project areas target potential in the shallow, nonpressured Miocene and Frio sands as well as the deeper, pressured Frio sands. Operators have been actively leasing and drilling within this acreage during the past two years. This activity has resulted in the completion of nine wells in twelve attempts, including the discovery of a 3-D delineated field that is estimated to contain gross reserves of approximately 40 Bcfe in three wells that have produced at rates in excess of 30 MMcfe of natural gas per day per well. Sustaining these high production rates, these three wells have produced in excess of 37 Bcfe in less than eighteen months. The Company's 2000 drilling program includes five 3-D seismic amplitude-supported prospects in its Hawkins Ranch and Millenium Projects that target combined gross unrisked reserve potential of 112 Bcfe. Three of these five planned exploratory wells are expected to spud during the first half of 2000. Brigham expects to retain working interests ranging from 30% to 75% in its wells planned for drilling in these project areas in 2000.
El Sauz Project
In May 1997, Brigham initiated its El Sauz Project with a seismic option covering approximately 94,000 acres in Willacy and Kennedy Counties, Texas. In 1998, the Company acquired approximately 200 square miles of 3-D seismic data over this acreage and sold a 45% working interest in the project to two industry participants which provided the Company with a significant carry on the pre-seismic land and seismic acquisition costs of the project. The El Sauz Project is an underexplored area that is bordered on three sides by Miocene and Frio fields which have in aggregate produced over 740 Bcf of natural gas and 94 MMBbls of oil. Primary targets in the El Sauz Project are the Miocene and Frio sands at depths of 4,500 to 10,000 feet, with additional potential as deep as 18,000 feet in the Lower Frio. Reserve targets range from 5 to 20 Bcf per well. Three prospects are planned for drilling in 2000, including a shallow Miocene 3-D seismic amplitude-supported four-way closure, an Upper Frio structural test and a deep multi-target Miocene and amplitude-supported Middle Frio test. In addition to these planned wells, the Company has identified nine additional potential drilling opportunities in its continuing interpretation of the 3-D seismic data within this project area. Brigham currently retains a 55% working interest in its El Sauz Project.
Caliente Project
Brigham's Caliente Project consists of 350 square miles of contiguous non-proprietary 3-D seismic data in the prolific Wilcox and Queen City trend in Duval and Webb counties of Texas. Primary targets in this project include shallow, non-pressured Queen City sands at depths ranging from 6,000 to 7,000 feet, and deeper, geo-pressured Expanded Upper Wilcox sands at depths ranging from 10,000 to 18,000 feet. Brigham has identified 35 prospects within its Caliente Project, including four prospects planned for drilling in 2000. The first of these planned wells is expected to spud during the second quarter of 2000 and will test multiple pay objectives in a fault block located updip from a well with pay on water. The Company estimates gross unrisked reserve potential attributable to this Wilcox prospect of 25 Bcfe and it expects to retain a 50% working interest in the well. During the second half of 2000, Brigham currently plans to test an additional high potential Wilcox prospect in which it expects retain a working interest of 37.5% to 50%. This prospect targets an analogous fault block to a recent discovery that encountered over 300 feet of gross pay in the target Wilcox objective. The Company estimates gross unrisked reserve potential of 37 Bcfe related to this prospect.
Anadarko Basin
The Anadarko Basin is a prolific natural gas province that the Company believes offers a combination of lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons and deeper, higher potential objectives that have been relatively under explored. This province has produced in excess of 90 Tcfe to date from numerous, historically elusive stratigraphic targets, such as the Red Fork, Upper Morrow and Springer channel sands, as well as from deeper, higher potential structural objectives, such the Lower Morrow sandstones and the Hunton and Arbuckle carbonates. In some cases, these objectives have produced in excess of 30 Bcf of natural gas from a single well at rates of up to 30 MMcf of natural gas per day. In addition, drilling economics in the Anadarko Basin are enhanced by the multi-pay nature of many of the prospects in this province, with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or bailout potential relative to the primary target zone.
Each of the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the Anadarko Basin can provide excellent targets for 3-D seismic imaging. The Company has assembled an extensive digital data base in this province, including geologic studies, basin wide geologic tops, production data, well data, geographic data and over 8,400 miles of 2-D seismic data. Brigham's explorationists integrate this data with their extensive expertise and knowledge base to generate 3-D projects in the Anadarko Basin.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had acquired 2,062 square miles (1.3 million acres) of 3-D seismic data in the Anadarko Basin. Through its drilling efforts in this region from 1994 through 1999, Brigham had completed 83 wells in 109 attempts (76% completion rate) in the Anadarko Basin and had found cumulative net proved reserves of 63 Bcfe at an average net drilling cost of $0.56 per Mcfe. In its Anadarko Basin drilling program in 1999, the Company completed 12 wells in 14 attempts (86% completion rate) with an average working interest of 40% that contributed to the addition of 15 net Bcfe of proved reserves (including revisions to previous estimates) at an average net drilling cost of $0.17 per Mcfe during the year. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had identified approximately 210 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the Anadarko Basin, of which the Company intends to drill 10 to 15 gross wells in 2000 with an estimated average working interest of 45%.
As part of its strategic initiatives to improve its capital resources and liquidity during 1999, Brigham sold certain producing and non-producing oil and natural gas properties located in its Anadarko Basin province to two separate parties for a total of $17.1 million in June 1999. The divested properties were located in two fields operated by third parties - the Chitwood Field in Grady County, Oklahoma, and the Red Deer Creek Field in Roberts County, Texas. Brigham's independent reservoir engineers estimated net proved reserve volumes attributable to the properties as of June 1, 1999 of approximately 36 Bcfe, of which 33% were classified as proved developed producing reserves and 59% were natural gas. Brigham estimated net daily production volumes from the divested properties to be approximately 2.8 MMcfe per day at the time these sales were consummated. Net proceeds from these transactions were used by the Company to reduce borrowings under its bank credit facility and to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures during the second half of 1999. The effective date of each transaction was June 30, 1999.
Brigham intends to focus its exploration and development drilling activities in its Anadarko Basin province in the following key project areas during 2000:
Arnett Project
Brigham's Arnett Project covers approximately 81,920 acres in Ellis County, Oklahoma, and targets Morrow and Hunton producing horizons at depths of 10,000 to 14,000 feet. In 1997 and 1998, the Company acquired 128 square miles of 3-D seismic in the three phases of this project. Following the sale of a portion of its interest in this project in early 1999, Brigham retains a 70% effective working interest in its Arnett Project. During 1999, Brigham completed all five wells drilled in its Arnett Project, resulting in the discovery of 11.3 gross Bcfe of proved developed reserves in Morrow sandstone objectives, or 5.4 Bcfe net to the Company's interests. Capitalizing on these discoveries, the Company plans to drill three offset Morrow locations during the first half of 2000. Each of these Morrow prospects will test natural gas reserve targets estimated at approximately 2 Bcf per well on a gross unrisked basis with dry hole costs estimated to be approximately $400,000 per well.
Huskie and Boilermaker Projects
Brigham's Huskie and Boilermaker Projects consist of 103 and 96 square miles, respectively, of continuous 3-D seismic data covering approximately 127,000 acres in Blaine County, Oklahoma. These projects target stratigraphic sand channels in the Springer-aged Old Woman and Britt intervals. Brigham initiated acquisition of data in its Huskie Project in 1996 where it retained a 37.5% working interest and, based upon the prospect density and reserve potential interpreted from this initial data set, the Company subsequently acquired data in its adjacent Boilermaker Project in 1998 where it retained a 100% working interest. The Company has assembled acreage over a number of potential drilling locations in these project areas and has at least one exploratory well planned for its Huskie Project in 2000. This well was spud during the first quarter 2000 and will test a prospect with approximately 20 Bcfe of gross unrisked reserve potential which is an extension to a prolific Springer channel that has produced over 128 Bcfe. Success from this initial exploratory well would likely establish several development locations. The Company retains a 71% working interest in this exploratory well.
Wildcat and Panther Projects
The Company's Wildcat and Panther Projects consist of 47 and 99 square miles, respectively, of continuous 3-D seismic data covering approximately 93,440 acres in the southern portion of the Texas Panhandle in Wheeler County, Texas and Beckham County, Oklahoma. The primary exploration targets within these projects are high potential, structural features at depths ranging from 7,500 to 21,000 feet. Brigham initiated acquisition of data in its Wildcat Project in 1997 where it retained a 37.5% working interest. Based upon the interpretation of this initial data set, the Company subsequently acquired data in its adjacent Panther Project in 1998 where it retained a 100% working interest. In its Wildcat Project, the Company has a deep 21,000 foot exploratory well planned for the first half of 2000 to drill an updip location to a Hunton well that has produced over 15 Bcfe since 1981 and was still producing in February 2000. The Company believes successful completion of this exploratory test could prove up an additional 55 Bcfe of remaining gross unrisked reserves in this producing structure and set up several development locations.
Bearcat Project
Brigham's Bearcat Project consists of approximately 59 square miles of 3-D seismic data covering approximately 37,760 acres in the prolific Carter Knox anticline in Grady County, Oklahoma. This project targets 3-D seismic amplitude-related shallow Pennsylvanian-aged channel sands and deep bar sands in the Springer section. In early 2000, the Company drilled its first well in its Bearcat Project, which was a 13,000 foot test of a potentially significant 3-D delineated Springer bar feature with gross unrisked reserve potential of 100 Bcfe. The well encountered a significant thickness of Springer-aged sand which confirmed Brigham's 3-D seismic interpretation of this feature. The well was being tested in late March 2000, and a successful completion would establish multiple offset development drilling opportunities.
West Texas
The Company's drilling activity in its West Texas province has been focused in the Horseshoe Atoll, the Midland Basin and the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin and in the Hardeman Basin. In response to reduced market prices for oil and comparatively higher potential natural gas projects in its Anadarko Basin and Gulf Coast provinces, the Company substantially reduced its 3-D seismic and drilling activities in its West Texas during 1998 and 1999. Based on the recent recovery in oil prices, the Company intends to undertake a comprehensive analysis of its proved and unproved West Texas assets to evaluate opportunities to generate value either through the drilling of identified 3-D prospects, the sale of promoted interests in drillable 3-D prospects or the sale of all or a portion of its proved reserves and 3-D prospect inventory.
As of December 31, 1999, Brigham had acquired 1,689 square miles (1.1 million acres) in the West Texas region. Through its drilling efforts in this region from 1990 through 1999, Brigham had completed 185 wells in 299 attempts (62% completion rate) in its West Texas province with an average working interest of 23% and had found cumulative net proved reserves of 21 Bcfe at an average net drilling cost of $1.31 per Mcfe. The Company participated in the drilling of one well with a 35% working interest in its West Texas province during 1999 which was unsuccessful. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had identified approximately 165 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in its West Texas projects. While the Company's 2000 drilling program does not currently include any wells in its West Texas province, Brigham may participate in the drilling of several of its highest quality West Texas prospects this year to capitalize on high current oil prices.
Natural Gas and Oil Reserves
The Company's estimated total net proved reserves of natural gas and oil as of December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and the present values attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows:
As of December 31, ------------------------------- 1997 1998 1999 ---------- -------- --------- Estimated net proved reserves: Natural gas (MMcf) ........................ 53,230 71,166 65,457 Oil (MBbls) ............................... 3,181 4,433 3,027 Natural gas equivalent (MMcfe) ............ 72,316 97,764 83,618 Proved developed reserves as a percentage of proved reserves ........................ 65% 57% 48% Present Value of Future Net Revenues (in thousands)............................. $ 69,249 $ 81,741 $ 114,466 Standardized Measure (in thousands).......... $ 64,274 $ 81,649 $ 113,546
The reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("Cawley Gillespie"), the Company's petroleum consultants, and are part of reports on the Company's oil and natural gas properties prepared by Cawley Gillespie. The base sales prices for the Company's reserves were $2.27 per Mcf for natural gas and $15.50 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1997, $2.12 per Mcf for natural gas and $9.50 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1998, and $2.35 per Mcf for natural gas and $22.75 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1999. These base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well-by-well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate the Company's reserves at these dates.
In accordance with applicable requirements of the SEC, estimates of the Company's proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties (except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation). Estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues therefrom are affected by oil and natural gas prices, which have fluctuated widely in recent years. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. The reserve data set forth in this Form 10-K represent only estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers, including those used by the Company, may vary. In addition, estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production, results of future development and exploration activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and other factors. The revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. The Company's estimated proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal agency. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Risk Factors -- We Are Subject To Uncertainties In Reserve Estimates And Future Net Cash Flows."
Estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial.
Drilling Activities
The Company drilled, or participated in the drilling of, the following number of wells during the periods indicated:
- ----------------
(1) From January 1, 2000 through March 23, 2000, the Company drilled, or participated in the drilling of, two gross (0.19 net) exploratory wells, of which one gross (0.17 net) was completed as a natural gas well and one gross (0.02 net) was completed as an oil well.
(2) From January 1, 2000 through March 23, 2000, the Company drilled, or participated in the drilling of, five gross (2.1 net) development wells, of which one gross (1.0 net) was completed as a natural gas well, two gross (0.03 net) were completed as oil wells and two gross (1.1 net) in the process of drilling at March 23, 2000.
The Company does not own any drilling rigs, and the majority of its drilling activities have been conducted by industry participant operators or independent contractors under standard drilling contracts. Consistent with its business strategy, the Company has continued to retain operations of an increasing number of the wells it drills. Brigham operated 44% of the gross and 73% of the net wells it participated in during 1999.
Productive Wells and Acreage
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the Company's ownership interest as of December 31, 1999 in productive natural gas and oil wells in the areas indicated.
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells waiting on pipeline connection. Wells that are completed in more than one producing horizon are counted as one well. Of the gross wells reported above, none had multiple completions.
Acreage
Undeveloped acreage includes leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. A gross acre is an acre in which an interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. The following table sets forth the approximate developed and undeveloped acreage in which the Company held a leasehold, mineral or other interest at December 31, 1999:
All the leases for the undeveloped acreage summarized in the preceding table will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless the existing leases are renewed, production has been obtained from the acreage subject to the lease prior to that date, or some other "savings clause" is implicated. The following table sets forth the minimum remaining terms of leases for the gross and net undeveloped acreage:
Acres Expiring -------------------- Gross Net ------- ------ Twelve Months Ending: December 31, 2000................... 47,537 22,409 December 31, 2001................... 64,153 33,711 December 31, 2002................... 7,215 3,992 Thereafter.......................... 21,985 12,152 ------- ------ Total........................... 140,890 72,264 ======= ======
In addition, the Company had lease options as of December 31, 1999 to acquire an additional 109,374 gross (67,119 net) acres, substantially all of which expire before June 30, 2000.
Volumes, Prices and Production Costs
The following table sets forth the production volumes, average prices received and average production costs associated with the Company's sale of oil and natural gas for the periods indicated.
Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs
The costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities are as follows (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31, ------------------------------------ 1997 1998 1999 ---------- ---------- ------------
Cost incurred for the year: Exploration....................... $ 29,516 $ 68,214 $ 19,224 Property acquisition.............. 26,956 16,245 3,462 Development....................... 2,953 10,475 4,632 Proceeds from participants........ (319) (10,502) (29,582) ----------- ----------- ---------- $ 59,106 $ 84,432 $ (2,264) =========== ========== ==========
Costs incurred represent amounts incurred by the Company for exploration, property acquisition and development activities. Periodically, the Company will receive reimbursement of certain costs from participants in its projects subsequent to project initiation in return for an interest in the project. These payments are described as "Proceeds from participants" in the table above.
ITEM 3.
