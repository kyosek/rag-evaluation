Mineral Properties
Acquisition of Primary Mining Licenses in Singida, Tanzania
On May 15, 2009, the Company signed a Mineral Financing Agreement with one director of the Company authorizing him, on behalf of the Company, to acquire Primary Mining Licenses (“PMLs”) in the Singida area. As of February 7, 2011, this director has entered into Mineral Properties Sales and Purchase agreements and addendums with various PML owners to acquire PMLs in the Singida area. As of March 31, 2013, the Company has a 100 percent ownership of 23 PMLs and 20 PMLs with net smelter production royalty payments.
In May 2011, the Company entered into joint venture agreement and service agreement with Otterburn. The Company received option payment of $300,770 in cash and 1,100,000 common shares of Otterburn which were sold to unrelated parties at a price of CAD$0.10 per share. The Company received exploration cost reimbursements from Otterburn of $1,137,226. In July, 2011, Otterburn terminated the agreements.
As of March 31, 2013, under the terms of the mineral properties sales and purchase agreements the Company has completed option payments in the amount of $2,058,322. On February 8, 2013, the Company issued a notice of the final buyout payment of 20 PMLs to the Singida PMLs owners. The payment will be made in a form of a 2% Net Smelter Production royalty. The Company also agreed to increase the royalty by 1% to 3% if commercial production is delayed beyond March 2015.
Acquisition of Primary Mining Licenses in Uyowa, Tanzania
On July 19, 2011, Guardian Investment Ltd, a related party, on behalf of the Company, entered into a mineral properties option agreement to acquire four primary mining licenses within the northern most prospecting license of the seven comprising the Uyowa Gold project. The total consideration is of $490,000, of which $40,000 was paid in 2012 and $50,000 paid in fiscal year 2013.
Licenses

Gold Projects
The following is a brief overview of our portfolio of prospective mineral properties, the exploration developments on them where applicable and some of the details of the historical option agreements for them. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, our exploration work was primarily concentrated on the Kinyambwiga, Kiabakari East and Uyowa gold projects.
Musoma Bunda Murangi Gold Project
The Musoma Bunda Murangi Project comprises of 3 Prospecting licences covering 59.29 square kilometers and 24 PMLs totaling 2 square kilometers.
Minor exploration has been undertaken on the Kinyambwiga licence (PL 4653/2007) during this period. However, no exploration was conducted on Suguti (PL PL3966/2006 ) and Murangi (PL4511/2007) projects.
Exploration Strategy
The Kinyambwiga licence has been reduced from 30.90 square kilometers to 15.45 square kilometers as part of the required Government relinquishment of 50 percent of the ground holdings on licence renewal. The southern part of the licence area, largely covered by black cotton soil and underlain by granitic rocks with no known artisanal workings, has been relinquished. The northern part of the licence is host to the Kunanga 1 to 3 artisanal mine sites. The relinquished area is currently under application on account of a soil anomaly in the NE corner of the licence.
The new artisanal mining site, located 1 kilometer along strike to the east of Kunanga 2, appears to have been abandoned with the artisanal miners moving to Kanunga 3 in the northern part of the licence.
The Kunanga 1 Prospect has been earmarked for small scale mining operations that will proceed once necessary funding and the issuing of a Mining Licence has been achieved. Currently, a scoping study involving metallurgical test work, mine planning and scheduling together with financial evaluations have been undertaken on the prospect. A total capital investment of US$3M has been targeted for the project.
Metallurgical Test work
Metallurgical test work has been completed by Peacock and Simpson, Zimbabawe and later by Met-Solve Laboratories, Canada in order to determine the percentages of gravity recoverable gold (free gold), flotation and cyanide leachable gold.
A 105 kilogram sample of the quartz vein at Kunanga 1 was collected from 3 working artisanal shafts (Table 3) that varied from 14 meters to 44 meters in depth. Samples of quartz with disseminated pyrite and minor visible gold were collected from the working face and vary in size from +10 centimeters to small chippings. An equal portion of sample was collected from each shaft, composited, split and then packed, of which 50 kilograms were shipped to Peacock and Simpson and the remaining 55 kilograms was later sent to Met-Solve Laboratories.
Table 3: Location and depth of artisanal shafts at the Kunanga 1 Prospect
Sampled Shafts for Metallurgical test work
The following basic tests were applied:
Determination of gravity recoverable gold
Determination of gravity recoverable gold + flotation using 2 different flotation reagents.
Determination of gold from cyanide leach over time
Slight differences in the methodology conducted by each of the Labs were reported but overall results are comparable.
Results
1. Peacock and Simpson
The bulk rock sample, assaying 7.24 grams per tonne, was crushed to 100 percent passing minus 1.0 millimeter size and then transferred to a Knelson concentrator; this early stage liberation test yielded a 24.2 percent gold recovery.
Fine grinding of the rock material to a size of 80 percent minus 0.075 millimeters and then transferring the material to a Knelson concentrator yielded a 54.5 percent gold recovery.
Agitated leaching of the gravity tails for a 24 hour period resulted in a gold recovery of 84.1 percent.
The overall, gold recovery from Fine Grinding with Knelson Concentration and Agitated Leaching totalled 92.7 percent.
Additional flotation tests were also carried out using:
i.
Gravity tails after impact crushing to minus 1millimeter having a head grade of 5.52g/t gold
ii.
Gravity tails after milling to 80 percent passing 75 microns having a head grade of 3.37g/t gold
A single stage flotation test was undertaken using a Denver D12 Laboratory flotation machine under the flowing conditions of CuSO4, SIBX (Sodium isobutyl Xanthate) and Dowfroth conditioning. Results indicate:
i.
Gold recovery of 18.7 percent of float feed (minus 1 millimeter)
ii.
Gold recovery of 58.3 percent of float feed (80 percent passing 76 microns)
A 2nd flotation test was carried out on gravity tails of which 80 percent passing 75 micron assaying 3.30g/t gold under different chemical conditions of CuSO4, PAX (Potassium amyl Xanthate) and Dowfroth conditioning.
Results indicate an improved gold recovery of 64.4 percent of the float feed.
Total recoveries, including gravity recoverable gold is summarised:
Gravity + CIL (leaching) = 92.7 percent recovery
Gravity + SIBX flotation = 81.0 percent recovery
Gravity + PAX flotation = 83.8 percent recovery
A Bond Index (BWi) of 19.48 was established for the sample.
2. Met-Solve Laboratories
The bulk rock sample, assaying 9.80 grams per tonne, was crushed to 100 percent passing minus 0.071 millimeter size and then processed through the Falcon L40 concentrator 3 times and yielded a gold recovery of 60.6 percent.
Two flotation tests were carried out on the gravity tails using Copper sulphate + potassium amyl Xanthate (PAX) and Methyl isobutyl Carbinol + sodium silicate (MIBC). Gold recoveries of 59.5 percent and 61.5 percent respectively were obtained. The sodium silicate did not assist in improving gold recoveries. Overall gravity + flotation returned recoveries of 85.2 percent and 85.6 percent respectively.
The flotation concentrates as well as a sub-sample of the gravity tails were subjected to cyanide leach tests for 48 hours with aliquots being collected at 1, 6 and 24 hours. Gold recoveries on the flotation concentrate were between 94.2 percent to 94.7 percent within 3 hours whereas only 88.5 percent was obtained from the gravity tails with most of the gold being recovered within a 24 hour period, This represents an overall recovery (gravity + flotation + leaching) of 84.0 percent and 84.2 percent respectively for each of the reagents used whereas the overall gravity + cyanide leach (by-passing the flotation ) achieved an overall gold recover of 95.6 percent. Results are summarised in Table 4.
Table 4: Summary of results
Mine Planning
The Kunanga 1 Prospect comprises of a small gold target that has been estimated from 40 meter spaced reverse circulation drill sections and trenches to contain a conceptual taget of between 600,000 and 1,000,000 tonnes of economically significant mineralization at grades between 1.50 and 2.00 gpt in the three vein structures at Kanunga 1 on the Kinyambwiga property within the first 150 and 200 meters of surface. Continuity of the narrow quartz veins appears to extend for a strike length of some 500 meters.
It is currently proposed to mine the mineralization by open pit mining methods using an excavator and trucks to transport the ore to an onsite processing plant. A vertical test pit to a depth of 8 meters was excavated in granitic saprolite (host rock) at site using a Caterpillar 320 excavator in a relatively short time of 3 hours. The results of the test pit proved good retaining rock wall strength, ease of excavation and the lack of ground water.
Based on these results, a pit slope of 55 degrees was modeled for the open pit to a depth of 40 meters (Map 3). The proposed site plan showing location of pit, waste dumps and processing plant is shown in Map 4.
The Mining and Mill plan is designed for processing 300 tonnes per day (Chart 1).

Environmental Impact Study
In order to apply for a Mining Licence over the 24 PMLs that in part overlie the Kunanga 1 Prospect, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study must first be carried out and an EIA Certificate obtained.
TANSHEQ, an established and experienced Tanzanian consulting firm specializing in Environmental Management, has been awarded the contract to complete the Environmental Impact Assessment study for the Kanunga 1 Prospect. Field studies were undertaken at the end of 2012 and a draft report including a Scoping report, a baseline study and the EIA report, has been submitted to the National Environment Management Council (NEMC), which is the Government body responsible for issuing the EIA certificate by the Minister responsible for Environment. A site visit by a team of NEMC officials is expected to be undertaken during May 2013 and once this site visit has taken place, the final EIA report will be prepared by TANSHEQ and then the report will be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Environment.
In the meantime, the Company has embarked on an awareness campaign with the Ministry of Mines, Environment, Lands and Water affairs as well as with the local inhabitants of the area who would be affected by the planned mining activities. To date many meetings have been held with local District representatives together with the village council and village inhabitants; all are in favour of the planned project.
Concurrently, an application to acquire an additional 15 PMLs, adjoining and covering the area immediately to the south and north of the current PML boundary has been submitted. An application to amalgamate all 39 PMLs into one mining licence is part of the current process (Map 5).
Map 5: Plan showing the 24 PMLs plus 15 additional PMLs to be amalgamated into a single licence
Future work
The completion of the EIA report and awarding of the Mining Licence is of top priority. Only once this licence has been obtained, can the Company finalize its decision on whether to proceed with the current or a revised mine plan.
The prospective area to the east of the Kunanga 1 Prospect Exploration and referred to as the Kunanga School Anomaly requires follow-up investigation.
The anomalous stone layer as encountered from previous RAB drilling during 2009 as well as the soil anomaly over the school requires further investigation. A number of auger drill traverses are planned to test the strike towards the SW where a number of anomalous soil samples have been indicated (Map 6). Since this area was previously relinquished as part of the Government requirement to reduce the PL area by 50 percent,, an application to renew the area of “shed-off” is pending approval by the Ministry of Mines.
Map 6: Kanunga 1 East and School soil anomalies
Suguti (PL3966/2006)
No exploration work has been undertaken on the Suguti licence during the course of the year.
Future Exploration
Since the northern part of the Suguti Licence has been relinquished as part of the Government requirement to reduce the PL by 50 percent, the area of “shed-off” must first be re-instated prior to commencing any further exploration. Should the area be awarded to the Company, further exploration will be focused mainly at Targets 1 and 3 across the known soil anomalies (Map 7). Infill soil sampling, including Auger drilling over mbuga covered areas, has been undertaken along 200 meter N-S traverse lines on 10 meter sample intervals in order to define the present soil anomalies. To date 157 samples including 84 auger drill samples, have been collected and are pending submission to SGS laboratories Mwanza. Results will determine whether a trenching programme is warranted across the targets.
Additional auger drill sampling is planned to be undertaken on the 200 ppb gold anomaly as well as the strike extensions of Zones 1,2 and 3 of Target 1 where no sampling has yet been undertaken (Map 7).
Map 7: Current state of exploration on the Suguti Licence showing present coverage of Auger drill and soil sampling across 3 target areas.
Murangi(PL4511/2007)
The southern part of the Murangi Licence has been relinquished as part of the Government requirement to reduce the PL by 50 percent; the area of “shed-off” (Map 8). No exploration has been undertaken during the year.
Future Exploration
Should the licence be retained, exploration will be focused primarily on 5 ground magnetic targets (Map 8) in which the following work is to be undertaken:
i. Mapping of the target areas on 1:2000 scale
ii. Gradient IP survey across the entire license
iii Auger drilling, with the Company’s recently purchased Auger Rig, across each of the Ground magnetic and IP Targets to soil sample beneath the “mbuga” cover.

Singida Gold Project
Company personnel first visited the Singida project area during March, 2009 and became aware of the high level of artisanal (small scale) gold mining that was being conducted along an estimated five (5) kilometer mineralized zone. Subsequently, on May 15, 2009, the Company signed a Mineral Financing Agreement with one director of the Company authorizing him, on behalf of the Company, to acquire Primary Mining Licenses (“PMLs”) in the Singida area. As of February 7, 2011, this director has entered into Mineral Properties Sales and Purchase agreements and addendums with various PML owners to acquire PMLs in the Singida area. As of March 31, 2013, the Company has 100% acquired 23 PMLs and 20 PMLs with net smelter production royalty payments. These PMLs have been 100 percent acquired by this director on behalf of the Company. As of March 31, 2013, under the terms of the mineral properties sales and purchase agreements we have completed option payments in the amount of $2,058,322. On February 8, 2013, we issued a notice of the final buyout payment of 20 PMLs to the Singida PMLs owners. The payment will be made in a form of a 2% Net Smelter Production royalty. The Company also agreed to increase the royalty by 1% to 3% if commercial production is delayed beyond March 2015.
We commenced a Phase 2 Reverse Circulation drilling program in March 2011, centered at the Sambaru 2, 3, 4 and 5 Prospects as well as exploring a number of exploration targets within the Singida-Londoni northwest trending shear zone at Sambaru 5 and between Sambaru 3 and Sambaru 4 in which 92 boreholes, totaling 9,023 meters have been drilled. All boreholes, collared along northeast trending drill fences, are inclined at -50 degrees to -65 degrees either to the northeast or to the southwest. Total meters drilled in both Phase 1 (August 2010) and Phase 2 drill programmes amounts to 15,536 meters (Map 9).
No exploration has been undertaken between March 2012 and 31st March 2013
Map 9: Plan of the Sambaru Prospects showing main gold intersections
Future exploration
An evaluation of the Reverse Circulation drill results for both Phase 1 and 2 programs undertaken during 2010 and 2011 has shown that gold mineralization at the Singida-Londoni project consists of narrow, medium to low grade and often discontinuous lenses. The shear structures hosting the gold-rich zones typically “pinch and swell” along strike, which in places, has resulted in larger pods of limited size as at Sambaru 3 and Sambaru 4 which indicates that the gold deposits have limited potential to be developed into a major ore resource contrary to the Company’s vision of discovering substantially larger and economically viable gold deposits in the short term. In this regard, the Company believes that the nature and extent of the mineralization revealed thus far may lend itself towards a small-scale commercial mining operation. The Company intends to explore the possibilities of undertaking a small scale mining operation on a number of PMLs once a scoping study has been completed.
Although the Company completed a Technical report in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 prior to the June 2010 revised code, it was not submitted. The report is to be prepared under the revised guidelines.
Buhemba Gold Projects
The Buhemba Gold projects comprise of the Kiabakari East (PL7142/2007) and the recently acquired Maji Moto (HQ-P23869) licenses.
Kiabakari East (PL7142/2011)
The Kiabakari East Project is located approximately 55 kilometers southeast of Musoma town, in the Mara Region. The PL, covering 14.94 square kilometers and lying within the central part of the Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt, was granted to Lake Victoria Resources by the Ministry of Mines in April 2011.
The PL was previously investigated by Randgold Resources who excavated a number of N-S trenches across a small hill, rising some 50 meters above the landscape, comprised of Banded Iron Formation (BIF Hill) rocks in the central to southern part of the PL. They also undertook 3 N-S drill fences, totaling 24 reverse circulation drill holes, along strike to the east of the BIF hill. No information is currently available. Minor artisanal mining activities are present on the BIF hill. The eastern part of the license at the Kyarano Prospect was invaded by + 500 artisanal miners during 2011 who exposed a NNE-SSW trending gold bearing structure hosted by a quartz porphyry dyke within a metasedimentary rock sequence. Mining activities have subsequently been reduced due to ground water problems and underground cave-ins.
Exploration Strategy
The following exploration work has been completed across the Kiabakari East License:
Landsat Imagery for the license area and surrounding environs.
Detailed mapping
Trenching (342.7 meters) including the re-opening of existing trenches as well as new trenches were mapped and sampled across BIF Hill. Notable results include but are not limited to 1.87g/t gold over 33.69 meters as shown in Table 5.
Regional geological mapping
In-house ground magnetic surveying along 200 meter spaced N-S traverse lines
In-house Gradient IP Survey was undertaken along the same grid as used for the ground magnetic survey
Regional rock sampling of specific localities on the PL
Termite mound sampling
Soil sampling - regional sampling on 200 meter x 50 meter centers utilizing the geophysics grid
Schlumberger Survey- Schlumberger VES on N-S and E-W profiles were undertaken across BIF Hill and the artisanal workings at the Kyarano Prospect respectively (Table 6, Map 10).
Four inclined diamond drill holes, amounting to 648.72 meters, were collared on the southern side of BIF Hill on 40 meter spaced N-S drill fences and drilled to the north at declinations of 50 and 55 degrees to test and define the geometry of the BIF hosted gold mineralization (Table 7). All boreholes intersected wide zones of anomalous gold mineralization including
1.03 g/t gold over 37.50 meters and 0.58g/t Au over 43.35 meters, inclusive of higher grade intersections of 1.75 g/t gold over 6.13 meters and 2.05 g/t over 3.00 meters (Table 8)

*Significant IP anomalies
Inconsistent IP results were noted from the surveys undertaken across the Kyarano workings which failed to distinguish the pyritized quartz porphyry rock.
A distinct chargeability with low resistivity, situated some 100 meters north of the interpolated strike extensions of the mineralised BIF unit, was noted from a number of E-W Schlumberger profiles undertaken across BIF Hill (Table 6).
Map 10: Plan of BIF Hill and Kyarano Prospects showing position of Schlumberger profiles and diamond drill collars
Diamond drilling
A total of 4 inclined diamond drill holes, amounting to 648.72 meters, was collared on the southern side of BIF Hill on 40 meter spaced N-S drill fences and drilled to the north at declinations of 50 and 55 degrees to test and define the geometry of the BIF hosted gold mineralization, comprising of chert, siltstone and greywackes (Table 7).
Table 7: Diamond Drill Programme
Each borehole was drilled across the BIF package of rocks comprising of cyclic sequences of siltstone and banded cherts having an overall width of 80 meters, until the footwall pebble conglomerate unit was encountered on the northern side of the hill. The BIF unit dips steeply to the south. Occasional intraformational sedimentary slump breccias are stratigraphically present. The unit has been complexly folded. A possible NNE trending fault is present which appears to have displaced the eastern part of the ore shoot some 40 meters to the north as well as being responsible for down-throwing the BIF unit to the east (Map 11).
Map 11: Plan of BIF Hill showing results of trench and drill holes and interpolated position of NNE fault.
Massive sulphides, consisting of syngenetic magnetite and pyrrhotite-rich bands occur throughout the BIF unit. Crackle brecciation and fracturing is more common in the brittle chert beds which are often infilled with later pyrrhotite and/or pyrite mineralization. Gold is associated with the sulphide filled fractures as well as within zones of massive pyrite and, to a lesser extent, massive pyrrhotite mineralization.
All the core was cut in half by a rock saw with the half core (or quarter core if over wider intervals of >1 meter) being sampled according to the intervals as per geologic log. Strict quality control has been maintained in which 5 percent of the sample batch, comprising 20 samples, contained a blank, a Commercial Standard and a duplicate. The samples batches were submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for 50gm Fire assay.
Results
The limited drill programme of 648.72 meters intersected wide zones of anomalous gold mineralization throughout all four boreholes drilled including 1.03 g/t gold over 37.50 meters and 0.58g/t Au over 43.35 meters, inclusive of higher grade intersections of 1.75 g/t gold over 6.13 meters and 2.05 g/t over 3.00 meters. Mineralized intercepts are summarized in Table 8 below.
Table 8: Summary of Diamond drill intercepts
The gold mineralization, having been offset by the NNE fault, plunges steeply to the east. Anomalous gold mineralization of greater than 250 ppb gold was encountered over substantial widths in each of the boreholes with improved grades being intersected in the deeper hole (KED004) drilled to the east. Mineralization is open down dip and along strike both to the west and down plunge to the east (Map 12).

Kyarano Prospect
The Kyarano Prospect, located on the eastern side of the Kiabakari East Permit, is a recent artisanal site in which, at one time, up to +500 illegal miners have been active. Shafts, aligned along a NNE trend were sunk into a quartz porphyry/felsite “dyke” rock for a strike distance of some 400 meters. Mining activities decreased as flooding of the shafts occurred from 15-20 meters below ground. A number of the shafts were sampled and assayed for gold by 50 gm fire assay, results of which are shown in Table 9 and Map 10.

Diamond drilling
A short drilling programme was initially planned to test the NNE trending pyritic quartz felsite porphyry at the Kyarano Prospect located on the eastern side of the project area some1.5 kilometers east of BIF Hill. Two boreholes, collared 240 meters apart on E-W drill fences (Table 7) were to test the area 80 meters beneath the active artisanal workings in order to examine the hosting lithologies and alteration associated with this known gold mineralisation. However, due to budget constraints, the two diamond drill holes were not drilled.
NW Prospect
A number of old trenches were discovered in the northwestern corner of the licence immediately south of the granite - greenstone contact (Map 13).
Map 13: Aerial photograph of the trench excavations undertaken by Rand Gold in the NW part of the Kibakari East Licence (after Google Earth).
The area is underlain by BIF rocks comprising of chert and siltstone rocks. It is cut by a N-S trending quartz diorite dyke. Two areas of artisanal mining have exposed highly oxidized and leached sulphidic zones within the BIF rocks. A number of grab samples were collected and Fire assayed for gold by SGS Laboratories Mwanza (Table 10).

Metallurgical test work is to be undertaken on the oxide rock material taken from artisanal working and trenches on surface as part of the scoping study to determine the viability of commencing and open pit/underground small scale mining operation at BIF Hill. In order to get a better understanding of the geology and gold mineralisation, the Company is considering developing a north trending adit form the southern side at the base of the hill at a later date.
Maji Moto Gold Project (HQ-P23869)
A recent acquisition to the North Mara group of licences is the Maji Moto licence that was awarded to the Company by the Ministry of Mines through application and tender in April 2012. The licence is situated in the North Mara Greenstone Belt (Eastern Musoma Goldfields) approximately 28 kilometers to the SW of African Barrick’s North Mara Gold Mine (Map 14).
Map 14: Location map of Maji Moto HQ-P23869
Note: HQ-O23869 is the Application number. The licence has yet to be allocated a PL number by the Ministry.
Artisanal workings:
Three artisanal sites are present in the northern part of the licence (Map 15):
1.
Located at Kitarahota Hill, some 2 kilometres east of Maji Moto village is actively being mined by a relatively small group of artisanal miners. The site, located on the lower slope of the Kitarahota Hill, consists mostly of surface workings.
2.
Nyamarubiti Hill, located in the north-eastern arm of the licence was an active artisanal site in 1980s and is only being worked sporadically by a handful of artisanal miners.
3.
Kebosi Hill, situated on the NW arm of the PL and east of the much larger Kitengara Hill. This site does not appear to be as extensively mined as site 2 and is currently not being mined by artisanal miners.
Map 15: Geology of HQ-P23869
Other than a reconnaissance visit to the licence, exploration has not yet commenced.
The following exploration strategy (Phase 1) will be followed as soon as a field camp is established on site:
Regional ground Magnetic survey
Regional mapping of the licence
Regional soil sampling on 200 meter x 50 meter sample grid
Detailed mapping and soil/rock sampling at and around the artisanal sites
Schlumberger profiles across the known artisanal sites.
Phase 2 will be dependant on the results achieved from the Phase 1 exploration programme.
Uyowa Gold Project
The Uyowa Gold project, located 120 kilometers northwest of Tabora town, previously consisted of seven (7) Prospecting Licenses (PLs) that initially covered a total area of 729.73 square kilometers in the west-central area of Tanzania. Due to increased Ministerial costs of annual renewals coupled with the Company’s objective to focus its exploration efforts on more potentially viable ground holding, the number of licenses has been reduced to 4 PLs amounting to 328.47 square kilometers (Table 1, Map 16).
Map 16: Current licence holdings of the Uyowa Project
Exploration
Exploration has been primarily focused in the northern license blocks PL 3425/2007 (since relinquished) and PL5153/2008 of Target 3. PL5153/2008 was previously investigated by Ashanti Gold in 2003, in which they undertook 999 meters of Reverse Circulation drilling. The area is now an active artisanal mining site. The following work has been undertaken on PL 5153/2007 (Map 17) since exploration commenced from March 2011 through to 31st March 2013.

Termite mound sampling
Soil and termite mound sampling - on 200 meter x 50 meter grid totaling 2616 samples. All the anomalous gold values occur as single point values along the known E-W zone of gold mineralization. A single maximum value of 400 ppb gold occurs on the far eastern side of the trend (Map 18).
Shaft sampling
A total of 29 reverse circulation drill holes, amounting to 2,486 meters, was drilled to test the down-dip continuity of thickness and grade as well as exploring the strike extensions of the 4 main mineralized zones across the PMLs, was completed in September 2011 (Map 19). Notable results to date include: 17.6 g/t over 6 meters, 7.95 g/t Au over 9 meters, 4.1 g/t over 10 meters and 10.41 g/t over 3 meters inclusive of a number of significant 1 meter intervals of 103 g/t Au, 33 g/t Au and 24 g/t Au respectively.
A total of 11 diamond drill holes, amounting to 1459 meters, aimed at defining and understanding the structural controls of the 4 gold veins across 300 meters of strike length within the central to western parts of the 1700 meter long E-W shear zone, was undertaken from March to May 2012 (Map 20). Gold mineralization was traced to a vertical depth of some 150 meters. Notable results include: 27.3 g/t Au over 0.40 meters, 16.3g/t over 0.35 meters, 3.05g/t Au over 4 meters and 2.21 g/t Au over 6 meters

Diamond drilling
The 1459 meter diamond drill program, primarily aimed at defining and understanding the structural controls of the 4 gold veins across 300 meters of strike length within the central to western parts of the1700 meter long E-W shear zone, was undertaken from March to May 2012. The 11 hole program, planned on 40 meter spaced N-S sections, also tested the down-dip extensions of mineralization to a vertical depth of some 150 meters. A total of 1459 meters was drilled in 11 boreholes (Table 11, Map 21 ).
Table 11: Diamond drill programme
Map 21: Diamond drill collar plan
Drilling has revealed that the gold mineralization is hosted by a number of semi-continuous ductile shears zones of up to 7 meters wide and containing disseminated pyrite mineralization, dipping between 55 to 70 degrees to the north. In all sections, the mineralized gold zones have been traced to vertical depths of 100 meters and are open at depth.
A “twin” hole was drilled to compare the gold grades and widths in order to increase gold grade confidence of the previous RC drilling results and to work towards establishing a gold resource.
A single diamond drill hole was drilled at either end of the known mineralized zone, confirming the presence of the mineralized shear zone continuing out along strike both to the east and to the west.
All borehole samples across the mineralized zones were split, sampled and analysed using 50 gm Fire assay by SGS Laboratories Mwanza. Strict quality control was maintained throughout the sampling procedure with 5 percent of each of the sample batches having a blank, duplicate and commercial standard inserted as part of the sample stream.
Results
Notable results including 27.3 g/t Au over 0.40 meters, 16.3g/t over 0.35 meters, 3.05g/t Au over 4 meters and 2.21 g/t Au over 6 meters, are shown in Table 12.
Table 12: Summary of Diamond Drill intercepts
Drilling successfully intersected the mineralized lenses as identified from the RC drill program of August 2011. Diamond drilling has further defined the geometry of the mineralized zones comprised of 2 gold lenses, situated approximately 25 meters apart, dipping moderately to the north at 65 degrees. The dip of the 2 lenses steepens to 75 degrees further along strike to the east (Map 20). The southern lens is the more dominant of the two gold structures in having both a higher gold grade and a more continuous strike length. Gold mineralization is hosted by pyrite within narrow ductile shear zones having a maximum intersected width of 7.8 meters.
The distribution of gold in Lens 2 suggests that there are 3, equally spaced gold “shoots” of approximately 80 meters broad plunging at 30 degrees to the west which are open at depth (Map 22). A left lateral fault on the western side of the main drilling target has offset the strike of the lenses by some 100 meters. Some of the highest grade gold intercepts, which have been reported from drilling, occur in the western shoot. The central and eastern ore shoots appear to have lower overall gold grades and narrower intercepts.

Future exploration
Interpretation of the ground magnetic survey suggests the presence of a graben structure that coincides with the last of the artisanal workings on the western side of known mineralized zone. The area, unlike the artisanal site where laterite is often exposed on surface, is overlain by sand cover for some 500 meters to the west before lateritic soils are again present suggesting possible continuation of the mineralized trend further to the west. Landsat imagery clearly shows areas of laterite and lateritic soil over the area. Based on the recent soil geochemistry results, follow up specific soil sampling is planned across the interpolated trend of gold mineralization to both the west and east of the artisanal workings covering a total strike length of 3.5 kilometers as shown in Map 23.
Conventional soil sampling is planned across areas of lateritic soil cover. Initially a RAB program is recommended to test the intervening areas covered by black cotton soil (“mbuga’). However, prior to embarking on such a program, an orientation survey using enzyme geochemistry is recommended as a trial study over a portion of the area to be sampled. Should results be positive further sampling incorporating this geochemical method will continue to be used to outline the gold anomaly.
Follow-up investigation using possibly both methods of soil sampling will be undertaken across a number of ground magnetic targets (Map 24) in order to prioritize targets for later testing by RAB drilling.
Reverse Circulation infill drilling is recommended on 40 meter spaced N-S sections across the artisanal site in order to undertake a resource calculation. Furthermore, part of the program will also focus on testing the soil anomaly along strike.

Handeni Gold Project
The Handeni Project, initially comprised of three (3) Prospecting Licenses and covering a total area of 200.59 square kilometers (Table 13), is located approximately 240 kilometers by road north-west of Dar es Salaam and some 30 kilometers south of Handeni town within the Handeni District (Map 25). Subsequent exploration has resulted in both the Amani (PL7002/2011) and the Mkulima East (PL7148/2011) licenses being relinquished and the properties have been returned to their prospective owners. The Company has retained 100% of the mineral rights of the remaining PL4816/2007.

Exploration
No exploration was undertaken on the Handeni Project during the year. A brief summary of the status of proposed future exploration PL4816/2007 is given:
Future exploration
An infill soil sampling programme on 100 meter x 25 meter grid is recommended across the Mkulima Hill (188 samples) in order to better define the apparent gold anomalies prior to planning a trenching programme across the main anomalous zones (Map 26). Should a trenching programme be warranted, further soil sampling on 100 meter x 50 meter grid is proposed around the hill on 200 meter x 50 meter grid (623 samples) to increase the area of investigation and strike extend of the gold anomalies (Table 14 , Map 26).

Kahama Project
Kahama South (PL6437/2011)
The Kahama South Project area is situated approximately 35 kilometres south of the town of Kahama in the central part of Tanzania. It covers an area of 183.05 square kilometres within the Kahama Greenstone Belt.
Exploration
Regional exploration has been conducted across the licence, together with the adjoining licence (PL6341/2010) to the north that has since been relinquished (Map 27), and includes:
Regional mapping
Ground Magnetic survey
Map 27: Location and geology map of the Kahama South Project
The Ground Magnetic survey was undertaken along 400 meter-spaced north-south traverse lines and covered a total of 615 line kilometers (Map 28).
Map 28: Ground Magnetic survey coverage of the Kahama South Licence
Results
Interpretation of the Ground Magnetic survey is shown in Map 29. The eastern part of prospect comprises of a high magnetic north-south trending “horst block” comprising of biotite-rich granite. Similar north-south grabens are interpolated to be present on the western side of the licence. These major structures appear to have been later displaced by NW-SE as well as NE-SW faults that cut across the licence.
Reconnaissance mapping
The area is largely covered by black cotton soil (“mbuga” clay). Outcrop, when present consists entirely of granitoid rocks, partly magnetized, with minor pegmatite development in places (Map 30).
No recent or past artisanal mining activities were found within the prospect. However, a small area of artisanal mining is being carried on some 100 meters to 200 meters from the SW corner of the licence along a SE-SW trending ridge. The geology of the ridge, unlike that found over the licence, is dominated by surface laterite, BIF, metasediments and metavolcanic rocks. And is similar to the geology of Nyang’ombe hills located some 2 kilometres from the western boundary licence.

Kahama Shinyanga (PL3439/2005).
The Kahama Shinyanga project (PL 3539/2005) is located in central to northern Tanzania, is about 130 kilometers north from the Kahama South Project,110 kilometers northwest of the town of Shinyanga and 50 kilometers southeast from Bulyanhulu Mine. The licence area covers 48 square kilometers.
A brief period of exploration involving ground magnetic surveys and regional mapping was conducted before the licence was relinquished in June 2012.
Exploration
The area is typically flat lying area and is largely covered by "mbuga". A ground magnetic survey was undertaken along 200 meter-spaced N-S traverse lines concurrently with field mapping in which a total of 233 traverse line kilometers were surveyed (Map 31).
Map 31: Ground Magnetic survey coverage across the Kahama Shinyanga PL.
A prominent magnetic anomaly is present in the SW corner of the permit which was found to be the result of a unit of Banded Iron Formation striking NE across the licence. This has been cut by a NNW trending dyke. Similar north-trending dykes are shown in the western part of the licence (Map 32).
Map 32: Total Horizontal Gradient
The geology of the Kahama Shinyanga project is underlain by Archaean rocks of the Kahama Greenstone belt and comprise of granites, meta-volcanics and sedimentary rocks including BIF which crops out on Kalunde hill in the SE part of the licence. Laterites, partially cementing the BIF are present on the lower slopes of Kalunde Hill. No active artisanal mining is present on the licence although previous pitting has been noted in the BIF on Kalunde Hill. Active mining is being carried out approximately 200 meters south of the licence boundary at Mahiga and at Namba Tano (Map 33) in the western part of the area.
Map 33: Geology map of the Kahama Shinyanga Licence
Future exploration
With little to no artisanal gold mining being undertaken on the licence and the apparent lack of prominent shear zones cutting through the BIF, the prospectivity of the licence is considered low. When the licence expired and came up for renewal, it was decided to relinquish it and return it back to the Ministry of Mines in June 2012.
North Mara Gold Projects
The North Mara Gold Project, now comprising of 4 Prospecting licences and covering 274.83 square kilometers (Table 1 & Map 1), has been divided into 2 blocks, namely the Tarime-Utegi and the Kubiasi Kiserya project which includes the Kiagata Project. Six of the 10 licences previously held by the Company have been relinquished after reconnaissance exploration indicated poor potential to discover an economic resource within the near future. Minor, or lack thereof, of artisanal activity is evident on these licences.
No exploration activities were undertaken on any of the licences during the last fiscal year.
Tarime & Utegi
The remaining Tarime PL4882/2005, Utegi PL4873/2007 and Kiagata PL4225/2007 licences, from a previous 6 PLs are located on the western side of the North Mara Greenstone Belt. Since much of the area is overlain by “mbuga” soils, target generation was undertaken by detailed structural analysis of both Magnetic and IP data. The detailed aeromagnetic survey data, undertaken by the Finnish Geological Survey (2003), was purchased from the Government and processed. A number of magnetically interpreted structural targets have been delineated for field investigation. Both licences are considered of low priority.
Kiagata
The Kiagata project (PL4225/2007), located within the North Mara Greenstone belt, is situated in the Musoma District and is about 30 kilometers from Musoma Town, the main commercial hub in the area. The project is located immediately south of the Mara River and west of the Serengeti National Park. A reconnaissance survey involving mapping, termite mound sampling, and selected soil and rock sampling were carried out but results suggest that no gold mineralization is present on the property. The licence is underlain by barren granitic rocks. The licence is to be relinquished.
Future Exploration
Previous interpretation of the aero-magnetic data revealed a number of targets defined by deep-seated cross-cutting structures. However no artisanal workings, indicative of gold are present on the licence. Much of the area is overlain by “mbuga” clay. The potential to discover a gold resource in the immediate future is considered low. On account of austerity measures and the need to focus on a number of key projects within the Company’s portfolio, these licences are expected to be relinquished as soon as the rental term expires. No further work is to be undertaken on the licences.
Uranium Projects
The Company currently holds 6 Prospecting licences for Uranium, located in the SW part of Tanzania and covering 803 square kilometers (Table 2 & Map 2). Due to the economic downturn on Uranium exploration coupled with the Company’s intention to stream line its gold portfolio, these licences will be relinquished once their rental term expires.
