SILVER AND GOLD MINING PROPERTIES
The Company’s operating segments include Palmarejo (Mexico), San Bartolomé (Bolivia), Kensington (Alaska, USA), Rochester (Nevada, USA), Martha (Argentina), and Endeavor (New South Wales, Australia). See Note 22- Segment Reporting in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information relating to its business segments and its domestic and export sales.
Mexico - Palmarejo
The Palmarejo surface and underground silver and gold mine, and associated milling operation, owned and operated by Coeur Mexicana, is located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Access to the property is provided by air, rail, and all-weather paved and gravel roads from the state capitol of Chihuahua.
For the full year ended 2012, Palmarejo produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold, compared to 9.0 million ounces of silver and 125,071 ounces of gold in 2011. Cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce of silver for 2012 were both $1.33. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs." Metal sales in 2012 from Palmarejo totaled $442.1 million, or 49% of the Company's total metal sales, compared with $513.1 million, or 50% of the Company's total metal sales in 2011. Sales of silver totaled $261.5 million and sales from gold were $180.6 million. Production costs in 2012 totaled $197.5 million while depreciation and depletion expense was $146.6 million. Total capital expenditures in 2012 were $38.5 million.
The low costs per silver ounce are due in part to significant by-product credits from gold production and an increase in price over the last three years. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, gold by-product credits were approximately, $21.40, $21.83 and $21.50 per silver ounce, respectively, and were deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs
per ounce. If the Company's accounting policy had been changed to treat gold production as a co-product, the following total cash costs per ounce would have been reported:
The Company’s property position at Palmarejo is large, consisting of contiguous mining concessions totaling 30,278 acres (12,253 hectares or 47 square miles) in size located in the south east part of the state of Chihuahua. Of the total concessions, 32 concessions consisting of 47 square miles (12,204 hectares) are owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana, formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), and the remaining three concessions, representing 0.19 square miles (48.77 hectares) are partially owned (50 to 60%) by Coeur Mexicana. All of the Company’s ore reserves are located on concessions owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana. All concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until at least 2029. In addition to Palmarejo, the Company also controls 21,016 acres (8,505 hectares) of concessions at the Yécora exploration-stage property located in the state of Sonora, near the border with Chihuahua, and 17,717 acres (7,170 hectares) of concessions at the La Guitarra exploration-stage property in Chihuahua, south-east of Palmarejo.
All property and equipment are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility as well as by generators. Water is supplied to the property by pipeline from the Chinipas River and also from recycled process water collected at the site.
Commercial production commenced in April 2009. Recovery of gold has been consistent with the initial metallurgical test work and feasibility study estimates and averaged 94.4% during 2012, up from 92.2% in 2011. The recovery of silver averaged 83% during 2012, which was below feasibility study estimates, but up from 76.4% in 2011. Although the Company will continue pursuing adjustments to the plant to increase silver recovery rates, as of December 31, 2012, it expects silver recoveries to average 84% for 2013. The Company is researching opportunities to achieve further improvements going forward.
The Palmarejo mine is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest-trending Sierra Madre Occidental is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau, cut by numerous igneous intrusive rocks. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo mine area, locally forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico.
The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo mine, typical of many of the other silver and gold deposits in the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias and fractures. These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on the structures ranges from about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures gold and silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit and higher gold values in the lower parts, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization, though local variations are common. The Palmarejo property contains a number of mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the north of the concessions which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine formed at the intersection of the northwest-southeast trending La Prieta and La Blanca gold-and-silver bearing structures. In addition to Palmarejo, other mineralized vein and alteration systems in the district area have been identified all roughly sub-parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including Animas) and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property which are currently under development and exploration by the Company.
The Company spent $19.9 million in the Palmarejo district in 2012 to discover new silver and gold mineralization and define new ore reserves. This program consisted of drilling 341,975 feet (104,234 meters) of core. The exploration budget for Palmarejo for 2013 is $15.8 million.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - Palmarejo Mine
Year-end Mineralized Material - Palmarejo Mine
Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2012. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $27.50 per ounce of silver and $1,450 per ounce of gold.
(2)
The ore reserves are underground and open pit mineable and include an allowance for mining dilution and recovery. For the underground-mineable reserves, the dilution and mining recovery is incorporated into the detailed design of each stope for the Palmarejo mine; a 10% dilution at a grade of 0.62 g/t Au and 54 g/t Ag and 100% mining recovery was used for the Guadalupe deposit. For the open pit-minable reserves, the mining dilution and mining recovery was incorporated into a block diluted model for the Palmarejo mine. No open pit reserves are included for the Guadalupe deposit at this time.
(3)
Metallurgical recovery factors of 93% for gold and 63% to 80% for silver were used in estimations for ore reserves for Palmarejo and should be applied to the contained reserve ounces.
(4)
The ore reserves and mineralized material estimates were prepared by W. Orr (Manager of Corporate Technical Services) and the Company’s technical staff with the assistance of an independent consulting firm.
(5)
For the part of the Palmarejo Mine currently in production in surface and underground mining, the proven and probable reserves are defined above an economic cut-off grade demonstrating grade continuity delineated by exploration and definition drill holes with a nominal grid spacing of 15 meters to 45 meters, depending on resource area. Proven reserves is material at a distance of less than or equal to 15 meters from the nearest composite sample with a minimum of two drill holes used in the grade estimate. Probable reserves are defined by distance to the nearest composite sample of between 15 meters and 45 meters and a minimum of two drill holes used in the grade estimate. For the Guadalupe deposit, being developed for underground mining, the proven and probable reserves are defined as mineralized material above an economic cut-off grade demonstrating grade continuity delineated by at least two exploration drill holes within less than 65 meters of each other. Proven reserves were selected from resource areas with average drill hole spacing of 20 meters to less than 35 meters and a minimum of two drill holes used in the grade estimate. The current proven reserve blocks are at an average distance of 12 meters from the nearest composite sample (45 meters maximum), have an average of 4 octants informed for the estimates and were informed by an average of 8 drill holes. Probable reserves were selected from resource areas with average drill hole spacing of 35 meters to less than 80 meters. Probable reserves were further defined by distance to the nearest composite sample of less than approximately 65 meters and a minimum of two drill holes used in the grade estimate. The current probable reserve blocks are at an average of 18 meters from the nearest drill hole (102 meters maximum), have an average of 4 octants informed for the estimates and were informed by an average of 8 drill holes. Mineralized material is similarly classified.

Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs.”
Bolivia - San Bartolomé
The San Bartolomé open pit silver mine, and associated milling operation, operated by Empresa Minera Manquiri SA (“Manquiri”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico Mountain bordering the town of Potosí, in the department of Potosí, Bolivia. Access to the property and the Company’s processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potosí.
Silver production for 2012 was 5.9 million ounces compared to 7.5 million ounces in 2011. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2012 were $11.76 per ounce compared to $9.10 per ounce in 2011. Total cash costs per ounce (which includes production taxes and royalties) for 2012 were $12.95 per ounce compared to $10.64 per ounce in 2011. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs." Metal sales in 2012 were $178.0 million, representing 20% of the Company’s total metal sales. One hundred percent of these sales were derived from silver. Production costs in 2012 totaled $71.4 million and depreciation and depletion expense was $16.7 million. Total capital expenditures in 2012 were $25.7 million.
Coeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (“ASARCO”) on September 9, 1999. Construction activities commenced in 2004. Manquiri’s principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolomé mine. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolomé.
The Company completed feasibility studies in 2000 and 2004, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually.
The property, plant and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventative maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility. Water is supplied to the property by a public water source.
The Bolivian tax rate on most mining companies is 37.5%. However, mining companies that produce a doré product, as the San Bartolomé mine does, will receive a 5% credit based upon their specific operation. Thus, the tax rate for San Bartolomé is 32.5%.
The Company obtained political risk insurance policies from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (“OPIC”) and another private insurer and is self-insured for $23.3 million. The combined policies are in the amount of $155.0 million and cover Coeur up to the lesser of $131.8 million or 85.0% of any loss arising from expropriation, political violence or currency inconvertibility. The policy costs were capitalized during the development and construction phases and are now included as a cost of inventory produced over the term of the policies which expire in 2019 and 2024.
The silver mineralization at San Bartolomé is hosted in unconsolidated sediments (pallacos) and reworked sediments (sucus and troceras) and oxide stockpiles and dumps (desmontes) from past mining that occurred on the flanks of Cerro Rico. Cerro Rico is a prominent mountain in the region that reaches an elevation of over 15,400 feet (over 4,700 meters). It is composed of Tertiary-aged volcanic and intrusive rocks that were emplaced into and over older sedimentary, and volcanic, basement rocks. Silver, along with tin and base metals, is located in multiple veins and vein swarms and stockworks that occur in a northeast trending belt which transects Cerro Rico. The upper parts of the Cerro Rico mineralized system were subsequently eroded and re-deposited into the flanking gravel deposits. Silver is hosted in all portions of the pallacos, sucus, and troceras with the best grades segregated to the coarser-grained silicified fragments. These deposits lend themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. Of the several pallaco deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo and Santa Rita.
The mineral rights for the San Bartolomé mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian state-owned mining organization COMIBOL. Manquiri controls 47.93 square kilometers (11,578 acres) of land at San Bartolomé around Cerro Rico under contracts and concessions and approximately 37.45 square kilometers (8.95 acres) of concessions at the Rio Blanco property, a gold exploration target south of Potosí. The San Bartolomé lease agreements expire between 2021 and 2028 and are generally subject to a production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. The royalty rate is 3% at silver prices below $4 per ounce and 6% at prices above $8 per ounce. The rate is a factor of 75% of the silver price between $4 and $8. The Company has additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The Company incurred royalty payment obligations to COMIBOL and the Cooperatives for these mining rights totaling $7.1 million and $11.6 million for the years ended 2012 and 2011, respectively.
On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining company, Corporación Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”), announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of the Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with which the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur. Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed mining operations at the San Bartolomé mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur. Mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level continue to be suspended. The partial suspension may reduce production until the Company is able to resume mining above 4,400 meters generally. It is uncertain at this time how long the suspension will remain in place. In addition, it is possible that COMIBOL may decide that the Company's operations at the Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur are subject to the COMIBOL resolution, which may force the Company to cease mining at such deposits. If COMIBOL objects to the Company mining at the Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur or if the other restrictions are not lifted, it may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia. Access to the Huacajchi deposit and its higher grade material is having beneficial effect on production and cost at the mine. The Company does not use explosives in its surface-only mining activities and is sensitive to the preservation of the mountain under its contracts with the state-owned mining entity and the local cooperatives.
In 2012, exploration trenching and sampling was performed at San Bartolomé to expand the ore reserves. This program cost $0.4 million and 4,288 feet (1,307 meters) of trenching was accomplished and sampled in 2012. A similar program is planned for 2013 at an estimated cost of $0.6 million.

Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2012. The metal price used for current ore reserves was $27.50 per ounce of silver.
(2)
Ore reserves are open pit-minable and include a mining recovery such that 15 cm buffer of ore material above the bedrock was excluded from the reserve; this equates to a mining recovery of 99.0%. Metallurgical recovery factors of 77% to 86% were used in estimations for ore reserves for San Bartolomé and should be applied to the contained reserve ounces.
(3)
Ore reserves and mineralized material estimates were prepared by W. Orr (Manager of Corporate Technical Services) and the Company’s technical staff with the assistance of an independent consulting firm.
(4)
Proven and probable ore reserves are defined by surface drill holes, trenches, and pits (pozos) with an average spacing of no more than 230 feet (70 meters). Proven reserves are those reserves in stockpile as of December 31, 2012. The grade of ore reserve block is determined by the grade of proximal drill hole and/or pit composites and three-dimensional models of geologic controls. A minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 composite were used to classify proven and probable ore reserves and variable geostatistical estimation variances. Mineralized Material is similarly classified.

USA - Alaska-Kensington Mine
The Kensington underground gold mine and associated milling facilities are located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington mine commenced commercial production on July 3, 2010. The mine is accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilizes conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. Ore is processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which is sold to third party smelters. Waste material is deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied to the site by on-site diesel generators. Access to the project is by either a combination of road vehicles, boat, helicopter, float plane, or by boat direct from Juneau.
Production at Kensington was 82,125 ounces of gold in 2012. Metal sales in 2012 at Kensington were $111.0 million, or 12% of total sales. Production costs were $87.1 million and depreciation and depletion expense was $41.6 million. The Company's capital expenditures at the Kensington mine totaled approximately $37.0 million in 2012.
In December of 2011, Kensington entered a six month period where processing levels were reduced by 50% to approximately 700 tons per day. The reduction in ore processing was required to allow work to be completed on several infrastructure projects. This allowed the mine to implement and complete several key initiatives, including:
•
accelerated underground development, resulting in more working faces and greater operational flexibility;
•
large in-fill drilling program to better define the high-grade ore zones and improve the mine plan;
•
completion and commissioning of the underground paste backfill plant and related distribution system, providing access to stopes located in previously mined areas;
•
upgrading and completing construction of several underground and surface facilities; and
•
improving overall safety of the operation.
All initiatives have been completed and the Kensington mine has resumed full production.
Coeur Alaska, Inc., (“Coeur Alaska”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, controls two contiguous land groups: the Kensington and Jualin properties. The Kensington property consists of 51 private patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 768 acres, 294 federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 3,894 acres, and eight State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 96 acres. The Company controls the Jualin Property, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, through the cessation of mining, so long as the Company makes timely payments pursuant to the lease agreement. The Jualin Property consists of 23 patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 381 acres, 438 federal unpatented lode claims and one unpatented mill-site claim covering approximately 8,617 acres, and 17 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 341 acres. The federal and state claims, as well as the private patented lode and mill-site claims, provide Coeur with the necessary rights to mine and process ore from Kensington. All of the Company’s Alaska ore reserves are located within the patented claims. The unpatented claims and mill site are maintained via annual filings and fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which acts as administrator of the claims. State claims are maintained via filings and fees to Alaska Department of Natural Resources - Juneau Recorder’s Office. Real property taxes are paid yearly to the City and Borough of Juneau for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing.
Coeur Alaska is obligated to pay a scaled net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur Alaska recoups the $32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after July 7, 1995 in connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at $400 per ounce gold prices to a maximum of 2.5% at gold prices above $475 per ounce, with the royalty to be capped at 1.0 million ounces of production.
The Kensington ore deposit consists of multiple gold bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate and pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in Cretaceous-aged Jualin diorite. Most of the gold is contained in calaverite (AuTe2) which occurs in association with native gold as inclusions in and interstitial to pyrite grains and in microfractures in pyrite.
The Company spent $4.1 million on exploration at Kensington in 2012, completing 60,666 feet (20,137 meters) of core drilling during the year and plans to spend $9.4 million on exploration in 2013.

USA - Nevada-Rochester Mine
The Rochester mine and associated heap leach facilities is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, which is located approximately 25 miles of paved and all-weather gravel road northeast of the town of Lovelock. The Company owns 100% of the Rochester Mine through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. (“Coeur Rochester”). The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, due south of Rochester.
Production at the Rochester mine in 2012 was approximately 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold, compared to approximately 1.4 million ounces of silver and 6,276 ounces of gold in 2011. Production was higher due to increased ounces recovered from the ore on the new leach pad that was constructed in 2011. Cash operating costs per ounce of silver decreased to $9.62 per ounce in 2012, compared to $22.97 per ounce in 2011. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $11.65 per ounce in 2012 compared to $24.82 per ounce in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in ore produced from the new leach pad. Rochester’s total metal sales in 2012 totaled $132.4 million, or approximately 15% of the Company’s total metal sales. Approximately 59% of Rochester’s metal sales were derived from silver, while 41% were derived from gold. Production costs totaled $74.3 million in 2012 and depreciation and depletion expenses were $8.1 million, compared to $28.3 million and $2.8 million in 2011. The Company’s capital expenditures at the Rochester mine totaled approximately $11.8 million in 2012. The Company plans capital expenditures at the Rochester mine of $32.5 million in 2013, primarily for infrastructure to support further expansion.
The low costs per silver ounce are due in part to significant by-product credits from gold production and an increase in price over the last three years. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, gold by-product credits were approximately, $22.65, $7.11 and $5.81 per silver ounce, respectively, and were deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce. If the Company's accounting policy had been changed to treat gold production as a co-product, the following total cash costs per ounce would have been reported:
Coeur Rochester held 541 U.S. Federal unpatented claims, of which 66 were under lease agreements, and 22 patented claims, totaling approximately 8,600 acres through August 2011. On September 1, 2011, the Company inadvertently missed paying the 2012 assessment year claim maintenance fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and as a result the prior unpatented mining claims were forfeited. In December 2011 and August 2012, the Company located new claims on ground covered by the previous unpatented mining claims, including those subject to lease agreements. The new claims total 516 covering approximately 9,282 acres, and cover the majority of the prior unpatented claim area.
With respect to the claims that were held under lease agreements, the Company has continued to pay lease fees to the lessors according to the rates set forth in the lease agreements. The Company is not currently mining on any of the leased claims, and the Company does not believe these claims to be individually or collectively material to the Company's cash flows or the Rochester property's current plan of operations approved by the BLM. The Company uses the property on which the leased claims are located principally to facilitate access to other portions of the Rochester property and to provide space for infrastructure. None of the lessors has initiated or threatened any litigation against the Company with respect to the leases or the Company's continued use of the lessors' property.
A substantial portion of the new claims is the subject of a legal dispute stemming from competing asserted interests in the claims. A third party asserts that it also staked and filed notices on the Company's original unpatented mining claims and over subsequent new claims that had been previously staked by the Company. The Company believes it holds a superior property interest to the adverse staking party and filed a lawsuit to quiet title in the claims. The mine operates under an approved BLM plan of operations and has continued normal operations while the legal action is pending. The Company believes there will be no impact to the current silver and gold reserves at Coeur Rochester as a result of the claims dispute.
Furthermore, the Company believes that it would retain access to all active mining areas of the Rochester property
notwithstanding an adverse outcome. Because surface access is governed by the approved BLM plan of operations and not by claim ownership, the Company believes that it would retain surface access to all areas of property within the approved BLM plan of operations. However, the Company does believe an adverse outcome would cause it to modify existing plans to further expand future mining operations and would require permits to be updated to reflect changes in claim ownership arising from an adverse outcome. See Note 23 - Litigation and Other Events for information relating to the unpatented mining claims dispute at Rochester.
The claims dispute has not resulted in any changes to the Company's BLM-approved plan of operations for the Rochester property, or any effect on the Company's leaching activities or stockpiles. The Company does not expect any such changes or effects unless the claims dispute is finally resolved against the Company. In the event all claims in dispute were resolved in favor of the adverse party, the Company cannot determine whether any fees or amounts would be awarded to the adverse party for adverse land use, or what the amount or range of such fees or amounts might be. However, the Company would not be subject to BLM fees for any such adverse land use within the BLM-approved plan of operations. The effect on the Company's leaching operations or stockpiles could depend on further BLM proceedings or private negotiations with respect to surface uses of the claims in dispute. The Company estimates that approximately 53,261,000 short tons of mineralized material, averaging 0.46 and 0.003 silver and gold ounces per ton, respectively, is affected by the claim dispute.
On December 20, 2011, the Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining Rye Patch from entering certain active mine areas at the Coeur Rochester mine operation. A map showing the boundary established by the preliminary injunction is filed as Exhibit 99.1 attached to this Form 10-K and available online at http://www.coeur.com/operations/rochester-nevada/rochester-claims-dispute.
The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired its initial interest in the adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003. Very limited mining and processing was conducted at Nevada Packard by the prior owner. Collectively, the Rochester and Nevada Packard properties comprise the Company’s Rochester silver and gold mining and processing operation.
The Rochester mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid, telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office facilities. All of these facilities are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. The mine utilizes the heap leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined using conventional open pit methods.
Gold and silver are recovered by heap leaching of crushed open-pit ore placed on pads located east of the Rochester mining area. Based upon actual operating experience and metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate recovery rates from the crushed ore of 61.0% for silver, depending on the ore being leached, and 92.0% for gold. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for further discussion.
The Company commenced studies to investigate the potential to recommence mining and leaching of new material in 2008 and completed feasibility studies in 2009 and 2010 demonstrating the viability of an expansion of mining and leaching operations at its Rochester mine through 2017. The Company prepared an Amended Plan of Operations for resumption of mining within the existing and permitted Rochester pit and construction of an additional heap leach pad, all within the currently permitted mine boundary. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deemed this plan complete in August 2009 under federal regulations and initiated the National Environmental Policy Act process. The BLM issued a positive Decision Record (DR) for the mine to extend silver and gold mining operations by several years with new production ounces being recovered in the fourth quarter of 2011.
At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, silver-bearing tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein and vein swarms and stockworks) with variable amounts of pyrite.
The Company is obligated to pay a net smelter royalty interest to ASARCO, the prior owner, when the average quarterly market price of silver equals or exceeds $23.60 per ounce indexed for inflation up to a maximum rate of 5%. Royalty expense was $3.5 million, $2.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
In 2012, exploration expenditures of $3.9 million funded 138,121 feet (42,099 meters) of reverse circulation, vibratory rotary (Sonic) and core drilling. The 2013 budget for exploration is $3.5 million.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - Rochester Mine
Year-end Mineralized Material - Rochester Mine
Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are open-pit minable, and in surface stockpiles, effective as of December 31, 2012. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $27.50 per ounce of silver and $1,450 per ounce of gold.
(2)
No factors for mining dilution or recovery are applied to open-pit ore reserves.
(3)
Metallurgical recovery for oxide ore were 61% for silver and 92% for gold. Approximately .08 million tons (3.8%) of sulfide bearing ore is included in the total ore reserves at lower metallurgical recovery rates. However, ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease. Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery, calculated based on the ounces recovered as a percent of the ounces placed on the pad. The ore reserves and mineralized material estimates were estimated by C. Kiel (Superintendent of Rochester Technical Services) and the Company’s technical staff. An independent consulting group reviewed engineering studies and a consulting firm modeled drilling results and updated the estimates of mineralized material.
(4)
Ore reserves are defined by drilling on a grid of 100 feet by 200 feet, or closer, and include open pit mine production sampling to assist with determination of gold and silver grades. The grade is defined by the number of proximal drill-hole composited assay values and three-dimensional geologic controls. The number of drill samples used in estimation of grades must be at least 4 with a maximum search distance of 150 feet at Rochester and 120 feet at Nevada Packard. Mineralized material is similarly classified.
(5)
Mining and crushing operations temporarily terminated in August 2007 and resumed in 2011.
(6)
Includes production taxes and royalties, if applicable.
(7)
Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See "Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs.”
(8)
The Company believes there will be no impact to current silver and gold reserves at Coeur Rochester as a result of the ongoing claims dispute.
(9)
Current mineralized material estimates were determined from within both disputed and undisputed claims and from historic surface stockpiles. While the Company believes it holds a superior position in the ongoing claim dispute, the Company believes an adverse legal outcome would cause it to modify mineralized material estimates.
Argentina - Martha Mine
The Martha underground silver and gold mine, and associated milling operation, owned and operated by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is located in the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina. Access to the property is provided by all-weather gravel roads leading 30 miles northeast of the town of Gobernador Gregores. The Martha mine ceased active mining operations in September 2012. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.
Production at the Martha mine in 2012 was approximately 0.3 million ounces of silver and 257 ounces of gold compared to 0.5 million ounces of silver and 615 ounces of gold in 2011. The 38.9% decrease in silver production was primarily due to a decrease in ore grade in 2012. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2012 were $49.77 per ounce compared to $32.79 per ounce in 2011. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $50.71 in 2012 compared to $34.08 in 2011. The increase in total cash costs per ounce was attributed to the decrease in silver production as compared to 2011. Metal sales in 2012 totaled $13.2 million at Martha. Production costs totaled $17.7 million and depreciation and depletion expenses were $0.7 million, compared with $15.5 million and $0.6 million in 2011. Total capital expenditures at the Martha mine in 2012 were $1.2 million.
The mineral rights for the Martha property are fully-owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Mineral rights owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. in the Santa Cruz Province (excluding Joaquin) total 166 square miles (43,214 hectares) of exploration concessions ("Cateos"), 275 square miles (71,281 hectares) of discovery concessions ("Manifestaciones de Descubrimiento" or "MDs"), and 3.0 square miles (774 hectares) of exploitation concessions ("concesiones de exploitacion"). Martha is centered on the exploitation concessions, which fully cover the area of the mine infrastructure and the ore reserves reported herein. Concessions do not have an expiration date, subject only to required annual fees. Surface rights covering the Martha deposit are controlled by the 137.8 square mile (35,705-hectare) Cerro Primero de Abril Estancia which is owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Included on the estancia is a 60-person camp, mine and exploration offices, and assay laboratory.
The Company acquired the property in 2002 and is obligated to pay a 2.0% net smelter royalty on silver and gold production to Royal Gold Corporation. In addition, the Company is subject to a 3.0% net proceeds royalty payable to the Province of Santa Cruz. The Company incurred royalty expense totaling $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $1.5 million for the years ended 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
The Company operated a 240 tonne per day flotation mill at the site, which produced a flotation concentrate that was shipped to a third-party smelter located in Mexico. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is provided by Company-owned diesel generators.
At Martha, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets within generally sub-horizontal
volcanic rocks of the Jurassic-aged Chon Aike Formation. The veins and veinlets occur as sub-parallel clusters largely trending west-northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy) and native silver.
Exploration at the Martha mine consisted of 10,646 feet (3,245 meters) of core drilling for a total cost of $1.1 million in 2012.

Australia - New South Wales - Endeavor Mine
The Endeavor mine and associated mill facility is an underground silver and base metal operation located in north-central New South Wales, Australia, about 447 miles (720 kilometers) from Sydney. Access to the mine is by paved roads 30 miles (18 kilometers) to the northwest from the community of Cobar.
Production at the Endeavor mine in 2012 was 0.7 million ounces of silver compared to 0.6 million ounces of silver in 2011. The increase in silver production was due to a 6.4% increase in tons milled and a 23.5% increase in ore grades as compared to 2011. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per ounce of silver produced were $17.27 in 2012 compared to $18.87 in 2011. This decrease was due primarily to the increased production.
Metal sales at the Endeavor mine in 2012 were $18.8 million, all of which was derived from silver. Production costs totaled $8.8 million and depreciation and depletion costs were $4.6 million. The Company incurred no capital expenditures at the Endeavor mine in 2012.
The ore reserves at Endeavor are covered by five consolidated mining leases issued by the state of New South Wales to Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”), which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toho Zinc Co. Ltd., a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The leases form a contiguous block of 10,121 acres in size and expire between 2019 and 2027.
The Endeavor mine has been in production since 1983 and is owned and operated by CBH. On May 23, 2005, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (“CDE Australia”), acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine, which is owned and operated by CBH, for $44.0 million including transaction fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25 per ounce is also payable
by CDE Australia in respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007, $2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable silver reserves under the terms of the contract. This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests acquired and is being amortized using the units of production method. The Company is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine.
On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-sharing provision was deferred until such time as CDE Australia had received approximately two million cumulative ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever was later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. The conditions relating to the second payment were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In January 2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on April 1, 2008, plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the modified contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a result of the conversion of portions of the property’s existing inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries near the mine.
The mine employs bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is sold to a third-party smelter. Silver recovery averaged approximately 41.0% in 2012 and 45.0% in 2011. Power to the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local communities. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition by CBH through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required.
At Endeavor, silver, lead, zinc and lesser amounts of copper mineralization are contained within sulfide lenses hosted in fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic-aged Amphitheatre Group. Sulfide lenses are elliptically-shaped, steeply-dipping to the southwest and strike to the northwest. Principal ore minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead- and zinc-rich sulfide zones.
CBH conducts exploration to define new reserves at the mine from both underground and surface core drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, which is the fiscal year used by the operator (CBH), the exploration expenditure at the mine was $0.7 million ($0.7 million AUD). Budgeted exploration for 2013 is approximately $0.4 million ($0.4 million AUD).

NON PRODUCING AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
Joaquin Project - Argentina
The Joaquin silver and gold development project (the "Joaquin Project") is located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina approximately 43 miles (70kms) north of the Company's Martha mine. The property is accessed by all weather dirt roads, leading north-northeast from the town of Gobernador Gregores.
The Joaquin property encompasses over 70,819 acres (28,459 hectares) of exploration concessions ("Cateos") and discover concessions ("MDs").
In November 2006, the Company entered into an exploration and joint venture agreement with Mirasol Resources Ltd., for two properties termed Joaquin and Sascha (under terms of the agreement, the Company terminated its option interest in Sascha). In November 2007, the Company commenced exploration on the Joaquin property. Since that time the Company has defined silver and gold mineralization in two deposits at Joaquin - La Negra and La Morocha - and has recently commenced work on detailed drilling and other technical, economic and environmental programs which it expects will lead to completion of a feasibility study. On December 21, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of the equity interests of Mirasol Argentina SRL in exchange for a total of approximately 1.3 million shares of Coeur common stock valued at $30.0 million, a total cash payment of approximately $30.0 million and assumption of liabilities of $0.1 million. Mirasol Argentina SRL holds the Joaquin silver-gold project in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina. Coeur previously held a 51% interest in the project. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets and not as a business combination since Joaquin is considered to be in the exploration and development stage.
The geology of the Joaquin property consists dominantly of various volcanic rocks of the Jurassic-aged Chon Aike Formation, the host to most of the precious metal deposits discovered to-date in the Santa Cruz province, with lesser amounts of intrusive rocks associated with the Chon Aike Formation. Collectively, the volcanic and intrusive rock units form a prominent geologic domain in the province termed the Deseado Massif. Silver and Gold mineralization at Joaquin occurs in epithermal veins, breccia, stockwork veinlets and mantos within the favorable units of the Chon Aike Formation. Occurrences of lead and
zinc mineralization have also been discovered. Locally, the rocks of the Deseado Massif are covered by Tertiary-aged basalt and younger unconsolidated sediments, that post-date silver and gold mineralization.
Exploration in 2012 consisted of geologic mapping, sampling, geophysical and geochemical surveys amounting to $5.8 million and the completion of 54,809 feet (16,706 meters) of core drilling. The 2013 exploration budget for Joaquin is $3.3 million.
Year-end Mineralized Material - Joaquin Development Property

Mineralized material is effective as of December 31, 2012. Metal prices used to calculate mineralized material were $1,700 per ounce of gold and $33.00 per ounce of silver. Tons are shown, in 2012, reflecting the Company's current 100% interest in the Joaquin property.
(2)
Mineralized material was estimated with surface mine parameters and initial metallurgical test results.
(3)
Mineralized material estimates were prepared by a consulting engineering group from Santiago, Chile and supervised by A. Cruzat and C. Romo of the Company's exploration staff.
(4)
Mineralized material was estimated using 3-dimensional geologic modeling and geostatistical evaluation of the exploration drill data. Blocks must be influenced by at least two different drill holes within a distance corresponding to 100% of the variogram range of each deposit.
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY
Exploration and reserve development expenditures of $40.2 million, $26.3 million and $18.0 million were incurred by the Company in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
During 2012, the company drilled a total of 625,152 feet (190,546 meters) in its global exploration program. A total of 620,795 feet (189,218 meters) were drilled to explore for and define new silver and gold mineralization in existing operating areas and development properties. The remainder was drilled on the company's early stage properties in Chile. In addition, at the Kensington Mine in Alaska, 77,730 feet (23,692 meters) of tightly-spaced definition drilling was completed at Block K.
The main components of the 2012 program included:
•
Drilling to expand known mineralized zones in and around the current Palmarejo surface and underground mine. The program was focused on the Tucson-Chapotillo zones with surface drilling and on the Rosario, 76 and 108 zones with underground drilling.
•
Surface drilling to extend and define the Guadalupe and La Patria deposits in the Palmarejo district and initial testing of several new targets in the district.
•
Surface drilling to expand the La Negra and La Morocha deposits within the Joaquin property located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Exploration drilling at the Martha mine and the Lejano project area in Argentina was also conducted this year.
•
Underground drilling to expand and define gold mineralization in the Raven vein at Kensington and test new targets peripheral to Kensington.
•
Surface drilling to test extensions of the main north-northeast mineralized trends within the greater Rochester property and a large drilling program to evaluate the tons and grade of historic surface dumps and leach pads.
•
New surface trenching and sampling at San Bartolomé in Bolivia.
Mexico
Exploration in Mexico was focused primarily in the Palmarejo district in the state of Chihuahua. A total of $19.9 million was spent in 2012 on mapping, sampling, drill target generation and drilling to identify and define new silver and gold mineralization. A total of 341,975 feet (104,234 meters) was completed, including 149,635 feet (45,609 meters) of surface and underground drilling completed around the current Palmarejo mine. The remainder was devoted to the Guadalupe and La Patria deposit areas and other new targets in the district. The budget for 2013 for exploration in Mexico is $15.8 million of which over 95% is to be allocated to the Palmarejo district.
USA - Kensington
Exploration in 2012 consisted of drilling 143,796 feet (43,829 meters) of core at Kensington. The majority of this work was devoted to in-fill drilling of Block K and the Raven vein. New drilling focused on Kensington South, the Ann Trend, Elmira
vein and on surface drilling of the Jualin Mine. The Company plans for an additional underground drilling program in 2013 on Zone 10, Zone 50, Zone 30, Kensington South, Elmira vein, and Ann. Continued surface drilling is planned at the Jualin Mine and several other targets on the property. The total 2013 Kensington exploration budget is $8.6 million.
USA - Rochester
The Company conducted drilling programs on the Rochester North and West historic stockpiles and Northwest Rochester, Nevada Packard and South Mystic areas in 2012. These programs amounted to 138,121 feet (42,099 meters) of vertical and angled reverse circulation, Sonic® (rotary vibratory drilling) and core holes. The Company has allocated $3.5 million for exploration in 2013 at the greater Rochester property.
Argentina - Martha Mine
In 2012, the Company's exploration efforts at the Martha Mine consisted of 10,646 feet (3,245 meters) of core drilling in several locations around the mine and at the Company's Malbec target north of the mine. In September of 2012, the Company ceased active mining operations at Martha.
Argentina - Other Properties
Activities focused on the Joaquin property where a total of 54,809 feet of drilling (16,706 meters) was completed. Drilling at Joaquin during 2012 continued to return encouraging results on two targets: La Negra and La Morocha. Additional exploratory and definition drilling will continue in 2013 on this property. In 2010, the Company met its obligations, under its agreement with Mirasol Resources Ltd., to earn an initial 51% participating and managing equity interest in the Joaquin property. In 2012, the Company acquired Mirasol's 49% interest in Joaquin to establish 100% ownership. The purchase has been treated as an acquisition of mineral rights.
Lejano Project - Argentina
The Lejano silver and gold exploration-stage project is located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina approximately 110 miles (180 kilometers) northwest of the Company's Martha mine and approximately 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of the town of Perito Moreno. The property is accessed by paved and all weather gravel roads, leading from the towns of Gobernador Gregores or from Perito Moreno.
The Lejano property encompasses over 82,000 acres (33,282 hectares) of exploration concessions within three groups of concessions and several exploration targets, including Cisne, Cerro Armando and Ciclon. In 2002 the Company acquired its initial interest in the Lejano area from Yamana S.R.L. as part of its purchase of the Martha mine and other properties in the province. The Company also controls other concessions in the Lejano area that are not subject to a royalty.
Lejano is located in the northwestern portion of the Deseado Massif in southern Argentina. Host rocks to mineralization at Lejano are a sequence of Jurassic-aged volcanic rocks, predominantly tuffs and flows, assigned to the Chon Aike Formation. The Chon Aike is major host to precious metal mineralization in the Deseado Massif. Silver and lesser gold and base metal mineralization at Lejano are hosted in three, known west-northwest oriented, moderately- to steeply-dipping structural zones. The mineralized material reported herein was estimate from drilling in the South Ridge structural zone. Mineralization at Lejano occurs in silicified fractures, veins and fault zones. In general, the known mineralization at Lejano is well-oxidized to approximately 330 feet (100 meters) depth grading locally into sulfide.
Exploration in 2012 consisted of geologic mapping, sampling, geophysical and geochemical surveys, and drilling amounting to $1.4 million and the completion of 4,888 feet (1,490 meters) of core drilling. Favorable results from this program allowed for the estimation of the first mineralized material tons and average grades for South Ridge zone, one of three known mineralized zones on the Lejano project. The 2013 exploration budget for the Lejano area is $1.8 million.
Year-end Mineralized Material - Lejano Exploration-Stage Property
