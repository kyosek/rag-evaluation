ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7
for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 53 Malls and non-controlling interests in 10 Malls as of December 31, 2019. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more anchors or junior anchors and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor and junior anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo was classified as a Non-stabilized Mall as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
(3)
Excluded Malls - We exclude Malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded:
a.
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the Property or convey the secured Property to the lender. Hickory Point Mall and Greenbrier Mall were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2019. Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center and Triangle Town Center were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, Acadiana Mall was returned to the lender and Cary Towne Center was sold. In July 2019, Triangle Town Center was returned to the lender. Lender Malls are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers.
b.
Repositioning Malls - Malls that are currently being repositioned or where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property. This may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, we may determine that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. The steps taken to reposition these Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Repositioning Malls. Hickory Point Mall was classified as a Repositioning Mall as of December 31, 2018 until its reclassification as a Lender Mall in 2019.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Brookfield Square, Cross Creek Mall, Dakota Square Mall, EastGate Mall, Meridian Mall, St. Clair Square, Stroud Mall and WestGate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.
The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands except for sales per square foot amounts):

Although Mall stores occupy only 34.4% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 65.6% is occupied by Anchors and Junior Anchors and a small percentage is vacant), the Malls received 82.8% of their total revenues from Mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Anchors and Junior Anchors
Anchors and Junior Anchors are an important factor in a Property’s successful performance. However, we believe that the number of traditional department store anchors will decline over time, providing us the opportunity to redevelop these spaces to attract new uses such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness centers, casinos, grocery stores and lifestyle retailers that engage consumers and encourage them to spend more time at our Properties. Anchors are generally a department store or, increasingly, other large format retailers, whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the Property's tenants.
Anchors and Junior Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to non-anchor tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors and Junior Anchors accounted for 1 7. % of the total revenues from our Properties in 201 . Each Anchor and Junior Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2019, the following Anchors and Junior Anchors were added to our Properties, as listed below:
As of December 31, 201 , the Properties had a total of Anchors and Junior Anchors, including vacant Anchor and Junior Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors and Junior Anchors at our Excluded Malls.
