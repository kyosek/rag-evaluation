Reserves
The Company's net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (referred to herein collectively as "oil") and its net proved reserves of gas have been estimated by the Company's engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reserve estimates at December 31, 1994, have been audited by independent petroleum consultants, H. J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. The estimates for the prior years were audited by L. A. Martin & Associates, Inc. These estimates were used in the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization included in the Company's consolidated financial statements and for other reporting purposes. The Company has not filed any estimates of reserves with any
federal authority or agency during the past year other than estimates contained in its last annual report on Form 10-K. Set forth below are estimates of the Company's net proved oil and gas reserves, all located in the United States.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. The accompanying table presents a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the production of the Company's estimated proved oil and gas reserves at the end of 1994 and 1993. The method of calculating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is as follows:
(1) Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas to the Company's year-end quantities of proved oil and gas reserves. Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.
(2) Future development and production costs are estimates of expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at year- end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
(3) Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to future pretax net cash flows. Future income tax expenses reflect the permanent differences, tax credits and allowances related to the Company's oil and gas producing activities included in the Company's consolidated income tax expense.
(4) The discount, calculated at ten percent per year, reflects an estimate of the timing of future net cash flows to give effect to the time value of money.

Description of Significant Properties
The three producing properties of major significance to the Company are Main Pass Block 64, located in federal waters offshore Louisiana, the North Frisco City Field in Alabama and the LaBarge Project located in southwestern Wyoming. These properties represent, in total, 4,810 MBbl and 55,699 MMcf of the Company's estimated proved reserves of oil and natural gas, respectively, at December 31, 1994. In addition, the Company owns fee mineral interests in 876,000 net acres in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. The following sets forth certain information with respect to the Company's interest in its most significant properties.
Main Pass Block 64. Main Pass Block 64 (Main Pass) is located in federal waters offshore Louisiana about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans. The Company, as operator, discovered oil and gas upon drilling a test well in 1982. By August 1983, the Company had completed nine producing wells, one gas injection well, and designed, constructed and placed on-line a production platform and oil
pipeline facilities. Since then, the Company has completed eight more wells, tied into an interstate natural gas pipeline system, converted the gas injection well to a producing well and increased its working interest from 52% to almost 80%. In 1989, the Company acquired an 80% working interest in an adjacent block with five wells, a production platform and oil and gas pipelines. The Company subsequently unitized portions of these two blocks covering the then known limits of the main pay sand (the 7,300' Sand Unit), and then designed, constructed and placed on-line a waterflood project intended to repressure the 7,300' Sand Unit. Gross cumulative production from the field over almost twelve years has totaled 9,021 MBbl of oil and 24,892 MMcf of natural gas. During the fourth quarter of 1994, net production averaged 1,220 BOPD and 173 McfPD of natural gas.
Under a farm-out arrangement from the Company, a third party drilled, completed and tested a deep test well in 1993. During 1994, the Company and its partners in the 7300' Sand Unit acquired the deep well from the third party. The consideration for this acquisition was the Company's acceptance of liability to plug the deep well when it is abandoned. In December 1994, the Company connected this well to the existing platform and production began in January 1995.
The Company currently has a working interest which averages approximately 80% in 24 gross (19.1 net) wells, five of which are water injection wells. All of the water injection wells are located on the adjacent block, utilizing the production platform as a water injection facility.
Proved reserves attributable to Main Pass at December 31, 1994 were 3,622 MBbl of oil and 7,346 MMcf of natural gas, representing 50% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's proved oil and natural gas reserves.
North Frisco City Field. The North Frisco City Field (North Frisco City), located in Monroe County, Alabama, was discovered in March 1991. After the discovery well was completed, the structural complexity of this find led the Company and its partners to run a 3-D seismic program over the potential field area. Based on this data, five successful development wells were completed during 1992, two in 1993 and three in 1994. Only one dry hole has been drilled to date, thereby establishing an eastern limit to the field. In the fourth quarter of 1994, the field was unitized. The Company currently has a 24.1% working interest in nine gross (2.2 net) producing wells in the Unit, each of which is producing from the Frisco City sand member of the Haynesville formation at a depth of about 12,000 feet. In addition, the Company has interests in two wells not included in the Unit. Aggregate net production from this field averaged 1,128 BPD of crude oil, 208 BPD of natural gas liquids and 1,066 McfPD of natural gas during the fourth quarter of 1994.
The Company's estimated proved reserves from its working interest in North Frisco City at December 31, 1994 were 1,188 MBbl of oil and 2,608 MMcf of natural gas, representing approximately 16% and 4%, respectively, of the Company's total proved oil and natural gas reserves. The Company also owns a royalty interest in this field through its ownership of the fee mineral properties discussed below. Analysis of reservoir and production data from this field indicates that a pressure maintenance program could substantially increase the amount of proved reserves. The Company plans to initiate this type of program in 1995.
Fee Mineral Properties. In August 1993, the Company acquired all of the fee mineral properties of the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Jackson, Mississippi (FICBJ). The Company paid FICBJ $24.1 million for these properties and expended an additional $0.2 million for costs related to the acquisition.
The properties consist of 876,000 net acres of fee mineral interests located in Mississippi (64%), Alabama (35%) and Louisiana (1%). The purchase price was allocated $6.1 million to producing acreage and $18.2 million to non- producing acreage. The value assigned to the producing acreage is included in the full cost pool being amortized as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 1994 the producing acreage produced 72,801 barrels of oil and 443,378 Mcf of natural gas at average sales prices of $14.41 per Bbl and $1.79 per Mcf, respectively. Proved reserves attributable to the producing acreage at December 31, 1994, were 461 MBbl of oil and 3,248 MMcf of natural gas.
The non-producing fee mineral properties generate lease bonus and delay rental revenues. During 1994 and the period in 1993 while the Company owned the properties, revenues of $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were generated from these types of activities.
In February 1994, the Company entered into a joint venture with several industry companies to pursue exploration and development opportunities derived from the Company's fee mineral interests. Howell continues to receive all of the revenues from lease bonuses, delay rentals and its royalty interests in the fee mineral properties. The purpose of the joint venture is to actively participate, as working interest owners, in drilling prospects brought to the Company by explorationists who actively generate in the Mississippi and Alabama areas where the Company's fee mineral acreage is located.
LaBarge Project. The LaBarge Project, located in southwestern Wyoming, consists of three federal units, seventeen producing wells, a field gathering system, a dehydration plant, a 32-mile dehydrated raw gas pipeline, a gas processing plant with a capacity for processing up to 600,000 McfPD of raw gas into natural gas, carbon dioxide, helium and sulfur, and marketing facilities for the sale of the plant products. The Company has a 4.8% working interest in one of the units, the Fogarty Creek Unit. The Company has an interest in 12 gross (0.6 net) wells producing from depths between 14,500 feet to 17,000 feet in the Fogarty Creek Unit. Exxon Company USA (Exxon) holds a 92% interest in the Fogarty Creek Unit and a 100% interest in each of the other two units, the plants and the marketing facilities.
The Company's raw gas is processed pursuant to an agreement with Exxon which provided for an initial processing fee equal to 65% of the sales value of the plant product through August 1991, increasing to 75% from that date forward until the sooner of payout of the gas processing plant or September 2021, at which time it will adjust to a cost-plus fee, not to exceed 50% of the sales value of the products. The processing agreement also provides for Exxon to market all of the Company's products from the LaBarge Project.
The Company has significant production and reserves of carbon dioxide and helium and small amounts of production and reserves of sulfur from its interest in the LaBarge Project, which are not included in its production and proved reserves of oil and natural gas discussed elsewhere in Item 2. The table below presents information on the Company's net production of natural gas, carbon dioxide and helium attributable to the Company's interest in the LaBarge Project. The natural gas data from the LaBarge Project is also included in the other tables set forth elsewhere in Item 2.
Until October 1994, the Company, Exxon and Bechtel Enterprises, Inc. (Bechtel) had an exclusive site development agreement for an electric cogeneration facility at the LaBarge gas processing plant. The parties allowed the agreement to expire as efforts to locate electric supply contracts continue.
Based on the business concepts and strategies the Company established during the early stages of developing the proposed LaBarge cogeneration plant, the Company began to investigate other geographic areas in which some of the same concepts and strategies may apply. As a result of this investigation, the Company and Bechtel entered into an exclusive site development agreement with Conoco Inc. to develop a similar project in New Mexico. Additional agreements with Sonat Inc. for a facility in Mississippi and Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. for a facility in Canada were also negotiated. The Conoco and Sonat agreements expire in the third quarter of 1995 and the Amoco agreement expires in 1996.
If the companies successfully obtain contracts to supply electricity to be generated from the proposed cogeneration plants, then definitive agreements covering ownership, gas supply, site lease, financing and other matters must be negotiated. The proposed cogeneration plants are subject to a number of contingencies, some of which have been outlined above. There can be no assurance that all of these contingencies will be met or that any of these projects will proceed.
B. Other Properties
In addition to the oil and gas properties described above, the Company and its subsidiaries lease approximately 47,500 sq. ft. for use as corporate and administrative offices in Houston, Texas. The Company's technical fuels and chemical processing operations are conducted at a 50 acre facility owned by the Company. The facility, located in Channelview, Texas, includes buildings covering 24,500 sq. ft.
