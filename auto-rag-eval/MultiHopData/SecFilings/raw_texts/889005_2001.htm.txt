ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Properties - Principal Areas of Operations
Our operations are concentrated in the following divisions: Northern, which includes properties in the Rocky Mountains, principally in North Dakota and Wyoming; Southern, which includes properties principally in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana; and Gulf of Mexico, which includes our offshore properties. We operate approximately 70% of the net present value of our reserves. We finance our exploitation, exploration and acquisition activities through cash flows from operations and through borrowings under our credit agreement and other financing activities. Set forth below is summary information concerning average daily production during the fourth quarter of 2001 and estimated reserves and a pre-tax SEC net present value of estimated proved reserves discounted at 10%, as of December 31, 2001 in our divisions.
Northern Division
The Northern Division conducts operations in the Rocky Mountain region which includes the Williston, Powder River, Big Horn and Green River Basins. The Division represented 25% of our net present value of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001 and contributed 28% of our fourth quarter 2001 production. We have interests in 731,788 developed and 1,419,208 undeveloped gross acres in the region and in 1,862 gross (approximately 522 net) producing wells.
Our strategy in the Northern Division is to develop lower-risk opportunities, exploit infill, horizontal and secondary/tertiary recovery opportunities on existing properties and make tactical acquisitions to enhance current operations.
On March 1, 2002 we completed the purchase of producing oil and gas properties located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana for approximately $38.7 million. We estimate the total proved reserves for these properties as of December 31, 2001 to be approximately 53.1 Bcfe, of
which approximately 90% is oil. The reserves are not included in the table above and these estimates have not been audited by our independent petroleum engineering firm. We will operate over 70% of these properties, which have an average lifting cost of $0.51 per Mcfe. We estimate that net production from these properties will average approximately 13.9 Mmcfe/d in 2002.
North Dakota. Our two most active projects in North Dakota are in the South Fryburg Tyler area and the Wiley field.
•South Fryburg Tyler Area. The South Fryburg Tyler area continues to be one of our most active drilling programs. We continue development within the South Fryburg Tyler Unit, where we are the operator. We are also involved in exploration and development drilling in the Mission Canyon formation on a contiguous acreage block southeast of the Unit. Within the South Fryburg Tyler Unit, we expanded the Tyler sand production with development drilling in 2001. On our acreage block adjoining the Unit to the southeast, where we own over 76,000 gross acres, our drilling program targets zones within the Mission Canyon formation. We have participated in 26 horizontal wells on this acreage, 19 of which were drilled in 2001. The 26 wells had initial production rates of approximately 190 bbl/d. In 2002, we expect to participate in an additional 4 to 8 wells on this block.
•Wiley Field. We operate this waterflood with a 54% working interest. In 2000, we initiated a horizontal drilling program with five wells and in 2001 drilled 17 wells, all of which were successful. In addition to the horizontal drilling, we increased water injection capacity to expand our waterflood program. As a result of this activity, gross daily production has increased from approximately 600 bbl/d in April 2000 to over 2,400 bbl/d at the end of 2001. Over the next 12 months, we plan to drill 10 to 15 additional wells in this area while continuing to increase water injection capacity.
Wyoming. Our three primary areas of focus in Wyoming are the Big Horn Basin, the Powder River Basin and the Greater Green River area. The Merger added in excess of 1.1 million gross acres of exploratory acreage in the Big Horn, Wind River and Greater Green River gas basins of Wyoming. We plan to drill 15 to 20 exploration wells in these areas over the next 12 to 24 months. The wells will target multiple formations and successful projects hold the potential for multi-well development programs.
•Big Horn Basin. The Gooseberry field is our most significant property in the basin. We own a 100% working interest (nearly 90% net revenue interest) in this field, which consists of two waterflood units. Since acquiring the field in February 1995, we have more than doubled the production from approximately 535 bbl/d to over 1,100 bbl/d in December 2001. This has been accomplished through the acquisition of proprietary 3-D seismic data, drilling of delineation wells, installation of the two waterfloods and the addition of shallower producing zones. During the next 12 months, we plan to drill from two to three additional wells and to expand water injection capacity. In January 2002 we placed a larger pipeline in service to accommodate the increasing production from the unit.
•Powder River Basin. We currently own more than 27,000 net undeveloped acres in the Powder River Basin, which we believe are prospective for coalbed methane drilling. In 2000 and 2001, we participated in the drilling of 178 wells, all of which were successful. We operate 84 of these wells. In 2002, we expect to participate in another 130 to 160 wells.
•Greater Green River Area. One of the primary operating locations within the Greater Green River area is the Moxa Arch Trend, where we drilled 16 wells in 2001, 14 of which were successful. This area represents a multi-year program where we have identified more than 100 potential drilling locations on our acreage. Wells target the Frontier and Dakota formations at depths that range from approximately 10,000 to 12,500 feet. Production from Moxa Arch wells,
particularly from the Frontier formation, tends to be long-lived, with 25 to 30 year reserve life potential.
Southern Division
The Southern Division conducts operations in the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent and onshore Gulf Coast regions. This division represented 43% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001 and contributed 41% of our fourth quarter 2001 production. We have interests in 578,252 developed and 165,939 undeveloped gross acres and in 3,900 gross (approximately 1,603 net) producing wells.
Permian Basin. The Southern Division's principal Permian Basin properties are the Andrews Unit, Howard Glasscock Field and the Shafter Lake San Andres Unit.
•Andrews Unit. The Andrews Unit, acquired as part of the Merger, produces from the Wolfcamp/Penn formation at approximately 8,600 feet. We have a 98.6% working interest in this 3,230-acre Unit. Water injection began in late 1996 with the first response occurring in late 1998. During 2000 and 2001, we expanded the waterflood program by drilling additional wells, converting wells to injection, and performing workovers on existing wells. As a result, Unit production continues to increase from an 855 bbl/d average in 2000 to 911 bbl/d average in 2001. We plan to drill two wells and convert two wells to injectors in 2002. We believe that production from this waterflood Unit can be further enhanced with the use of CO2 flooding or other tertiary recovery methods.
•Howard Glasscock Field. We continue to exploit our 100% working interest in the Howard Glasscock Field. Based on the results from adjacent successful waterfloods, we believe that additional potential exists through the installation of new and expansion of existing waterfloods on our leases. In May 2001, we initiated a drilling program for 27 injection and development wells to expand waterfloods on two of our leases. Water injection commenced in first quarter 2002. Additionally, we have identified a number of opportunities for recompletion and well deepenings.
•Shafter Lake San Andres Unit. The Shafter Lake San Andres Unit, also acquired as part of the Merger, is a 12,880-acre Unit that produces from the Grayburg and San Andres formations at a depth of approximately 4,500 feet. We have an 81.4% working interest in this secondary recovery Unit. In 2002, we plan to drill eight wells on 10-acre spacing. Operators of nearby San Andres fields have successfully drilled to 10-acre spacing before CO2 injection. We believe the potential exists for CO2 flooding as the field matures.
Mid-Continent. The Southern Division's Mid-Continent operations are currently focused in Oklahoma and Kansas. Oil production is concentrated in our operated waterfloods in Oklahoma, while natural gas production is primarily in third party operated wells in Oklahoma and in our operated wells in Kansas. The most significant waterflood unit in Oklahoma is the Calumet Cottage Grove Unit, which we acquired as part of the Merger. We operate this secondary recovery Unit consisting of 11,400 acres in central Oklahoma. Production is from the Pennsylvanian Cottage Grove formation at 8,100 feet. We have a 44.1% working interest in this Unit. In 2001, a total of seven wells were drilled, all of which were successful and six of which were drilled prior to the Merger. We plan to drill four to six additional wells in 2002.
Onshore Gulf Coast. The Southern Division's Gulf Coast operations are primarily focused in the Austin Chalk/Georgetown trend of east-central Texas and in Northern Louisiana where we are active in two fields, the Elm Grove Field and the North Louisiana Field Complex.
•Austin Chalk/Georgetown Trend. The trend is a fractured carbonate formation that has been highly conducive to the application of horizontal drilling technology. The Austin Chalk formation
is encountered in this field at depths ranging between approximately 7,000 and 17,000 feet. The Georgetown formation, approximately 300 to 500 feet below the base of the Austin Chalk, has been a secondary objective in the field. We control approximately 50,000 gross (13,000 net) undeveloped acres and 114,000 gross (43,000 net) developed acres in this area. In 2001, we participated in the drilling of five Georgetown wells prior to the Merger and one Austin Chalk well after the Merger. All were successful. In 2002 we plan to re-enter six wells to drill Georgetown horizontal sections.
•Elm Grove Field. This field was drilled to extend the Cotton Valley production downdip from the mature Caspiana field. In addition to the Cotton Valley, shallower secondary objectives include the Hosston and Rodessa intervals. Through the Merger we acquired an approximately 37% non-operating working interest in the field. In 2001 a total of 42 wells were drilled, 17 of which were drilled after the Merger. All of the wells were successful. Gross production in the field has increased from 34 Mmcfe/d in January 2001 to 54 Mmcfe/d in December 2001. In 2002, we plan to drill 25 to 30 wells.
•North Louisiana Field Complex. We acquired this interest in late 1998 and have identified over 100 development locations in its four fields-Ada, Sibley, West Bryceland and Sailes. The 2,000 foot thick Hosston interval contains over 20 separate producing zones. In 2001, we drilled 34 wells, all of which were successful. We anticipate drilling between 35 and 45 wells in this region in each of the next two years.
Gulf of Mexico Division
The Gulf of Mexico Division represented 32% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001 and contributed 31% of our fourth quarter 2001 production. We have interests in 303,804 developed and 357,059 undeveloped gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico and in 158 gross (approximately 47 net) producing wells.
In addition to a production base with numerous exploitation opportunities within our developed acreage, the Gulf of Mexico provides us with moderate-risk exploration targets. We drilled 16 exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2001, 11 of which were successful. We have under license 3-D seismic data covering over 18,000 square miles (approximately 2,300 blocks) and 2-D seismic data covering 150,000 linear miles within the Gulf of Mexico.
West Cameron Blocks 180/198. The West Cameron Blocks 180/198 complex consists of all or a portion of seven offshore blocks, including 30,000 gross developed and 5,000 gross undeveloped acres. This field was never owned by an independent producer prior to its purchase by Old Westport in October 1997. The complex is located 30 miles offshore in 52 feet of water. It has produced approximately 1.7 Tcf of natural gas and 10 Mmbbl of oil from over 20 separate producing zones since its discovery. Since acquiring this field, we have increased gross production from approximately 26 Mmcfe/d to 63 Mmcfe/d at year-end 2001. At the time of the acquisition, estimated proved reserves net to our interest were 77 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2001, we had 84 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves in the complex.
In the first quarter of 2001, we commenced production on three development wells drilled in 2000, and in the third quarter of 2001 we commenced production on three development wells drilled in the first half of 2001. We also drilled a successful exploration well in the complex in 2001. The complex holds additional drilling opportunities.
West Cameron Blocks 613/614. In 1999, we discovered this field, located approximately 120 miles offshore in 290 feet of water. We drilled a second exploration well on an adjoining block in the third quarter of 2000. We operate the field with a working interest of 50% and installed facilities and commenced production in December 2000. At year-end, the wells were producing at 22 Mmcfe/d (9 Mmcfe/d net).
West Cameron Block 370. We discovered this field, located approximately 60 miles offshore in 78 feet of water, in the fourth quarter of 2000. We operate the field with a 60% working interest. Following the discovery well we drilled three additional wells, installed a platform and commenced production in the third quarter of 2001. At year-end, the wells were producing at 30 Mmcfe/d (15 Mmcfe/d net).
East Cameron Block 369. We discovered this field in the first quarter of 2001 and commenced production from it in December 2001. It is located approximately 132 miles offshore in 350 feet of water. We operate the two-well field with a 60% working interest. At year-end, the wells were producing at 20 Mmcfe/d (10 Mmcfe/d net).
Vermilion Block 408. This field is located approximately 110 miles offshore in 400 feet of water and was discovered in 1999. We have a 25% non-operated working interest in the field. A second well was drilled in this block in the third quarter of 2000. A third well was in progress at year end 2001. Facilities were installed in late 2001 and production commenced in the first quarter of 2002.
Mississippi Canyon Block 322. This field is located approximately 35 miles offshore in 750 feet of water and was discovered in the second quarter of 2001. We own a non-operated 25% working interest in the field. A second well was also drilled. Both wells have been completed and production commenced in the first quarter of 2002.
Recent Discoveries. In 2002, we will continue to exploit the following discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico:
•High Island Block 197. This field is located approximately 28 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001. We have a 25% non-operated working interest in the field. A second well was in progress at year end 2001. In the first quarter of 2002, we farmed into an adjoining block and an exploratory well is currently drilling. We expect a platform to be installed and production to be commenced in the second half of 2002.
•High Island Block 84. This field is located approximately 23 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001. We operate the field with a 52% working interest. We plan to install a platform and commence production in the third quarter of 2002.
•South Timbalier 316. We discovered this field located approximately 66 miles offshore in 300 feet of water, in the fourth quarter of 2001. We operate the field with a 40% working interest. Three wells have been drilled. We expect to install a platform and commence production in the second half of 2003.
Other Exploration Activity. During 2002, we anticipate drilling eight to eleven exploration prospects.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated:
(1)The difference in net present value from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 502.7 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the Merger, (ii) the addition of 92 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions, (iii) the downward revision of 33 Bcfe due to revisions of previous estimates and (iv) the decrease in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $26.83 to $19.78 per bbl of oil and from $9.52 to $2.72 per Mmbtu of natural gas).
(2)The difference in net present value from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 134 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the merger between Westport Oil and Gas and EPGC, (ii) the addition of 52 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions and (iii) the increase in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $25.60 to $26.83 per bbl of oil and from $2.30 to $9.52 per Mmbtu of natural gas).
(3)The standardized measure is the value of the future after-tax net revenues discounted at 10%. The difference between the net present value and the standardized measure is the effect of income taxes discounted at 10%. Estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof as of December 31, 2001 are based upon a reserve report prepared by the Company's engineering staff, 87% of the net present value of which was audited by the independent petroleum engineering firm of Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof as of December 31, 2000 are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of Ryder Scott Company, L.P., Netherland Sewell and Associates, Inc. and internal estimates. The Ryder Scott and Netherland Sewell reports covered approximately 85% of the net present value of the reserves and the net present value thereof.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of exploitation expenditures. The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly, and estimates of other engineers might differ materially from those shown above. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The present value shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is mandated by generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties that we operate, expenses exclude our share of overhead charges. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things, general and administrative costs and interest expense.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated:
(1)Production of natural gas liquids was not meaningful for 1999.
(2)Does not include the effects of hedging transactions.
Producing Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2001 relating to the producing wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. We also held royalty interests in 1,726 producing wells as of that date. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
Acreage
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2001 relating to acreage held by us. Developed acreage is assigned to producing wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage held under lease, permit, contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for exploitation or exploratory drilling. The term "gross acres" refers to the total number of acres in which we own a working interest. The term "net acres" refers to gross acres multiplied by our fractional working interest therein.
Drilling Results
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells drilled during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of
reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return.
As of December 31, 2001, four additional exploration and seven development wells were in progress.
ITEM 3.
