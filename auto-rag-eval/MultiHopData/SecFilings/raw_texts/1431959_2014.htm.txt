Investment in oil and gas properties for 2014 is detailed as follows:
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Reserve Estimates
SEC Case. The following tables sets forth, as of December 31, 2014, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, the estimated present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10%) of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes (PV-10) and after future income taxes (Standardized Measure) of our proved reserves and our estimated net probable oil and natural gas reserves, each prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with assumptions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of our reserves are located in the United States.
The PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies. We believe investors and creditors use PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and neither it nor the Standardized Measure is intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
Our PV-10 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 is materially reconciled to our Standardized Measure of discounted cash flows at those dates by reducing the PV-10 by the discounted future income taxes associated with such reserves. The discounted future income taxes at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were $678,904 and $7,093,985.
The estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions at December 31, 2014. For purposes of determining prices, we used the average of prices received for each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2014, adjusted for quality and location differences, which was $91.48 per barrel of oil and $4.35 per MCF of gas. This average historical price is not a prediction of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization.

BOE equivalents are determined by combining barrels of oil with MCF of gas divided by six.
The decrease of 89,393 BOE (89,285 for our Hunton Project and 108 for our Marcelina Project) in proved undeveloped reserves comes from the third party engineering studies of the Cimarron and Chisholm Trail AMI's in Oklahoma which were acquired by the Company in 2013 and engineering studies for our Marcelina Project.
No reserve value for the Ring Project is included in 2014 reserve tables presented above since the company believes this project is still considered to be in the testing phase.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
The preceding table shows significant decrease in the Acquisition category for 2014 as compared to 2013. The 2013 Acquisition increase is all related to the working interest acquired in the Cimarron and the Chisholm Trail AMI's with Husky Ventures in Oklahoma during 2013. During 2014 the company focused on expanding its participation in the Chisholm Trail and Cimarron AMI’S in Oklahoma which accounts for the increase in Extensions and Discoveries for 2014.
The 2013 Revisions of Previous Estimates are composed of revisions to the proved producing and proved undeveloped reserves.
The downward revision of 388,485 BO results primarily from eliminating two Eagle Ford wells (which are now considered uneconomic at current prices) from reserve report calculations for the Company’s properties in the Marcelina Creek Project in Texas. This reflects a reduction of 366,366 BO offset directly by an increase in reserves of 60,159 BO from the currently producing wells. The Johnson #1 is the largest contributor, with an increase of reserves of 56,783 BO. The Johnson #2 and #4 account for an additional increase of 3,376 BO. The remaining difference comes from reserve adjustments in the well data for the Oklahoma Properties reserve calculations for 2014.
The positive revision of 821,150 MCF of gas is attributable to gas production increase from the development activity in the Chisholm Trail and Cimarron AMI’s in Oklahoma where the Company focused on expanding its participation in 2014 drilling and development. Gas reserves can be fully attributable to our Oklahoma joint venture operations. Most of our wells in the program are horizontally drilled wells that produce from the Hunton rock which requires a fracking stimulation to achieve the maximum production rates. Typically these wells have a relatively high initial production rates, but decline rapidly. Three wells in our Oklahoma ventures contribute 244.8 MMcf of the total improvement. As a result of the PDP wells success the offsetting PUD wells are expected to be significant contributors as well. Our other producing wells in Oklahoma are evenly spread.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, both proved and probable reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows, and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
In estimating probable reserves, it should be noted that those reserve estimates inherently involve greater risk and uncertainty than estimates of proved reserves. While analysis of geoscience and engineering data provides reasonable certainty that proved reserves can be economically producible from known formations under existing conditions and within a reasonable time, probable reserves involve less certainty than reserves with a higher classification due to less data to support their ultimate recovery. Probable reserves have not been discounted for the additional risk associated with future recovery. Prospective investors should be aware that as the categories of reserves decrease with certainty, the risk of recovering reserves at the PV-10 calculation increases. The reserves and net present worth discounted at 10% relating to the different categories of proved and probable have not been adjusted for risk due to their uncertainty of recovery and thus are not comparable and should not be summed into total amounts.

Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies
The reserve estimates, including PV-10 estimates, set forth above were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. with respect to the Company’s Marcelina Creek Project in Texas, and PeTech Enterprises, Inc. for the Company’s properties in Oklahoma. A copy of their full reports with regard to our reserves is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K. These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.
Our Chairman of our Board of Directors is an experienced and qualified geoscience professional with a degree in geophysical science, but we do not have any employees with specific reservoir engineering qualifications in the company. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer worked closely with Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and PeTech Enterprises Inc. in connection with their preparation of our reserve estimates, including assessing the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the methods and assumptions used in this process.
The reserves estimates for the Marcelina Creek Project included herein have been independently evaluated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
As of December 31, 2014, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 1,311,733 barrels of oil equivalents compared to 1,401,126 as of December 31, 2013, a decrease of 89,393. These proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 were associated with our Marcelina Creek Field property (which decreased by 108) and our Hunton projects (which account for the decrease of 89,285). These numbers are taken from the third party reserves studies by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and PeTech.
This decrease of 89,825 BOE in proved undeveloped reserves attributable to our Hunton projects comes from the third party engineering study from PeTech of the Cimarron and Chisholm Trail AMI's in Oklahoma. The net reserves change associated with these properties is a decrease of approximately 28 Mbbl of oil and an increase of approximately 278 MMcf of gas, or 46 MBOE calculated with a gas-oil equivalency factor of six. We acquired an interest in the Boeckman 1-14H well in May 2013, representing our first property in Oklahoma. Over the course of 2013, we acquired interests in five wells that were producing by December 31, 2013 and acquired interests in six other wells that were drilled and completed, but not producing, by December 31, 2013. During 2014 we acquired interest in eleven wells that were producing at December 31, 2014.
With respect to our Marcelina Project, the decrease in proved undeveloped reserves of 108 BO in Texas is due to a combination of factors. This reduction was based on analysis by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. of performance for offset Eagle Ford producers adjacent to the Company's lease.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
We made various investments and progress during 2014 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. The capital expenditures incurred in converting our proved undeveloped reserves to developed were approximately $16,240,288. We believe that nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 will be developed within five years. Limitations on our ability to develop proved undeveloped reserves within five years would likely be due to restraints on our capital and/or personnel moving forward. The restraints, however, could be alleviated through increased revenue or additional funding.
Our current drilling plans, subject to sufficient capital resources and the periodic evaluation of interim drilling results and other potential investment opportunities, include drilling substantially all of the Buda wells in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2015 and 2016. We do not currently have plans to drill the Eagle Ford shale wells in the next year. The area of the Marcelina Creek Field is an active area of Eagle Ford shale development, and we intend to actively explore our options with regard to these proved undeveloped locations and other potential Eagle Ford drilling locations on our acreage. Further we will maintain our continuous drilling program in the Hunton projects for the foreseeable future.
Production, Price, and Production Cost History
During the year ended December 31, 2014, we produced and sold 56,915 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $90.58 per bbl. We produced and sold 170,094 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $5.89 per MCF. Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $14.63 per BOE. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $30.43 per BOE.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we produced and sold 13,286 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $100.67 per bbl. We produced and sold 3.540 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $5.68 per MCF.Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $31.29 per bbl. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $49.09 per bbl.
Our production is from properties concentrated in central Oklahoma and in southern Texas. Reserves from each of these areas comprise more than 15% of total reserves. For 2014, approximately 14,391 BO was produced at Marcelina Creek and approximately 66,993 BOE in Oklahoma, or 17% from Marcelina Creek and 78% from Oklahoma.
Quarterly Revenue and Production by State for 2013 and 2014 are detailed as follows:

Drilling Activity and Productive Wells
Marcelina Creek Project - Texas
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company participated in drilling operations of one re-entry and horizontal extension to an existing well bore (50% working interest). This well was recompleted in 2012 as a successful producing oil well.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company drilled one well (75% working interest). This well was successfully completed as an oil well.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company participated in another re-entry and horizontal extension to the same well drilled in 2010 (50% working interest). This operation was successful and the well is currently a producing oil well. We also participated in a re-entry and horizontal extension of another well (40% working interest), the Coulter #1. This well is currently testing as described above. For 2012, in Marcelina Creek the Company had a total of three producing wells at year end
During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company drilled one well in the Marcelina Project (75% working interest). This well was successfully completed as an oil well.
As of December 31, 2014, we had three productive wells in the Marcelina Creek Field (2.00 net wells) and one well which was in the process of being tested in the Coulter Field (.40 net well). Net wells consist of the sum of our fractional working interests in these wells.
Central Oklahoma Projects
During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company began participating in development wells in the Hunton Play. Two producing wells were acquired and three wells were drilled and completed in 2013. During 2014 the Company increased its participation by expanding its lease positions and drilling in the Cimarron, Chisholm Trail, Prairie Grove, and Viking AMI’s. As of December 31, 2014, 10 wells were producing in the Cimarron, 11 wells in the Chisholm Trail, one in Prairie Grove, and one in the Viking. One additional well in the Viking was completing at the end of 2014.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Our acreage positions at December 31, 2014 are summarized as follows:
The Marcelina Creek Project consists of 1,045 gross acres all of which are held by production.
The Orogrande Project was acquired in September, 2014 through a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe is the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional five-year extension provisions
Of the 172,000 acres 40,154 were scheduled for renewal in December, 2014. As of December 31, 2014 the Company had not renewed the leases. The Company is in discussions regarding renewal at the date of this filing.
Prior to March 31, 2015, the Company had the obligation to begin drilling its first well in order to hold the acreage block. The well was permitted and spudded by March 31 and drilling is in progress at date of this filing
The Central Oklahoma Projects acreage is in five AMI’s as of December 31, 2014 with a combined total of 40,392 total gross acres. Producing wells (24) comprise 9,997 gross developed acres with the balance subject to a managed drilling program to retain leases for long term development. The leases have two to three year terms. The drilling program being executed will hold the leases by production within those terms
The Smokey Hills acquisition included approximately 16,000 gross acres and a well, the Hoffman 1-H within the greater Lindsborg Field area. Since development did not continue after the analysis of the Hoffman well and the disappointing results from the initial drilling/testing program in 2014, the acreage position declined from approximately 16,000 acres at acquisition to 960 developed acres at December 31, 2014. The property was offered for sale in the first quarter, 2015.
In October 2013, we entered into a Joint Venture agreement with Ring Energy. The agreement called for us to provide for $6.2 million in drilling capital to, in effect, match Ring Energy’s expenditures for leasing. In exchange for this commitment, we would receive a 50% interest in each well bore drilled and the acreage unit it held, until we had spent $6.2 million. At such time, we would then receive a 50% Working Interest in the entire lease block consisting of 17,000 +/- acres. We were to provide $3.1 million in advance of the program commencing, which would cover approximately 5 wells to be drilled and completed. Once the initial five wells are completed, we and Ring would evaluate the program and the drilling activity and determine if another five wells are to be drilled. Should we continue with the program, we would then deposit another $3.1 million with Ring for drilling and completion of the next five wells
We made the initial $3.1 million deposit and the first five well drilling program is currently underway. Well locations were selected and drilling operations commenced in March, 2014. As of December 31, 2014 seven wells have been drilled - three are producing, one can be converted to a salt water disposal well, one was not completed, and two were plugged and abandoned. A decision has been made to acquire 3-D seismic data to assist the selection of future drill sites. Daily production at December 31, 2014 was approximately 33 BOPD.
As of December 30, 2014, the Company had invested approximately $4,500,000 in the Ring Joint Venture.
Net total gross acres in all areas are 143,996 at December 31, 2014.
