In June 1995, Bradlees filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Bradlees emerged from bankruptcy in January 1999 when its plan of reorganization was confirmed. The Company withdrew its objection to Bradlees' proposed plan of reorganization after obtaining Bradlees' agreement that its lease of the Company's 14th Street and Union Square property would terminate in March 2000. The lease was scheduled to expire in October 2019, and contained an option to renew for an additional ten years. The rent under the lease was increased by $1,100,000 per annum to $3,400,000 per annum from January 1999 to the March 2000 termination date. In connection with the foregoing, the Company paid $11,000,000 to Bradlees.

ALEXANDER'S PROPERTIES
The following table shows as of December 31, 1999 the location, approximate size and leasing status of each of the properties owned by Alexander's, in which the Company has a 32.0% interest.
- ------------------- (1) Excludes parking garages.
(2) Excludes 339,000 square foot Macy's store, owned and operated by Federated Department Stores, Inc. ("Federated").
(3) Leased by the Company through January 2027.
Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center:
In June 1998, Alexander's increased its interest in the Mall to 100% by acquiring Federated Department Stores's 50% interest. The purchase price was approximately $28,000,000, which was paid in cash, plus Alexander's agreed to pay Federated $15,000,000 to renovate its Macy's store in the Mall and Federated agreed to certain modifications to the Kings Plaza Operating Agreement. Alexander's is currently renovating the Mall in connection with the overall renovation of the Center at an estimated cost of $33,000,000 of which $9,045,000 has been expended as of January 31, 2000. The renovation is expected to be completed in 2000.
Paramus:
Alexander's intends to develop a shopping center of approximately 550,000 square feet on this site. The estimated cost of such redevelopment is approximately $100,000,000. Alexander's has received municipal approvals on tentative plans to develop the site. No redevelopment plans have been finalized.
Lexington Avenue:
Alexander's is currently undertaking the excavation and laying the foundation for its Lexington Avenue property as part of the proposed development of a large multi-use building. The proposed building is expected to be comprised of a commercial portion, which may include retail stores, offices, hotel space, extended-stay residences, residential rentals and parking; and a residential portion, consisting of condominium units to be sold to the public. In connection therewith, Alexander's paid $14,500,000 for 140,000 square feet of air rights of which $12,200,000 was paid to the Company (Vornado's cost plus $243,000 in interest and closing costs). The air rights were contracted for and paid for in 1999, with closings to take place when the developments which give rise to the air rights are completed in 2000. The capital required for the proposed building will be in excess of $400,000,000.
Because a REIT is subject to 100% excise tax on income derived from the sales of "dealer property" (i.e. condominiums), the air rights representing the residential portion of the property are being transferred to a preferred stock affiliate, a corporation in which Alexander's owns all of the preferred equity and none of the common equity. The transfer value will be adjusted once the final size of the residential portion is determined.
While Alexander's anticipates that financing will be available after tenants have been obtained for these projects, there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained, or if obtained, that such financings will be on terms that are acceptable. In addition, it is uncertain as to when these projects will commence.
HOTEL PENNSYLVANIA
On August 5, 1999, the Company increased its interest in the Hotel Pennsylvania to 100% by acquiring Planet Hollywood International, Inc.'s ("Planet Hollywood") 20% interest in the hotel for approximately $18,000,000 and assumed $24,000,000 of existing debt. In connection with the transaction, the Company terminated the licensing agreement with Planet Hollywood for an Official All-Star Hotel. The Hotel Pennsylvania is located in New York City on Seventh Avenue opposite Madison Square Garden. The Company intends to refurbish the Hotel. Under the terms of the mortgage on this property, in connection with the refurbishment, the Company has escrowed $15,000,000 in cash and provided $29,000,000 through letters of credit. The Hotel Pennsylvania contains approximately 800,000 square feet of hotel space with 1,700 rooms and approximately 400,000 square feet of retail and office space. The Company manages the property's retail and office space, and a preferred stock affiliate of the Company co-manages the hotel.
