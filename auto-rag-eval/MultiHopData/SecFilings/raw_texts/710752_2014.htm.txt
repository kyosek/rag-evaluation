Item 2. Properties.
The assets of the Registrant consist principally of the Royalty Properties, which constitute interests in gross production of oil, gas and other minerals free of the costs of production. The Royalty Properties consist of royalty and mineral interests, including landowner’s royalties, overriding royalty interests, minerals (other than executive rights, bonuses and delay rentals), production payments and any
other similar, nonparticipatory interest, in certain producing and proved undeveloped oil and gas properties located in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. These properties are represented by approximately 5,400 tracts of land. Approximately 2,950 of the tracts are in Oklahoma, 1,750 in Texas, 330 in Louisiana, 200 in New Mexico, 150 in Mississippi and 12 in Florida.
The following table summarizes total developed and proved undeveloped acreage represented by the Royalty Properties at December 31, 2014.
Detailed information concerning the number of wells on royalty properties is not generally available to the owner of royalty interests. Consequently, the Registrant does not have information that would be disclosed by a company with oil and gas operations, such as an accurate count of the number of wells located on the Royalty Properties, the number of exploratory or development wells drilled on the Royalty Properties during the periods presented by this report, or the number of wells in process or other present activities on the Royalty Properties, and the Registrant cannot readily obtain such information.
Title
The conveyances of the Royalty Properties to the Trust covered the royalty and mineral properties located in the six states that were vested in Sabine Corporation on the effective date of the conveyances and that were subject to existing oil, gas and other mineral leases other than properties specifically excluded in the conveyances. Since Sabine Corporation may not have had available to it as a royalty owner information as to whether specific lands in which it owned a royalty interest were subject to an existing lease, minimal amounts of nonproducing royalty properties may also have been conveyed to the Trust. Sabine Corporation did not warrant title to the Royalty Properties either expressly or by implication.
Reserves
The Registrant has obtained from DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineering consultants, a study of the proved oil and gas reserves attributable as of January 1, 2015 to the Royalty Properties. The following letter report summarizes such reserve study and sets forth information as to the assumptions, qualifications, procedures and other matters relating to such reserve study. Because the only assets of the Trust are the Royalty Properties, the Trustee believes the reserve study provides useful information for Unit holders. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production. The reserve data set forth herein, although prepared by independent petroleum engineers in a manner customary in the industry, are estimates only, and actual quantities and values of oil and gas are likely to differ from the estimated amounts set forth herein. In addition, the reserve estimates for the Royalty Properties will be affected by future changes in sales prices for oil and gas produced. See Note 8 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 hereof for additional information regarding the proved oil and gas reserves of the Trust. Other than those filed with the SEC, our estimated reserves have not been filed with or included in any reports to any federal agency.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment. As a result, the Trustee has developed internal policies and controls for estimating reserves attributable to the Trust. As described above, the Trust does not have information that would be available to a company with oil and gas operations because detailed information is not generally available to owners of royalty interests. The Trustee gathers production information (which information is net to the Trust’s interests in the Royalty Properties) and provides such information to DeGolyer and MacNaughton, who extrapolates from such information estimates of the reserves
attributable to the Royalty Properties based on its expertise in the oil and gas fields where the Royalty Properties are situated, as well as publicly available information. The Trust’s policies regarding reserve estimates require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton, the independent petroleum engineering consultants who prepared the reserve study, have provided petroleum consulting services for more than 70 years. Paul J. Szatkowski, a Senior Vice President with DeGolyer and MacNaughton, was the primary engineer responsible for the report. Mr. Szatkowski’s qualifications are set forth in the Certificate of Qualification attached to the letter report below.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Pursuant to your request, we have prepared estimates of the extent and value of the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas reserves, as of January 1, 2015, of certain properties that Sabine Royalty Trust (the Trust) has represented that it owns. This evaluation was prepared for the purpose of reporting estimates of the Trust’s reserves and associated future net revenue. This evaluation was completed on February 20, 2015. The properties appraised consist of royalties located in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Southwest Bank (Southwest Bank) acts as trustee of the Trust. Southwest Bank has represented that these properties account for 100 percent of revenues attributed to royalty interest payments received by the Trust as of January 1, 2015. The properties appraised account for 100 percent of the Trust’s proved reserves. The net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by the Trust.
Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2014. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by the Trust after deducting all interests owned by others.
Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as that portion of the total gas to be delivered into a gas pipeline for sale after separation, processing, fuel use, and flare. Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and at the legal pressure base of the state in which the interest is located. Condensate reserves estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation. NGL reserves are those attributed to the leasehold interests according to processing agreements.
Values shown herein are expressed in terms of future gross revenue, future net revenue, and present worth. Future gross revenue is that revenue which will accrue to the appraised interests from the production and sale of the estimated net reserves. Future net revenue is calculated by deducting estimated production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and expenses including, but not limited to, treating, compression and marketing expenses incurred on the Trust’s royalty interests from the future gross revenue. Future income tax expenses were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. Present worth is defined as future net revenue discounted at a specified arbitrary discount rate compounded monthly over the expected period of realization. Present worth should not be construed as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought and sold.
Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas reserves and future net revenue should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such reserves and revenue estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
Data used in this evaluation were obtained from reviews with Southwest Bank personnel, from Southwest Bank files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources. Additionally, this information includes data supplied by IHS Global Inc.; Copyright 2015 IHS Global Inc. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Southwest Bank with respect to property interests owned by the Trust, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report.
Methodology and Procedures
Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
An analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of reserves. For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production or to the limit of the production licenses as appropriate.
In certain cases, when the previously named methods could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.
The Trust owns several thousand royalty interests. In view of the limited information available to a royalty owner and the small reserves volumes attributable to many of these interests, certain of the reserves representing approximately 22 percent of the total net reserves of the properties included herein were summarized by state or field and estimated in the aggregate rather than on a property-by-property basis. Historical records of net production and revenue and experience with similar properties were used in evaluating these properties.
Undeveloped reserves were estimated for certain properties based on industry activity on and adjacent to these certain properties as well as other public knowledge concerning the future development of certain properties. These undeveloped reserves represent only 6 percent of the total net reserves evaluated herein.
Definition of Reserves
Petroleum reserves included in this report are classified as proved. Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves - Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Developed oil and gas reserves - Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves - Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4-10 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Primary Economic Assumptions
Revenue values in this report were estimated using the initial prices and expenses provided by Southwest Bank. The following economic assumptions were used for estimating existing and future prices and costs:
Oil, Condensate, NGL, and Natural Gas Prices
Oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas prices are based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. A West Texas Intermediate oil reference price of $95.28 per barrel and a Henry Hub gas reference price of $4.35 per million British thermal units were used for this evaluation. The prices were held constant thereafter and were not escalated for inflation.
Based on royalty receipts received by the Trust, as provided by Southwest Bank, various oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas price differentials based on product quality and property location were determined for each property. These differentials were then applied to the above reference prices, respectively, to reflect the net wellhead prices anticipated to be received by each property.
The volume-weighted average prices attributable to estimated proved reserves over the lives of the properties were $89.83 per barrel of oil and condensate, $4.365 per thousand cubic feet of gas, and $30.46 per barrel of NGL.
Operating Expenses and Capital Costs
The properties appraised are royalties. Therefore, no operating expenses or capital costs are incurred. The expenses reported are primarily severance taxes and ad valorem taxes, which are based on historical tax rates furnished by Southwest Bank. Several properties incur additional expenses related to transportation, marketing, and/or other expenses that are charged to the royalty interests. These expenses are reported as transportation expenses. No escalation has been applied to the expenses.
While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant’s ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the January 1, 2015, estimated oil and gas reserves.
Our estimates of the Trust’s net proved reserves, as of January 1, 2015, attributable to the reviewed properties are based on the definitions of proved reserves of the SEC and are summarized by geographic area as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl) and millions of cubic feet (MMcf):
A projection of the estimated future net revenue from the properties appraised, as of January 1, 2015, based on the aforementioned assumptions concerning prices and expenses is summarized as follows, expressed in thousands of dollars (M$):
* Future income tax expenses were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
The present worth at a discount rate of 10 percent of future net revenue, as of January 1, 2015, is estimated to be M$260,964.
In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves, estimated future net revenue from proved reserves, and present worth of estimated future net revenue from proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, 932-235-50-9, 932-235-50-30, and
932-235-50-31(a), (b), and (e) of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that (i) future income tax expenses have not been taken into account in estimating the future net revenue and present worth values set forth herein, (ii) estimates of the proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year (January 1, 2014), and (iii) at the request of Southwest Bank and because of the limited availability of data, estimates of proved reserves, future net revenue therefrom, and the present worth values set forth herein for certain royalty interests accounting for approximately 22 percent of the Trust’s total proved net reserves have been estimated in the aggregate by state or area rather than on a property-by-property basis using net production and revenue data and our general knowledge of producing characteristics in the geographic areas in which such interests are located.
To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1936.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development. The preceding reserve data in the letter regarding the study represent estimates only and should not be construed to be exact. The estimated present worth of future net revenue amounts shown by the study should not be construed as the current fair market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves since a market value determination would include many additional factors.
Reserve estimates may be adjusted from time to time as more accurate information on the volume or recoverability of existing reserves becomes available. Actual reserve quantities do not change, however, except through production. The Trust continues to own only the Royalty Properties that were initially transferred to the Trust at the time of its creation and is prohibited by the Trust Agreement from acquiring additional oil and gas interests.
The future net revenue shown by the study has not been reduced for administrative costs and expenses of the Trust in future years. The costs and expenses of the Trust may increase in future years, depending on the amount of income from the Royalty Properties, increases in the Trustee’s fees (including escrow agent fees) and expenses, accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees, and other factors. It is expected that the costs and expenses of the Trust in 2015 will be approximately $2,656,500.
The present value of future net revenue of the Trust’s proved developed reserves increased from $258,163,043 at January 1, 2014 to $260,964,013 at January 1, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the natural gas prices used in the calculation of such amount, from an average price of $3.64 per Mcf at January 1, 2014 to an average price of $4.37 per Mcf at January 1, 2015. This increase was offset somewhat by a decrease in the oil prices used in calculating the present value of future net revenue from $92.11 per barrel at January 1, 2014 to an average price of $89.83 per barrel at January 1, 2015.
Subsequent to year end, the price of both oil and gas continued to fluctuate, giving rise to a correlating adjustment of the respective standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. As of February 17, 2015, NYMEX posted oil prices were approximately $53.53 per barrel, which compared to the average posted price of $95.28 per barrel, used to calculate the worth of future net revenue of the Trust’s proved developed reserves, would result in a decrease in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for oil. As of February 17, 2015, NYMEX posted gas prices were $2.75 per million British thermal units. The use of such price, as compared to the average posted price of $4.35 per million British thermal units, used to calculate the future net revenue for the Trust’s proved developed reserves would result in a decrease in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for gas.
The volatile nature of the world energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas. The prices obtained for oil and gas depend upon numerous factors, none of which is within the Trustee’s control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas and the price of foreign imports, market demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the availability of pipeline capacity, instability in oil-producing regions and the effect of governmental regulations.
