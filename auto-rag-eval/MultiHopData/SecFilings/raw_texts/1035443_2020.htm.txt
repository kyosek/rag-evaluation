ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2020, we had 338 properties in North America containing approximately 35.2 million RSF of operating properties and development and redevelopment of new Class A properties (under construction), including 40 properties that are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and six properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Refer to the definitions of “Annual rental revenue” and “Operating statistics” in the “Non-GAAP measures and definitions” section under “Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of the basis used to compute the aforementioned measures. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 94.6% as of December 31, 2020. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science, technology, and agtech tenants. These improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:
•Reinforced concrete floors;
•Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•Enhanced environmental control technology;
•Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•Laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2020, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of 36 properties in North America that accounted for approximately 11% of our total number of properties. Of these 36 properties, we held 16 properties in the Greater Boston market, 13 properties in the San Francisco market, two properties in the New York City market, two properties in the Seattle market, one property in the Maryland market, and two properties in the Research Triangle market pursuant to ground leasehold interests. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our ground lease rental expense aggregated 1.4% as a percentage of net operating income. Refer to further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and financial statement schedules” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 909 leases with a total of 670 tenants, and 167, or 49%, of our 338 properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of four to 11 years, while leases in our single-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of 11 to 21 years. As of December 31, 2020:
•Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented 55% of our total annual rental revenue;
•Approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from approximately 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index;
•Approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent; and
•Approximately 93% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of capital expenditures (such as HVAC maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.

Leasing activity
•Executed a total of 244 leases, with a weighted-average lease term of 7.3 years, for 4.4 million RSF, including 1.0 million RSF related to our development and redevelopment projects, during the year ended December 31, 2020; leasing activity of 2.6 million RSF of renewed and re-leased space represents the highest annual leasing activity in the past 10 years; and
•Strong rental rate increases of 37.6% and 18.3% (cash basis) on renewed and re-leased space, representing our highest annual increase during the past 10 years.
Approximately 59% of the 244 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2020, did not include concessions for free rent. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we granted tenant concessions/free rent averaging 2.1 months with respect to the 4.4 million RSF leased.
The following chart presents renewed/re-leased space and development/redevelopment/previously vacant space leased for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
Lease structure
Our Same Properties total revenue growth of 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Same Properties net operating income and Same Properties net operating income (cash basis) increases for the year ended December 31, 2020, of 2.6% and 5.1%, respectively, benefited significantly from strong market fundamentals. The limited supply of Class A space in AAA locations and strong demand from innovative tenants drove rental rate increases of 37.6% and 18.3% (cash basis) on 2.6 million renewed/re-leased RSF, while a favorable triple net lease structure with contractual annual rent escalations resulted in both a consistent Same Properties operating margin of 73.0% and occupancy of 96.6% across our 209 Same Properties aggregating 20.7 million RSF. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained contractual annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 93% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Investments in real estate
A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new Class A properties located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our pre-construction activities are undertaken in order to get the property ready for its intended use and include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements.
As of the date of this report, construction activities were in process at all of our active construction projects. Construction workers continue to observe social distancing and follow rules that restrict gatherings of large groups of people in close proximity, as
well as adhere to other appropriate measures, which may slow the pace of construction.
Our investments in real estate consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)Balances exclude our share of the cost basis associated with our properties held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, which is classified as investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in our consolidated balance sheets.

Our real estate asset acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
(1)The campus includes 16 properties, of which three properties aggregating 652,381 RSF are currently undergoing active redevelopment. We expect to achieve unlevered initial stabilized yields of 6.2% and 5.8% (cash basis) for the 13 operating properties. These operating properties generate 99% of annual rental revenue from investment-grade tenants. Refer to “New Class A development and redevelopment properties: current projects” within this Item 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details on the three properties undergoing active redevelopment.

We received gross proceeds of $51.1 million for the 50% interest in the properties that our joint venture partner acquired through the joint venture. We continue to control and consolidate this joint venture; therefore, we accounted for the sale as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized in earnings. Refer to the next page for additional information.
