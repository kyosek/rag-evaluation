Item 2. Properties
Our principal corporate offices, administrative, sales and marketing, research and development and support facilities are located at 15875 S.W. 72nd Avenue, Portland, Oregon, 97224 and consist of approximately 7,000 square feet of leased office and laboratory space.
We believe our properties are adequate for our current needs.
PART II
Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
Trading Market
Our common stock, par value $0.03 per share, is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”) under the symbol “CBMC.” High and low quotations reported by the OTCBB are shown below. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions and may not represent actual transactions.
On April 22, 2011, there were approximately 297 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock on April 22, 2011 was $0.03 per share. We have never paid any cash dividends, and our Board does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any future earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of our business.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&A should also be read in conjunction with Item 1.A. “Risk Factors.”
This MD&A contains forward-looking statements regarding our business development plans, the characteristics and growth of our markets and customers; our objectives and plans for future operations and products and our liquidity and capital resources. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of terms such as “anticipate,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “should” or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements express our current intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies or predictions and are based on a number of assumptions and currently available information. Although we believe that the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements contained herein are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate given the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including, without limitation, our ability to obtain an increased market share in the diagnostic test market; market acceptance of our products by governmental and other public health agencies, health care providers and consumers; the success of our future marketing and brand-building efforts; FDA and international regulatory actions; our ability to protect our proprietary technologies; the further development of our technologies and products; our ability to compete successfully against existing and new competitors; our future financial and operating results; our liquidity and capital resources; our ability to obtain additional financing as necessary to fund both our short- and long-term business plans; our ability to terminate or reduce our debt obligations; changes in domestic or international conditions beyond our control that may disrupt our or our customers’ or distributors’ ability to meet contractual obligations; changes in health care policy in the United States or abroad; fluctuations in market demand for and supply of our products; public concern as to the safety of products that we or others develop and public concern regarding HIV and AIDS; availability of reimbursement for use of our products from private health insurers; governmental health administration authorities and other third-party payors; our ability to attract or retain key personnel and various other matters (including contingent liabilities and obligations and changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations).
Overview of Critical Events in 2010
In 2010 we were able to secure modest funding from two investors which enabled us to sustain our existing products as well as complete the prototype for Aware II, our new product for the US and western markets. While we were not successful in securing long term agreements, these two investors invested a total of $680,000 in advances that were converted to stock purchases after our fiscal year-end upon completion of pending subscription agreements.
With the limited funding available we focused on sustaining our products and operations in the US as well as building a prototype rapid test for the US and western markets. New competition in the BED product segment affected our ability to sell this product and resulted in reduced revenues.
In 2010 we continued our engagement with our distributors as well as initiating strategic projects in Russia and UAE. Our AwareTM HIV-1/2 OMT sales were down 9% from 2009. Most of our AwareTM HIV-1/2 OMT Rapid Tests sales were in Africa, through our South African distributor. Local sales of our rapid test in China were insignificant during 2010 as our financial constraints limited the operations of our JV in China.
In 2010 we experienced competition for our BED Incidence Test for the first time. This led to a 55% decrease in our BED sales revenue from 2009. Sales of BED Incidence Test accounted for 57% of our revenues in 2010 and posted a 55% revenue decrease compared with 2009. Such sales tend to be irregular as public health and research institutions begin or conclude various studies to monitor the incidence of HIV infection within their subject populations. Our Aware MessengerTM oral fluid sample collection device and our Life Sciences reagents, accounted for than 12% of our 2010 sales.
Business Environment
Although we have received regulatory approval in a number of countries, there is a long lag time between regulatory approval and sales. In our target markets, government ministries of health or similar government and nongovernmental agencies are the primary purchasers of our products, typically through a “lowest-cost” tender process. These purchasers have historically purchased blood-based HIV tests. We have had to overcome the obstacle of changing these purchasers’ mindsets from preferring tests that use the current blood standard of care. We have expended much time, money and effort to try to convince government bodies and non-governmental organizations to try our oral fluid tests, both for its ease of use, efficiency and lower-cost benefits.
We consider these efforts to be part of a strategy in which the “standard of care” for HIV diagnosis evolves from the exclusive use of blood tests to more widespread use of non-invasive oral fluid-based tests. If we can successfully change the standard of care, we expect to reach a point at which our revenue will increase significantly. We cannot forecast whether or when this point will occur, as it is largely governed by factors beyond our control.
We believe the demand for fast, easy-to-use HIV tests is strong and growing. By many accounts, governments are requiring more testing for HIV and allocating more funds to such testing, non-governmental organizations and charities have increased their funding for HIV testing too. Although we face barriers to market acceptance, we have started making inroads especially in a few African countries. Although we are unable to predict future demand for our products, we believe that we will are well-positioned to increase market acceptance of our products and our market share.
Outlook
In July 2010 we entered into a series of agreements providing for (i) the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital Partners Limited (“SF Capital”), (ii) the transfer of our ownership interests in one of our Chinese joint ventures, Beijing Marr, to Kangplus and (iii) the transfer of our ownership interests in or other Chinese joint venture, Beijing Calypte, to Marr or a designate of its choice. In October 2010, we issued common stock to SF Capital pursuant to our debt restructuring agreement. The transfer of our ownership interests in the Chinese joint ventures are awaiting approval by Chinese governmental authorities.
We do not have any long term agreement for capital infusion at this point in time. As our cash flows from our operating and investing activities are currently not adequate to sustain our operations, if we are unable to raise capital, we will likely be unable to continue our operations. Failure to obtain additional financing and to resolve the existing defaults with respect to the Credit Facility and the Convertible Notes will likely cause us to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., which would have a material adverse effect on our business, on our ability to continue our operations and on the value of our equity.
Management believes that we have the ability to sustain our operations, at least for the near-term, through effective management of our operations and the ability to raise additional capital through private placements of equity. However, if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we will be unable to meet our operating and trade debt obligations and will likely be unable to continue our operations.
We believe that certain factors are critical to our success, including having sufficient financial liquidity to fund our operations; raising additional funds through the private placement of equity; continuing to expand our marketing and increasing sales of our products; and developing a larger international market presence.
Since 2003 we have developed and brought to market our AwareTM Rapid Test Product Line and Aware MessengerTM Oral Fluid Sample Collection Device and have either developed or have the technology to develop next generation HIV test products and additional diagnostic test products based on our technology and test platform. These critical additions to our product base over the past few years have positioned us to grow our business and to achieve better margins as we move into the market for HIV tests. These products are the core of our business and the key to our future success.
In order to accomplish our business plan and meet our financial obligations, we must:
- Raise additional capital to fund working capital requirements.
- Reduce accounts payable and other debt and associated fixed costs.
- Increase marketing and sales of our products through our current and new distribution network.
- Successfully conduct the clinical trial for our Aware II product
We have been actively pursuing potential opportunities to address the above matters, the ultimate resolution of which is beyond our control and will have a significant impact on our financial condition and ability to continue our operations. As a result, no assurances can be given that these transactions will be completed as contemplated or at all, which could have a detrimental effect on our ability to continue our operations. For more information regarding our business plan and these transactions, see "Item 1. Business - General, Requirements of Additional Capital and Business Plan" and for the related risks, see "Risk Factors" below.
As 2011 begins, we remain focused on our strategy of increasing marketing and sales in the countries where our products are registered, seeking additional product registrations in countries where we have a high likelihood of making sales, planning for the clinical trials of Aware II and keeping our operations costs low.
Aware TM BED Incidence Test
We began selling the BED Incidence Test in the fourth quarter of 2004. It accounted for approximately 58% and 79% of our sales in calendar years 2010 and 2009, respectively. In absolute terms, revenue from the sale of the Incidence Test decreased by approximately 55% between 2009 and 2010; this was primarily due to the new competition we now have for this product.
Aware TM HIV 1/2OMT Rapid Tests
Sales of our HIV-1/2 OMT rapid diagnostic tests accounted for approximately 30% of our revenues in 2010 compared with 21% in 2009. We expect that our future near- and medium-term revenues will be derived primarily from selling our HIV-1/2 rapid tests in both the professional and over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
AwareTM MessengerTM Sampling Device
Our Aware MessengerTM oral fluid sample collection device and our Life Sciences reagents, both introduced during early 2008, accounted for approximately 12% of our 2010 sales.
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
During 2010 and 2009, we used cash of $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in our operations. In both periods, the cash used in operations was primarily for development and commercialization of our rapid tests, as well as for our selling, general and administrative expenses.
The following summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
Our revenue for 2010 totaled $444,000 compared with $726,000 for 2009, a decrease of $282,000 or 39%. Sales of our BED Incidence Test accounted for 57% of our sales in 2010, compared with 79% in 2009. Revenue from the sales of the BED Incidence Test decreased by 55% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily driven by newfound competition for this product line. Such sales tend to be irregular as public health and research institutions begin or conclude various studies to monitor the incidence of HIV infection within their subject populations. Sales of our AwareTM HIV-1/2 rapid tests accounted for 30% and 21% of our revenues for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenues from the sale of our HIV-1/2 rapid tests decreased by 7% in 2010 compared with revenues in 2009, primarily due to economic conditions. Our Aware MessengerTM oral fluid sample collection device and our Life Sciences reagents, both introduced during early 2008, accounted for 12% of our 2010 sales.
Three customers accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue for 2010. Our South African distributor purchased both BED Incidence Tests and our AwareTM HIV-1/2 oral fluid rapid tests representing 29% of our 2010 revenue. The two other US customers who purchased the BED Incidence Test purchases accounted for 14% and 10% of our 2010 revenue. In 2009, our South African distributor purchased both BED Incidence Tests and our AwareTM HIV-1/2 oral fluid rapid tests representing 23% of our 2009 revenue. A Chinese customer and New York customer accounted for 16% and 10% of 2009 revenue.
We reported a gross margin of 41% of sales in 2010, compared with a gross margin 46% in 2009. Margins are down due to reduced sales volumes and increased shipping costs and costs of goods sold. The margins we reported in both 2010 and 2009, however, are not typical of our expected future results because of the relatively nominal amounts of revenues and product quantities over which the quality systems costs and certain fixed expenses, like annual royalty minimum payments, have been allocated. Product costs in both periods are based on resource-constrained purchasing patterns and pilot-plant-sized production lots, and do not reflect the economies of scale that we anticipate when we achieve true commercial scale operations.
Research and development costs increased by $89,000 or 46%, from $193,000 in 2009 to $282,000 in 2010. R&D expense increase is primarily due to the ramping up the R&D spending as we work on a new product. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $398,000, or 31% from $1,397,000 in 2009 to $999,000 in 2010. The primary components of the net decrease in 2010 include the following:
·
$208,000 in non-recurring legal fees incurred in 2009 in connection with litigation that was settled in March 2010
·
A $120,000 decrease in salary and benefit expense attributable to stock option forfeiture
·
A $40,000 decrease in overhead due to reduced rent costs as a result of lease renegotiation and move to a new location
·
A $30,000 decrease in tax and audit fees
Our 2010 net income was $9.0 million, compared to a loss of $3.6 million in 2009. This net income increase reflects restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital and the associated transfer of our Chinese joint ventures.
We recorded net interest expense of $545,000 in 2010 compared with net interest expense of $1,592,000 in 2009. The decrease in interest expense primarily results from the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital.
The following table summarizes the components of interest expense (in thousands):
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred a net income of $9.0 million but a negative cash flow of $0.7 million. At December 31, 2010, we had a working capital deficit of $3.5 million and our stockholders’ deficit was $5.1 million. Our cash balance at December 31, 2010 was $0.1 million.
Our consolidated operating cash burn rate for 2010 averaged approximately $57,000 per month compared to approximately $88,000 per month in 2009. Our decreased burn rate for 2010 reflects our efforts to significantly reduce or eliminate the expenditures required to ramp up marketing and manufacturing initiatives to achieve our near-term milestones.
During 2010, two of our existing investors advanced funds aggregating $680,000 to us in anticipation of a financing agreement. As of the date of this filing, we do not have definitive agreements with these investors regarding the terms of these advances.
Liquidity Needs and our Business Plan
We are taking steps to address our capital requirements for financial liquidity and have developed a business plan that we believe will provide us with sufficient financial resources to continue to conduct our operations. See "Item 1. Business - General, Requirements of Additional Capital and Business Plan" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outlook " for more details on our plan. However, no assurances can be given that we will successfully accomplish the objectives of our plan.
We believe that we will continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities through 2011. We have financed our operations from our inception primarily through the private placements of preferred stock and common stock, our initial public offering and the issuance of convertible notes and debentures. Due to our historical operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity. We do not have sufficient capital resources to fund our operations beyond the very near-term. We presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Additional financing is required in order to meet our current and projected cash flow deficits from operations. In order to obtain financing, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock, other equity or debt securities or borrow funds from private lenders. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend upon the status of capital markets and industry conditions. Moreover, it may be difficult, or impossible, for us to raise additional capital because our stock price has often traded at below its par value and because we may not have sufficient shares of authorized stock to issue to investors. If we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not successful in generating sufficient liquidity from operations or in raising sufficient capital resources, on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
We may experience fluctuations in operating results in future periods due to a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing in a timely manner and on terms favorable to us, our ability to successfully implement our business plan and execute our business model, the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and the implementation of marketing programs, key agreements, and strategic alliances, and general economic conditions as well as those specific to our industry.
Our independent accountants have stated in their report dated May 20,2011 that our recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring costs, derivative and anti-dilution liabilities and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
·
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to customers and when all requirements related to the shipments have occurred. Should changes in terms cause us to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
·
Inventory Valuation. We adjust the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions and development of new products by our competitors. Further, we also review our inventories for lower of cost or market valuation.
·
Deferred Tax Asset Realization. We record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
·
Classification of Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liability and Equity. We account for financial instruments that we have issued and that have characteristics of both liability and equity in accordance with SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, as codified by FASB ASC topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”). SFAS No. 150 specifies that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments are to be recorded as liabilities unless the redemption is required to occur upon the liquidation or termination of the issuer. SFAS No. 150 also specifies that a financial instrument that embodies a conditional obligation that an issuer may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares is to be classified as a liability if, at inception, the value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares. Should a financial instrument not be classified as a liability under the provisions of SFAS No. 150, we further apply the criteria in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock, as codified by FASB ASC topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which enumerates additional criteria to determine the appropriate classification as liability or equity. We also evaluate the anti-dilution and/or beneficial conversion features that may be included in our financial instruments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as codified by ASC 815, which may classify the feature as an embedded derivative and require that the financial instrument be bifurcated and the feature accounted for separately. We evaluate each financial instrument on its own merits at inception or other prescribed measurement or valuation dates and may engage the services of valuation experts and other professionals to assist us in our determination of the appropriate classification.. . . . . .
·
Stock based compensation. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”) as codified in FASB ASC topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), effective January 1, 2006. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, which requires that we apply the provisions of SFAS 123R to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. We recognized the unrecognized expense attributable to awards not fully vested at our January 1, 2006 date of adoption in our net loss during 2006 and 2007 using the same valuation method (i.e. Black-Scholes) and assumptions determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as disclosed on a pro-forma basis in our previous financial statements. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, we recognize stock-based compensation, net of an estimated forfeiture rate which results in recognizing compensation expense for only those awards expected to vest, over the service period of the award. Since our adoption of SFAS 123R, we have estimated the fair value of options granted to employees and directors, and we expect to estimate the fair value of future grants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price volatility, and pre-vesting option forfeitures. To date, we have generally estimated the expected life of options granted based on the simplified method provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 for “plain vanilla” options. Where appropriate, we will consider separately for valuation purposes groups of employees or directors that have similar historical exercise behavior. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on its historical volatility over a period generally equivalent to the expected term of the grant. We estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and recognize expense for only those shares expected to vest. We have estimated our forfeiture rate based on our historical experience with stock-based awards that are granted and forfeited prior to vesting. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could also differ from what we have recorded in the current period. As required under ASC 718, we will review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, may periodically change the valuation assumptions used to value employee stock-based awards granted in future periods.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition), or ASU 2009-13, and ASU 2009-14, Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985, Software), or ASU 2009-14, ASU 2009-13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy, The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU 2009-14 removed tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of these statements effective January 1, 2011 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 are included on pages through of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(1) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and financial officer (our “CEO”) of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). This evaluation identified a deficiency in our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to accounting procedures utilized by our Chinese subsidiaries, Beijing Calypte and Beijing Marr, and their reporting to us of financial and other material information. Based on this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Moreover, our CEO has determined that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
As a result of our evaluation, we determined that we did not have adequate controls and procedures with respect to our Chinese subsidiaries and we were unable to adequately disclose financial and other material information or to do so in a timely manner. Beijing Marr and Beijing Calypte employed a single financial manager for both companies who resigned in the first quarter of 2008. Because of financial constraints, this position has since remained vacant. There are no personnel at Beijing Marr or Beijing Calypte with sufficient understanding and skills in the application of U.S. GAAP or in U.S. public company reporting obligations to prepare proper financial statements or provide us with other material information to enable us to properly account for and disclose both financial and other material information. The absence of qualified financial personnel at our Chinese subsidiaries has precluded proper monitoring of the financial results of those operations and timely preparation of sufficient and accurate financial statements, rendering our efforts to apply controls over the completeness and accuracy of our Chinese subsidiaries financial statements, closing processes relating to reconciliations, journal entries, spreadsheets, reporting packages and review and preparation of monthly expenditure reports ineffective.
Because of the limited level of activity in which our Chinese subsidiaries were engaged during the year ended December 31, 2009, there were no material adjustments required to the financial information ultimately prepared by those subsidiaries. After we entered into the Debt Agreement with Marr and the Equity Agreement with Marr and Kangplus in July 2010, we began reporting the results of Beijing Marr and Beijing Calypte as discontinued operations. As we no longer consolidate our results with those of these entities, we no longer consider their internal controls to be relevant to Calypte’s operations going forward.
(2) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010:
We did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation for the discipline and structure necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i) lack of segregation of duties over individuals responsible for certain key control activities; (ii) an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control monitoring activities, including the recognition of the risks and complexities of transactions; and (iii) an insufficient number of personnel, such as absence of permanent chief financial officer, with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience or training in the application of GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. This control environment material weakness contributed to the company not having effective controls to ensure an effective financial statement close process such that financial statements are completed and prepared in a timely manner.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements should they occur. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the control procedure may deteriorate.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.
PART III
Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance
Following is a list of our directors and executive officers as of April 28, 2010. Directors serve until the next annual meeting stockholders and until their successors are elected or until their earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal.
Adel Karas was appointed to our Board of Directors in May 2007. In March 2009, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Karas as our interim Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, to act our principal executive officer, president and principal financial officer. In February 2010, Mr. Karas was formally elected as the our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Since December 2005 Mr. Karas has worked as the Regional Director (Asia, Africa & Middle East) for the World Agency of Planetary Monitoring & Earthquake Risk Reduction (WAPMERR) based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). WAPMERR is involved with disaster management and risk assessments. Prior to his involvement with WAPMERR, in 2003 Mr. Karas co-founded and served as Managing Director of Strategic Energy Investment Group in Dubai. He started this group following his retirement from Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) in Houston, Texas where he served as Senior Vice President of Business Development for two years before moving to Dubai where he set up and, for the next eight years, served as President of PGS for the Middle East Region. Mr. Karas served, as well, as the executive vice president for Grant Tensor Geophysical in Houston-Texas and as the president of Tensor Geophysical in Egypt. Mr. Karas attended AinShams University, University of Texas and University of Houston. He holds degrees in Geophysics and Operations Research as well as a Masters Degree in electrical engineering and an MBA.
Tareq Al Yousefi was appointed to our Board of Directors in September 2009. He is the founder and chief executive officer of Gulf Access LLC, a consultancy company for petro chemical, real estate and industrial projects, where he has served since 2005. In addition, since 2006, he has been a partner in Polymer Access Pvt. Ltd., which is also involved in petro chemical. Since 1999, he has served as a market analyst to Borouge Pte. Ltd., a joint venture between ADNOC and Borealis, a leading international petro chemical company.

During his seven year stay in the United States he earned a degree in Business Administration, a degree in Aircraft Engineering and a private pilot’s license. He started his career as an United Arab Emirates air force officer and was trained in the United Kingdom at RAF Cranwell. Mr. Al Yousefi speaks English, Arabic and Urdu.
Kartlos Edilashvili was appointed to our Board of Directors in February 2010. Mr. Edilashvili has served as a vice president of a subsidiary of ours in Geneva, Switzerland since August 2007. From 2005 to 2007 he was a Senior Technical Advisor of WAPMERR in Geneva. Prior thereto, he served as First Secretary for the Embassy of Georgia in Geneva. Mr. Edilashvili holds an MA in finances from Tbilisi State University.
The Board of Directors and Its Committees
In the past, the Board of Directors had established three standing committees, the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee. However, in light of personnel changes on the Board during 2009, those committees are no longer active and do not have any members other than Mr. Karas, who is a member of the Nominating Committee.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (“Section 16(a)”) requires our executive officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our Common Stock (collectively, “Reporting Persons”) to file reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the SEC. Such Reporting Persons are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, during the year ended December 31, 2010, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to Reporting Persons were satisfied on a timely basis.
Code of Business Conduct
We previously adopted a Code of Business Conduct that applied to all of our employees, including our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, and to the members of our Board of Directors. Given the nearly 100% turnover among our Board of Directors and management team and significant reduction in our staffing during the past two years, we have suspended implementation of our Code of Business Conduct while we consider changes to the code to reflect the needs of the organization and continue to focus on resolving more immediate issues affecting our cash flow and long-term viability.
Item 11. Executive Compensation
Our only executive officer is Adel Karas, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Mr. Karas joined Calypte as a nonemployee director in 2007 and took on these executive officer roles in 2008 after the persons who previously held those positions left Calypte. At present, Mr. Karas does not receive any compensation for serving in those roles. Mr. Karas holds an option that was granted to him in his capacity as a director during 2007. The following table sets forth information concerning Mr. Karas’s option as of December 31, 2019:
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
We have no compensation arrangements with our directors. Directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket travel expenses associated with their attendance at Board of Directors and committee meetings. Mr. Karas holds an outstanding option that was granted to him in his capacity as a director. See “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End” above.
Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
The following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of April 14, 2011 for (i) all persons known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) our chief executive officer and (iv) all current directors and executive officers as a group:
Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
Director Independence
The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Al Yousefi is the only independent director under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market as applied to members of the board of directors and of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee.
Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees accrued and paid by us for Odenberg Ullakko Muranishi & Co. LLP (“OUM”), our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
“Audit fees” include fees paid in 2010 and 2009 for the audits of our annual financial statements for 2009 and 2008; fees for the quarterly review of our financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2010 and 2009, as well as fees for consultation regarding accounting issues and their impact on or presentation in our financial statements; and fees for the review of registration statements and the issuance of related consents.
All of the audit and non-audit services described above were approved by our Board of Directors in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Calypte Biomedical Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Calypte Biomedical Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements audited by us present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Calypte Biomedical Corporation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, and management believes that the Company’s cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain its operations through 2011 without additional financing. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2010 and 2009
(1) The Company
Calypte Biomedical Corporation (the “Company”) develops, manufactures, and distributes in vitro diagnostic tests, primarily for the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection. We were incorporated in California in 1989 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996 at the time of our initial public offering. Since September 8, 2006, our common stock has traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “CBMC.” We are located in Portland, Oregon where we have a facility that combines both our research and development as well as administrative operations. We have a sales and marketing office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”), which is where our CEO is based. We have a Director of sales based in Milan, Italy.
Through late 2005, we manufactured and marketed urine-based HIV-1 diagnostic screening tests and urine and serum-based Western Blot supplemental (sometimes called “confirmatory”) tests for use in high-volume laboratories, which we refer to as our “Legacy Business.” In November 2005, we sold the Legacy Business to Maxim Biomedical, Inc. to concentrate on the development of our rapid test platform products.
Our current emphasis is commercializing our HIV-1/2 Rapid Tests, test products for the rapid detection of antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV Type 2 (“HIV-2”) in oral fluid using a lateral flow dipstick design (the “HIV-1/2 Rapid Tests”). Rapid tests provide diagnostic results in less than 20 minutes and are particularly suitable for point-of-care testing in both the professional sector, such as in developing countries that lack the medical infrastructure to support laboratory based testing, and, for the first time, in the over-the-counter or “OTC” market. We have completed field trials or product evaluations of our AwareTM HIV-1/2 OMT (oral fluid) rapid test covering an aggregate of over 8,000 samples in China, India, South Africa and elsewhere and believe that the results of these studies and evaluations have validated the test. In our studies, this test has averaged 99.7% accuracy. We have obtained regulatory approvals in a number of key countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Russia, India and China,.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, through an arrangement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), we introduced an HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA test (the “BED Incidence Test”) that detects HIV-1 infections that have occurred within approximately the prior 6 months and that can be used by public health agencies to identify those regions and the populations within them where HIV transmission is occurring most recently.
Until July 2010, we were the 51% owner of each of two joint ventures in China, Beijing Calypte Biomedical Technology Ltd. (“Beijing Calypte”) and Beijing Marr Bio-Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Marr”). In July 2010 we entered into a series of agreements providing for (i) the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital (the “Debt Agreement”) and (ii) the transfer of our interests in the two Chinese joint ventures, Beijing Marr and Beijing Calypte, to Kangplus (the “Equity Agreement”). Under the Debt Agreement, $6,393,353 in outstanding indebtedness was agreed to be converted to 152,341,741 shares of our common stock, and our remaining indebtedness to Marr, totaling $3,000,000 as of December 31, 2009, was cancelled. In consideration for such debt restructuring, we transferred our equity interests in Beijing Marr to Kangplus pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement and transferred certain related technology to Beijing Marr. We have also agreed to transfer our equity interests in Beijing Calypte to Marr or a designate of its choosing. The transactions contemplated by the Debt Agreement and the Equity Transfer Agreement are subject to Chinese government registration of the transfer of the equity interests. Under the debt agreement with SF Capital, $2,008,259 in outstanding indebtedness was converted to 47,815,698 shares of our common stock.
(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Calypte, Inc., and its 51% ownership interests in both Beijing Calypte and Beijing Marr. We have eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our consolidated Chinese joint ventures is the local currency, the Chinese Yuan Renminbi. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiary to U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the reporting period. We translate revenues and expenses at the average rates of exchange for the accounting period. We have reported the effect of translation gains and losses as our only component of other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of investments in money market accounts.

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Property and Equipment
Our property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate our buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and computer equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. . We generally depreciate our assets as follows:
Leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases are amortized or depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the equipment or improvement.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and intangible assets. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We compare an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset, or by the appropriate grouping of assets, to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we measure the loss based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate the fair value based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flow and fundamental analysis. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial assets and short-term liabilities, with the exception of the convertible notes and debentures, have carrying values which approximate their fair values for all periods presented. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate fair value because of their short-term nature and because such amounts are invested in accounts earning market rates of interest. The maturity amount of the convertible notes approximates fair value because of the relatively short period until the maturity of the notes. The face amount of the convertible notes is offset by discounts related to the unamortized portion of beneficial conversion and/or anti-dilution features, if any, embedded in the notes or discounts occurring as a result of modification of the notes. We record any related anti-dilution obligations and/or note derivative liabilities at their fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Revenue Recognition
We record revenues only upon the occurrence of all of the following conditions:
•
We have received a binding purchase order or similar commitment from the customer or distributor authorized by a representative empowered to commit the purchaser (evidence of a sale).
•
The purchase price has been fixed, based on the terms of the purchase order.
•
We have delivered the product from our contract manufacturing plant to a common carrier acceptable to the purchaser. Our customary shipping terms are FOB shipping point. Because of the need for controlled conditions during shipment, we suggest, but leave to the purchaser’s discretion, acquiring insurance for the value of the shipment. If the purchaser elects to insure the shipment, the insurance is at the purchaser’s expense.
•
We deem the collection of the amount invoiced probable. To eliminate the credit risk associated with international distributors with whom we have had little or no experience, we require prepayment of the order or a letter of credit before shipment.
Except in the event of verified product defect, we do not permit product returns. Our products must be maintained under rigidly controlled conditions that we cannot control after the product has been shipped to the customer.
We provide no price protection. Subject to the conditions noted above, we recognize revenue upon shipment of product.
Royalty Revenue
Royalty Revenue is recognized upon receipt of the semi-annual royalty data from the licensee, as designated in the royalty agreement, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for the financial reporting of income taxes. Under ASC 740, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. To date, we have no history of earnings. Therefore, our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”), as codified by ASC 740, on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance related to, among other things, classification, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and disclosure requirements. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we determined that we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing FIN 48 (see Note 12, Income Taxes).
Classification of Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liability and Equity
We account for financial instruments that we have issued and that have characteristics of both liability and equity in accordance with FASB ASC topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”) ASC 480 specifies that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments are to be recorded as liabilities unless the redemption is required to occur upon the liquidation or termination of the issuer. ASC 480 also specifies that a financial instrument that embodies a conditional obligation that an issuer may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares is to be classified as a liability if, at inception, the value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares. Should a financial instrument not be classified as a liability under the provisions of ASC 480, we further apply the criteria in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock, as codified by FASB ASC topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”), which enumerates additional criteria to determine the appropriate classification as liability or equity. We also evaluate the anti-dilution and/or beneficial conversion features that may be included in our financial instruments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as codified by ASC 815, which may classify the feature as an embedded derivative and require that the financial instrument be bifurcated and the feature accounted for separately. We evaluate each financial instrument on its own merits at inception or other prescribed measurement or valuation date and may engage the services of valuation experts and other professionals to assist in our determination of the appropriate classification.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”), as codified in FASB ASC topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 817”) effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method. Under this method, we apply the provisions of SFAS 123R to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. We recognized in our net loss for the periods after the date of adoption the unrecognized expense attributable to awards not yet vested at the January 1, 2006 date of adoption using the same valuation method (i.e. Black-Scholes option valuation model) and assumptions determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as disclosed on a pro-forma basis in our previous financial statements. During 2007, we recorded stock compensation expense attributable to unvested options granted prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R of $59,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, we recognize stock-based compensation, net of an estimated forfeiture rate which results in recognizing compensation expense for only those awards expected to vest, over the service period of the award.
We estimate the fair value of stock option grants made to employees and directors during and expect to estimate the fair value of future grants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Calculating stock-based compensation expense under the provisions of SFAS 123R requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price volatility, and pre-vesting option forfeitures. Because of significant restructurings of our operations and reductions in our workforce in the past which have resulted in the termination of a significant number of our employees prior to the vesting of their options, to date, we have generally estimated the expected life of options granted in the future based on the simplified method provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 for “plain vanilla” options. Where appropriate, we will consider separately for valuation purposes groups of employees or directors that have similar historical exercise behavior. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on its historical volatility over a period generally equivalent to the expected term of the grant. We estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and recognize expense for only those shares expected to vest. We have estimated our forfeiture rate based on our historical experience with stock-based awards that are granted and forfeited prior to vesting. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could also differ from what we have recorded in the current period. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As required under ASC 718, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, may periodically change the valuation assumptions used to value employee and director stock-based awards granted in future periods.
Net Income (Loss)Per Share
We compute basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented. The computation of diluted loss per common share is similar to the computation of basic net income (loss) per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of options and warrants, to the extent they are dilutive, using the treasury stock method. The weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Outstanding options and warrants to purchase 6,175,002 shares and 44,550,748 shares were excluded from the computation of net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as their effect is anti-dilutive. The computation of net income (loss) per share also excludes 19,894,292 shares issuable upon the conversion of 8% Convertible Notes, including 8% Convertible Notes issued in payment of interest, and, 7% Notes issued under the Marr Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2009 as their effect is also anti-dilutive.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. We have investment policies that limit investments to short-term, low-risk investments. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the fact that we sell our products primarily to established distributors or require prepayment for certain orders where the relationship between the parties is not well-established.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties
We purchase certain raw materials and components used in manufacturing our products from a number of suppliers, but we rely on single sources for certain other components. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these components. Any delay or interruption in the supply of these components could have a material adverse effect on us by significantly impairing our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities to meet commercial sales demand. Additionally, if our financial condition impairs our ability to pay for critical components on a timely basis or to make royalty payments as required under our license agreements, suppliers may delay or cease selling critical components to us or our rights to use license agreements could be jeopardized, both of which could also impair our ability to manufacture and/or market our products.
Comprehensive Loss
We report the effect of translation gains and losses related to our consolidated Chinese joint ventures as our only component of other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Deficit.
Segment and Geographic Information
SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information requires that we report segment information based on how our management internally evaluates the operating performance of our business units (segments). Our operations are currently confined to a single business segment, the development and sale of HIV diagnostics.

Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 62% and 74% of our revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010 approximately $111,300.21, or 43%, of our inventory and $0 of our property and equipment, net, was held in international locations.
Three customers accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue for 2010. Our South African distributor purchased both BED Incidence Tests and our AwareTM HIV-1/2 oral fluid rapid tests representing 29% of our 2010 revenue. Two U.S. customers accounted for 14% and 10% respectively of our 2010 BED Incidence Tests revenue. In 2009, our South African distributor purchased both BED Incidence Tests and our AwareTM HIV-1/2 oral fluid rapid tests representing 23% of our 2009 revenue. A customer in China’s BED Incidence Test purchases accounted for 16% of our 2009 revenue and New York’s BED Incidence Test purchases accounted for 10% of our revenue for 2009.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements Disclosures , which amends Subtopic 820-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements. More specifically, this update will require (a) an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers; and (b) information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be presented separately (i.e. present the activity on a gross basis rather than net) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). This update clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The adoption of this statement effective January 1, 2010 did not materially expand the Company's consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures.

These licenses provide us with access to the HIV-2 antigen, to certain lateral flow technologies and to certain HIV-1/2 peptides used in our rapid tests. We recorded the license amount for each license agreement as an intangible asset. We began amortizing these intangible assets in 2006, when we began commercial sales of the products employing the licensed technology or materials. We recognized amortization expense of $218,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

8% Secured Convertible Notes
On April 4, 2005, we concluded a private placement to five institutional investors of $8,000,000 of Secured 8% Convertible Notes originally due April 3, 2007 (the “Convertible Notes”) and subsequently extended to April 3, 2009. The Convertible Notes provide for quarterly interest to be paid in cash, or subject to certain conditions, by issuing additional Convertible Notes maturing on April 3, 2009 (the “Interest Notes”). From July 4, 2005 through April 3, 2009 we issued Interest Notes in an aggregate face amount of $1,962,000 in payment of quarterly interest.
As discussed in Note 3 in July 2010 we entered into a series of agreements providing for (i) the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital (the “Debt Agreement”) and (ii) the transfer of our interests in the two Chinese joint ventures, Beijing Marr and Beijing Calypte, to Kangplus (the “Equity Agreement”). Under the Debt Agreement, $6,393,353 in outstanding indebtedness was agreed to be converted to 152,341,741 shares of our common stock, and our remaining indebtedness to Marr, totaling $3,000,000 was cancelled. In consideration for such debt restructuring, we transferred our equity interests in Beijing Marr to Kangplus pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement and transferred certain related technology to Beijing Marr. We have also agreed to transfer our equity interests in Beijing Calypte to Marr or a designate of its choosing. The transactions contemplated by the Debt Agreement and the Equity Transfer Agreement are subject to Chinese government registration of the transfer of the equity interests. Under the debt agreement with SF Capital, $2,008,259 in outstanding indebtedness was converted to 47,815,698 shares of our common stock.
Notwithstanding this debt restructuring, our significant working capital deficit and limited cash resources place a high degree of doubt on our ability to continue our operations. In light of our existing operations and financial challenges, we are exploring strategic and financing options. Failure to obtain additional financing will likely cause us to seek bankruptcy protection.

(9) Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock
At the time of our original incorporation, we issued both common stock and $1,000,000 of mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock. We are required to redeem all shares of mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock within 60 days of any fiscal year-end in which we attain $3,000,000 in retained earnings, and funds are legally available. Based on losses accumulated through December 31, 2010, we must achieve approximately $191,000,000 in future earnings before any repayment is required. The mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock is nonvoting and holders of these shares are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of $1.20 per share per annum. Through June 30, 2003, we had charged cumulative preferred dividends totaling $1,636,000 to stockholders’ deficit to accrete for the mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock redemption value with a corresponding increase in the recorded amount of the mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock. Since that date, we have charged the preferred dividends to interest expense to accrete for the mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock redemption value. During each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we charged preferred dividends totaling $120,000 to interest expense with a corresponding increase in the recorded amount of the mandatorily redeemable Series A preferred stock.
In anticipation of using a portion of the proceeds from its Initial Public Offering to redeem the Series A preferred stock, we eliminated the Series A preferred stock from our articles of incorporation upon our reincorporation in Delaware in June 1996. However, we subsequently chose not to redeem the Series A preferred stock and as of December 31, 2010 it remains outstanding. The holders of such shares maintain the same rights as held before the reincorporation.

As a result of this exercise, Mr. Khidasheli was issued 10,000,833 shares of our common stock.

Equity Line with Fusion Capital
On January 16, 2008, we entered into an equity line transaction with Fusion Capital Fund II, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (“Fusion Capital”), pursuant to which we may sell up to $8.0 million of our common stock to Fusion Capital in amounts between $100,000 and $1.0 million, depending on certain conditions, from time to time over a 24-month period beginning February 8, 2008, the date on which the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared effective the registration statement related to the transaction. In January 2008, we issued 3,490,401 shares of our common stock to Fusion Capital as a commitment fee for entering into the equity line. In December 2007, we issued 250,000 shares of our common stock to Fusion Capital for reimbursement of due diligence expenses related to the equity line. We recorded the aggregate value of the commitment fee shares and due diligence fee shares issued to Fusion Capital, approximately $342,000, as a Deferred Offering Cost. We had planned to recognize this cost as an expense of selling our stock under the equity line in an amount equivalent to the proportional amount of each sale in relation to the total commitment amount. During 2008, we recognized $37,000 of such expense based on sales of our stock to Fusion Capital. Through December 31, 2008, we have sold an aggregate of 13,831,133 shares of our common stock to Fusion Capital at an average price of $0.0687 per share and have received proceeds of $950,000. The purchase price of the shares we sell to Fusion Capital is determined based upon the market price of our common stock, as defined, without any fixed discount. We cannot sell shares to Fusion Capital if the market price of our common stock is below $0.052 per share; and accordingly, we have been precluded from selling additional shares under this arrangement since May 2008. Based on the current market price of our common stock and our recent and expected future inability to sell stock to Fusion Capital under this arrangement prior to its expiration, we expensed the remaining unamortized balance of Deferred Offering Cost, $305,000, as a component of interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Under the terms of an investment banking agreement with Capstone Investments (“Capstone”), we are required to issue to Capstone as a fee for services the number of shares equal to 4% of the number of shares sold to Fusion Capital. Through December 31, 2008, we have issued an aggregate of 553,246 unregistered shares of our common stock valued at $30,000 on the date of issuance to Capstone under this agreement.

2009-11 Private Placements
In September 2009 and March 2010, we entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with Carolina Lupascu pursuant to which Ms. Lupascu purchased 7,000,000 shares and 12,933,333 shares, respectively, of our common stock (the “Shares”) at a purchase price of $0.03 per share, for a total purchase price of $210,000, and $388,000, respectively, which Ms. Lupascu had advanced to us in several installments during 2009. The Shares were issued pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. Each of the Subscription Agreements contains customary representations and warranties by Ms. Lupascu regarding her status as a non-U.S. person, her investment intent and restrictions on transfer. Ms. Lupascu was granted certain piggy-back registration rights which require us to use our best efforts to register all or a portion of the Shares on the next registration statement we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. We used the proceeds of the private placements for general working capital purposes.
During 2010, Ms. Lupascu made several advances totaling $180,000 in anticipation of entering into a future subscription agreement. We used the proceeds of these investments for general working capital purposes. In January 2011, we entered into a subscription agreement with Ms. Lupascu having substantially the same terms and conditions as the Subscription Agreements, pursuant to which Ms. Lupascu purchased 6,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $0.03. These shares were issued in reliance upon Regulation S.
Also during 2010, Mr. Khidasheli made several advances totaling $500,000 in anticipation of entering into a future subscription agreement.

(11) Share Based Payments
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”) Share-Based Payment, as codified in FASB ASC topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), effective January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation, including stock options, in net income (loss). We recognize the stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally is the same as the vesting period of the grant. All of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument. We generally issue stock option grants to employees with an exercise price equal to the market price at the grant date.
We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R are applied to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. We recognized in our net loss the unrecognized expense attributable to awards not yet vested at our January 1, 2006 date of adoption in the periods after the date of adoption using the same valuation method (i.e. Black-Scholes) and assumptions determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as disclosed on a pro-forma basis in our previous filings.
We value option grants to non-employees at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Option grants that do not include sufficient disincentive for non-performance are accounted for in accordance with EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with, Selling Goods and Services and EITF 00-18, Accounting Recognition for Certain Transactions involving Equity Instruments Granted to Other Than Employees. In such instances, the deferred compensation is amortized over the term of the agreement on a straight-line basis. Until the awards are fully vested or a measurement date is achieved, we record an adjustment to deferred compensation and consultant expense to reflect the impact of the fair value, as remeasured at quarter-end, of the options based on changes to our stock price.
We did not grant any options to employees or members of our Board of Directors during 2010. Under the provisions of ASC 718, we have recorded approximately ($32,000) of stock based employee compensation expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 attributable to stock option forfeitures, offset by employee options granted during the second quarter of 2008 and to options granted to non-employee members of our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007. We have assumed an annual pre-vesting forfeiture rate of 7.75% in determining our stock compensation expense. In determining the inputs to the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we have assumed a dividend yield of zero since we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to do so. We estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period generally commensurate with the expected life of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate based on the quoted U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for a security having a comparable term at the time of the grant. To date, we have calculated the expected term of option grants using the simplified method prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 for “plain vanilla” options. We have historically granted options having a ten year contractual term to our employees and directors.
The following table presents a summary of option activity for all of our stock option plans from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under all of our option plans at December 31, 2010.
There was no intrinsic value associated with any of our outstanding options at December 31, 2010, as the exercise prices for all outstanding or exercisable options exceeded the $0.005 per share quoted market price of our common stock at that date.
We did not record any income tax benefits for stock-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009, as we have cumulative operating losses and have established full valuation allowances for our income tax benefits.
(12) Section 401(k) Plan
Effective January 1, 1995, we adopted a Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) covering our full-time employees located in the United States. The 401(k) Plan was intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees could elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit and to have the amount of such reduction contributed to the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan permitted us to make contributions which become vested to our employees over terms as described in the plan, but we made no such contributions in either 2010 or 2009. We terminated the 401(k) Plan effective June 7, 2010 and have disbursed the funds to the plan participants on record.

(13) Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is based upon our loss before provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as follows (in thousands):
For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% to domestic pretax losses as a result of the following:
The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax asset is presented below:
The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2010 was a decrease of $5,363,000 and in 2009 was a decrease of 2,899,000. Because there is uncertainty regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, a 100% valuation allowance has been established. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), we have excluded certain tax benefits resulting from employee stock option exercises from our deferred tax asset at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In the future, if and when such tax benefits are ultimately realized, the amount of excess tax benefits will be credited to additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit.
As of December 31, 2010, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $79 million and federal research and development credit carryforwards of $482,000, as it expired in 2010. We also have state net operating loss carryforwards of $5.8 million and state research and development credit carryforwards of $0 as of December 31, 2010. The state net operating loss carryforwards expired in 2010 and the state research and development credits will carryforward indefinitely.

December 31, 2010 and 2009
Federal and state laws limit the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. We conducted a preliminary analysis of our stock ownership changes under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 from our inception through December 31, 2007 and have reported our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and research credit carryforwards after recognizing change of control limitations that may have occurred in 2003 and 2004. This limitation resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. The Company has not updated its Section 382 analysis to assess whether any additional ownership changes have occurred due to costs associated with such analysis. If the Company has experienced any additional changes of control, utilization of its NOL or tax credit carryforwards would be subject to annual limitations under Section 382. Such additional annual limitations could result in the expiration of our reported net operating loss and credit carryforwards available as of December 31, 2010 before their utilization.
We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007 (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Upon adoption of FIN 48, we determined that we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing FIN 48.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years 1993 through 2009 due to net operating losses that are being carried forward for tax purposes.
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We had no accrual for interest or penalties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and have not recognized interest or penalties in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
(14) Related Party Transactions
Until July 2010, we were the 51% owner of each of two joint ventures in China, Beijing Calypte Biomedical Technology Ltd. (“Beijing Calypte”) and Beijing Marr Bio-Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Marr”). In July 2010 we entered into a series of agreements providing for (i) the restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness to Marr and SF Capital (the “Debt Agreement”) and (ii) the transfer of our interests in the two Chinese joint ventures, Beijing Marr and Beijing Calypte, to Kangplus (the “Equity Agreement”). Under the Debt Agreement, $6,393,353 in outstanding indebtedness was agreed to be converted to 152,341,741 shares of our common stock, and our remaining indebtedness to Marr, totaling $3,000,000, was cancelled. As of December 31, 2010, the common stock had not yet been issued and we have recorded a liability to related party on our balance sheet for $914,000. In consideration for such debt restructuring, we transferred our equity interests in Beijing Marr to Kangplus pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement and transferred certain related technology to Beijing Marr. We have also agreed to transfer our equity interests in Beijing Calypte to Marr or a designate of its choosing. The transactions contemplated by the Debt Agreement and the Equity Transfer Agreement are subject to Chinese government registration of the transfer of the equity interests. Under the debt agreement with SF Capital, $2,008,259 in outstanding indebtedness was converted to 47,815,698 shares of our common stock.
In the agreement with Beijing Marr Bio-Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., we agreed to continue to buy raw materials for them and provide them with technical support. We purchased raw materials for Beijing Marr three times in 2010, totaling $33,770, for which we were reimbursed. In 2011 we sent one person to Beijing Marr to provide technical support for three weeks. During 2011, we recognized $3432 in revenue related to this technical support.
During 2010, two investors advanced a total of $680,000 to the Company. Through April 2011, these investors have further advanced us $142,000. These advances are intended for future subscription agreements.
On or around May 15, 2009, we amended the warrant originally issued to David Khidasheli on March 27, 2007, and amended on June 11, 2008, to lower the exercise price from $0.05 per share to $0.03, as an inducement to Mr. Khidasheli to treat the $300,025 he advanced to us in the first quarter of 2009 as an exercise of the warrant. As a result of this exercise, Mr. Khidasheli was issued 10,000,833 shares of our common stock. We have recognized a deemed dividend of $1,000 in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations attributable to the incremental fair value resulting from reducing the exercise price and extending the term of these warrants, calculated as of the date of the modification using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:

(15) Commitments and Contingencies
On August 31, 2009 we filed a complaint against Roger Gale, a former director and officer of Calypte, Ron Mink, a former Chief Scientific Officer of Calypte, three other former employees, and Sedia Bioscience Corporation, a company formed in 2009 with which these former employees are believed to be associated (collectively, the “Defendants”), in the Circuit Court of the County of Multnomah in Portland, Oregon. In this matter, we are seeking (i) to enjoin Defendants from using or disclosing any of our trade secrets related to diagnostic and population incidence testing, (ii) to recover property belonging to us, and (iii) monetary damages. On March 10, 2010 we entered into a settlement agreement with Sedia and the Defendants,the terms of which are confidential but are not material to the Company or its investors.
Lease
We lease an office facility with a remaining term that extends to May 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2010, we have paid 13 months of rent. Rent expense was $84,000 for 2010.
Future annual minimum payments under the lease are as follows:
(16) Subsequent Events
Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we have received an aggregate of $142,000 in advances from an existing investor in anticipation of entering into a subscription agreement. We are using the proceeds of these investments for general working capital purposes.
During 2010, two investors advanced the Company a total of $680,000 in anticipation of future subscription agreements. In 2011, these advances were converted to stock purchases upon completion of pending subscription agreements.
In November, 2010, Calypte was awarded a grant of $244,479 under U.S. Government's Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project (QTDP) program. The QTDP grant is provided under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Of this award, we received $77,331 in December 2010 and the remaining $171,148 in February 2011.
We have evaluated all other subsequent events through the date of this filing and determined there are no other material recognized or unrecognized subsequent events.
