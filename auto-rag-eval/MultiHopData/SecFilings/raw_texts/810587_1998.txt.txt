Item 2. Properties.
The Partnership is a landlord only and does not participate in the operations of any of the properties discussed herein. All lease payments due the Partnership are current. All properties are 100% occupied (with the exception of the Buffalo, Palm Bay and Logansport properties) and were paid for in cash, without any financing. The General Partners believe that the Partnership's properties are adequately insured.
The following information is presented for the only property whose cost basis exceeds 10% of the gross proceeds of the Offering.
On July 21, 1989, the Partnership and Brauvin High Yield Fund L.P. II ("BHYF II"), an affiliated public real estate limited partnership, formed a joint venture, Brauvin Funds Joint Venture ("Funds JV"), to purchase a Scandinavian Health Spa (the "Health Spa") in Glendale, Arizona from an unaffiliated developer for $5,250,000, plus closing costs. The Health Spa was constructed in 1988. The Health Spa is subject to a triple-net lease with the lessee, Scandinavian U.S. Swim & Fitness, Inc., which is responsible for paying all taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs. The lease terminates in 2009. The rent is payable in equal monthly installments and was increased by 11.5% on February 1, 1994 and will increase by 11.5% every five years thereafter. The lease is guaranteed by Bally's Health and Tennis Corporation whose financial statements reflected a net worth of approximately $275 million at the time of acquisition. On this basis, the General Partners determined that no rent insurance would be required by the Partnership.
The Partnership contributed $2,585,608 (49%) to Funds JV and BHYF II contributed $2,691,143 (51%). Taxable income and distributable cash flow have been and will continue to be allocated according to the venturers' respective capital contributions.

Risks of Ownership
The possibility exists that the tenants of the Partnership's properties may be unable to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the terms of their leases, including making base rent or percentage rent payments to the Partnership. Such a default by the tenants or a premature termination of any one of the leases could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Partnership. Furthermore, the Partnership may be unable to successfully locate a substitute tenant due to the fact that these buildings have been designed or built primarily to house a specific operation. Thus, the properties may not be readily marketable to a new tenant without substantial capital improvements or remodeling. Such improvements may require expenditure of Partnership funds otherwise available for distribution. In addition, because in excess of 40% of the Partnership's cash available for investment has been invested in properties operated as Ponderosa family restaurants and in excess of 38% of the Partnership's rental income is from properties operated as Taco Bells restaurants, the Partnership is subject to some risk of loss should adverse events affect Ponderosa or Taco Bell restaurants and in turn adversely affect the lessees' ability to pay rent to the Partnership.
