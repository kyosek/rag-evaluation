Item 2. Properties
Turkey
General. As of March 1, 2012, we held interests in 57 onshore exploration licenses and nine onshore production leases covering a total of approximately 5.3 million gross acres (approximately 4.3 million net acres) in Turkey. We acquired our interests in Turkey through acquisitions, as well as through farm-in agreements with existing third-party license holders and through applications submitted to the Turkish General Directorate for Petroleum Affairs (the “GDPA”), the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey.
The following is a map showing our interests in Turkey:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2011, we had total net proved reserves of 11,208 Mbbl of oil and 12,846 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 4,801 Mbbl of oil and 12,622 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 11,655 Mbbl of oil and 105,174 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey.
Equipment. As of March 1, 2012, we leased equipment yards in Muratli, Diyarbakir and Tekirdag and owned equipment yards at Selmo, Tekirdag and Edirne. As of March 1, 2012, we owned eleven drilling rigs and five workover and completion rigs. We expect to sell these drilling rigs along with our oilfield services business.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and natural gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. Royalties are at 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. Our revenue from the Selmo oil field is subject to an additional 10% royalty, which is offset by the amount of exploration expense that TEMI and DMLP, the owners of our interest in the Selmo oil field, incur in Turkey. If those exploration expenses do not equal or exceed the amount of this additional 10% royalty, we would owe the difference. The licenses have a four-year term but after the third year, a payment in the form of a bond must be made to extend the license if no new well has been drilled prior to that date. The GDPA awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA.
A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for petroleum. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments
and subscribing to additional work commitments. A final three-year term may be granted as an appraisal period for any oil or natural gas discovery registered in the previous terms. No single company may own more than eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the hectares under the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder applies to convert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares, to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years. Annual rentals are due based on the hectares comprising the lease.

As of March 1, 2012, there were 57 producing wells on the Selmo production lease. For 2011, our net production of oil in the Selmo field was approximately 838,615 Bbls of oil, at an average rate of approximately 2,298 Bbls per day. We plan to drill approximately 15 wells on the Selmo production lease during 2012. We are the operator of Production Lease 829, which expires in June 2015. We plan to submit an application to extend the expiration date of Production Lease 829 to June 2025.
Arpatepe (Production Lease 3118-5003 and License 5025). We own a 50% working interest in Production Lease 3118-5003 and License 5025, which cover approximately 11,200 and 84,600 gross acres, respectively. For 2011, our net production of oil from the Arpatepe field was approximately 49,994 Bbls of oil, at an average rate of approximately 137 Bbls per day. As of March 1, 2012, we had three producing wells on the Arpatepe production lease, and we plan to drill approximately three wells there during 2012. Aladdin Middle East, Ltd. (“Aladdin”) is the operator of Production Lease 3118-5003 and License 5025, which expire in November 2028 and February 2016, respectively.
Bakuk and Idil (Licenses 4069 and 4642). We own a 50% working interest in Licenses 4069 and 4642. The licenses cover an aggregate of approximately 219,000 gross acres on the Turkish border with Syria. We have completed construction of a 23-kilometer, 6-inch pipeline from the Bakuk-101 exploration well to an existing pipeline to the south and began selling limited quantities of natural gas in the second quarter of 2011. TPAO completed a tie-in from our pipeline to a nearby power plant, and we expect natural gas sales to the power plant to begin in 2012. We plan to drill approximately three wells on License 4069 and one well on License 4642 during 2012. Tiway Turkey, Ltd. (“Tiway”) is the operator of License 4069, which expires in September 2013. Tiway has applied for a production lease on License 4069, and if a production lease is granted, we and Tiway plan to apply for an exploration license covering the remaining original acreage in License 4069. We are the operator of License 4642, which expires in October 2014.
Molla (Licenses 4174 and 4845). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4174 and 4845, which cover an aggregate of approximately 50,000 acres adjacent to the northern border of our former License 3118 (now Production Lease 3118-5003). Our primary target is an underexplored Paleozoic play at a depth of approximately 9,800 feet. In 2011, we completed the Goksu-1 well as a new field discovery in the Mardin formation. In December 2011, we drilled the successful Goksu-2 appraisal well, and we plan to drill the Goksu-3 well on License 4845 in the second quarter of 2012. We believe this well will be the first horizontal well to test the fractured Mardin carbonate formations found in this region. We are the operator of Licenses 4174 and 4845, which expire in June 2012 and March 2014, respectively. We have applied for a two-year extension of the term of License 4174. We have also applied for an approximately 62,000 acre license immediately offsetting these licenses.
Central Basins. Our exploration licenses in central Turkey cover largely unexplored tertiary basins. We are currently seeking partners for these exploration licenses. Through farm-outs, we expect to reduce our exploration risk and accelerate the exploration and development activities on the farmed out properties. We intend to remain as operator of the properties that we farm-out. The following is a map showing our interests in central Turkey:
Adana/Yuksekkoy (Licenses 4350 and 4842). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4350 and 4842, which cover an aggregate of approximately 242,000 acres in the Adana area of southern Turkey. We plan to drill one exploratory well on License 4350 in 2012. We are the operator of Licenses 4350 and 4842, which expire in March 2014 and June 2015, respectively.
Malatya (Licenses 4659 and 4660). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4659 and 4660, which cover an aggregate of approximately 228,000 acres in the Malatya area of south-central Turkey. We paid a third party who will be a 10% working interest owner in the Malatya licenses cash consideration and agreed that the party would back-in for its 10% working interest after payout of the first well to be drilled on the Malatya licenses. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We are the operator of Licenses 4659 and 4660, which expire in January 2014.
Tuz Golu South (Licenses 4717, 4718, 4719, 4720, 4721 and 4722). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4717, 4718, 4719, 4720, 4721 and 4722, which cover an aggregate of approximately 733,000 acres in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in December 2014.
Sivas Basin (Licenses 4729, 4730, 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, 4735, 4736, 4737, 4738, 4739, 4740 and 4741).

We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in December 2014.
Gurun (License 4325). We own a 90% working interest in License 4325, which covers approximately 122,000 gross acres in central Turkey. In April 2009, we farmed-in for a 90% interest in License 4325 for cash consideration and the obligation to carry a 10% interest in the first well drilled. We plan to drill one well on License 4325 in 2012. We are the operator of License 4325, which expires in February 2014.
Gaziantep (Licenses 4607, 4648, 4649 and 4656). We own a 62.5% working interest in Licenses 4607, 4648, 4649 and 4656 (subject to a farm-in obligation of TEMI to earn a 50% working interest, and further subject to a 0.625% overriding royalty interest), which cover an aggregate of approximately 488,000 gross acres near the Turkish border with Syria. We are the operator of these licenses, which expire in October 2013, except for License 4607, which expires in August 2013.
Bulgaria
General. As of March 1, 2012, we held interests in two onshore exploration permits in Bulgaria. We acquired all of our Bulgarian interests through the purchase of Direct Bulgaria in February 2011. In January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted legislation that bans the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in Bulgaria. As long as this legislation remains in effect, our exploration, development and production activities in Bulgaria will be significantly constrained. The following is a map showing our interests in Bulgaria and Romania:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2011, we had total net proved reserves of 378 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 46 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 53 Mmcf of natural gas in Bulgaria.
Commercial Terms. Bulgaria’s petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties and income tax.
The royalty ranges from 2.5% to 30%, based on an “R factor” which is particular to each production concession agreement but is typically calculated by dividing the total cumulative revenues from a production concession by the total cumulative costs incurred for that production concession.
The production concession holder pays Bulgarian corporate income tax, which is assessed at a rate of 10%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Bulgaria are subject to a dividend withholding tax between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary to conduct petroleum operations. There is also a 19% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while natural gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Bulgaria for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in two stages: exploration permit and then production concession.
Under an exploration permit, the government grants exploration rights for a term of up to five years to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, including drilling. The recipient of an exploration permit commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. The area covered by an onshore exploration permit may be as large as 5,000 square kilometers. The exploration permit may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms, subject to fulfillment of minimum work programs, and may be extended for an additional one-year term in order to appraise potential geologic discoveries. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable, subject to government approval. The permit holder is required to pay an annual area fee equal to 30 Bulgarian Leva (approximately $21 at March 1, 2012) per square kilometer, or 45 Bulgarian Leva (approximately $31 at March 1, 2012) per square kilometer in the event the permit term is extended.
Upon the registration of a commercial discovery, an exploration permit holder may apply for a production concession. The production concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The duration of a production concession is 35 years and may be extended by a further 15 years subject to the terms and conditions of the production concession agreement. Interests under a production concession are transferable, subject to government approval. No bonus is paid to the government by the company upon conversion to a production concession.
Koynare and Stefenetz. We have submitted an application for a production concession covering approximately 160,000 acres over the northern portion of our former A-Lovech exploration permit, which expired in November 2011. The Koynare Concession Area contains the Deventci-R1 well, where we discovered a reservoir in the Jurassic-aged Orzirovo formation at a depth of approximately 13,800 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. As of March 1, 2012, the well was producing approximately 250 Mcf/d of natural gas on a limited test basis, which is sold to a compressed natural gas facility adjacent to the Deventci-R1 well. In November 2011, we commenced drilling an appraisal well, the Deventci-R2, on the Koynare Concession Area.
We have also submitted an application for a production concession covering approximately 395,000 acres over the southern portion of our former A-Lovech exploration permit. The Stefenetz Concession Area is estimated to contain over 300,000 prospective acres for Etropole shale at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. In September 2011, we entered into an agreement with LNG pursuant to which LNG funded the drilling of an exploration well on the Stefenetz Concession Area to core and test the Etropole shale formation. This well, the Peshtene-R11, reached total depth in late November 2011. We collected more than 900 feet of core, which is currently under evaluation. If the well is successful and we obtain a production concession over the Stefenetz Concession Area, LNG would fund up to an additional $12.5 million in exchange for a 50% working interest in the production concession.
In January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted legislation that bans fracture stimulation in the Republic of Bulgaria. The legislation also restricts the injection of fluids into underground formations at pressures greater than approximately 300 pounds per square inch. As a result, we have temporarily suspended drilling and completion operations for the Deventci-R2 and Peshtene-R11 wells. Although we expect the Bulgarian government to clarify the legislation to allow for conventional drilling and to institute a set of procedures regulating the fracture stimulation of wells, we cannot be certain when or if this will occur. In the meantime, we and LNG are evaluating the core data and developing a conventional completion program for the Peshtene-R11 well.
Aglen. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 1% overriding royalty interest, in the Aglen exploration permit, which covers approximately 1,700 acres within the boundaries of the former A-Lovech exploration permit and lies within the boundary of the Stefenetz Concession Area. The Aglen permit contains a prospective deep natural gas field that produced approximately 9.0 Bcf of natural gas before being abandoned in the late 1990s. We are the operator of the Aglen permit, which expires in April 2012. Due to the fracture stimulation ban, we have applied for a force majeure extension of this permit.
Romania
General. As of March 1, 2012, we owned an interest in one onshore production license in Romania, which was acquired through a farm-in agreement with Sterling in June 2009. As of December 31, 2011, there were no reserves associated with our Romanian properties. Please see “-Bulgaria-General” for the map showing our interest in Romania.
Commercial Terms. Romania’s petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties, excise tax and income tax. Two forms of royalty are payable as:
•
a percentage of the value of gross production on a field basis, such percentage being fixed on a sliding scale depending on production levels. The production royalty rate varies between 3.5% to 13.5% for oil and natural gas production; and
•
a fixed percentage of the gross income obtained from the transportation and transit of petroleum through the national pipeline system and from petroleum operations carried out through oil terminals belonging to the state. The royalty rate is currently fixed at 10%.
The license holder pays Romanian corporate income tax, but enjoys a one-year income tax holiday from the first day of production. Corporate income tax is assessed at a rate of 16%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes. Excise duty is payable on oil and natural gas at the rate of 4 Euro per ton of oil and between 0.32 Euro and 2.6 Euro per gigajoule of natural gas, depending on the end use of the natural gas. Excise tax is not payable on oil or natural gas delivered as royalty to the Romanian government or on quantities directly exported. Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Romania are subject to a dividend withholding tax at between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary for the conduct of petroleum operations. There is also a 24% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while natural gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The Ministry of Industry and Resources of Romania has responsibility for petroleum policy and strategy. The National Agency for Mineral Resources (“NAMR”) was set up in 1993 to administer and regulate petroleum operations. When licenses are to be made available, NAMR publishes a list of available blocks for concession in the Official Gazette. Foreign and Romanian companies must register their interest by a specified date and must submit applications by an application deadline. Applicants are required to prove their financial capacity, technical expertise and other requirements as required by NAMR. The licensing rounds are competitive and the winning bid is based on a scoring system.
NAMR negotiates the terms of agreements granting the licenses with the winning licensee and the license agreement is then submitted to the Romanian government for its approval. The date of government approval is the effective date of the license. Blocks which fail to attract a prescribed level of bids are re-offered in a subsequent licensing round. NAMR may issue a prospecting permit or a petroleum concession. A prospecting permit is for the conduct of geological mapping, magnetometry, gravimetry, seismology, geochemistry, remote sensing and drilling of wildcat wells in order to determine the general geological conditions favoring petroleum accumulations. A petroleum concession provides exclusive rights to conduct petroleum exploration and production under a petroleum agreement.
Sud Craiova. We own a 50% working interest in Sud Craiova Block E III-7, which covers approximately 1.0 million gross acres in western Romania. We and Sterling plan to shoot a 200 kilometer 2D seismic survey on the Sud Craiova license in 2012. Sterling is the operator of the Sud Craiova license, which expires in December 2013.
Current Operations
During 2011, we continued to develop our Selmo oil field and our Thrace Basin natural gas properties. In addition, we continued the process of integrating the properties, equipment and personnel of Amity, Petrogas, Direct Bulgaria and TBNG into our operations. For additional information on our current operations, see “Item 1. Business-Current Operations.”
Planned Operations
We continue to actively explore and develop our existing oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and evaluate opportunities for further activities in Bulgaria and Romania. For more information on our planned 2012 operations, see “Item 1. Business-Planned Operations.”
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Substantially all of our net proved, probable and possible reserves are located in Turkey. The following table summarizes our net proved, probable and possible reserves at December 31, 2011 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, PV-10 and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2011:
(1) The PV-10 value of the estimated future net revenue is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure:
Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
At December 31, 2011, our estimated proved reserves were 13,419 Mboe, a decrease of 19.5% compared to 16,673 Mboe at December 31, 2010. During 2011, we added estimated proved reserves of 111 Mboe through extensions and discoveries driven by our 2011 drilling activity in Turkey. In addition, we added estimated proved reserves of 938 Mboe through the acquisition of TBNG. These increases were offset by production volumes of approximately 1,667 Mboe and performance revisions in existing producing wells.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2011, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 6,293 Mboe, a decrease of 24.4% compared to 8,326 Mboe at December 31, 2010. This decrease in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to 966 Mboe of proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves in Selmo and a reduction of proved undeveloped reserves in Alpullu and Edirne of 954 Mboe due to proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves and performance revisions in existing producing wells. The 966 Mboe of proved undeveloped reserves that were converted to proved developed reserves was due to drilling and completing eight proved undeveloped well locations. During 2011, we incurred $13.1 million in capital expenditures to drill and complete these eight proved undeveloped wells. At December 31, 2011, no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves. We intend to convert the proved undeveloped reserves disclosed as of December 31, 2011 to proved developed reserves within five years of the date they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves.
Probable Reserves
Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
At December 31, 2011, our estimated probable reserves were 6,912 Mboe, a decrease of 41.1% compared to 11,726 Mboe at December 31, 2010. This decrease in probable reserves was primarily attributable to 7,985 Mboe of probable reserves that were removed due to poor drilling results, performance revisions in existing wells and changes in development plans. The decrease in probable reserves was partially offset by an increase in probable reserves during 2011 of 3,171 Mboe that was primarily attributable to the acquisition of TBNG in June 2011 and the addition of probable reserves in the Arpatepe field.
Possible Reserves
Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
At December 31, 2011, our estimated possible reserves were 29,194 Mboe, a decrease of 30.2% compared to 41,824 Mboe at December 31, 2010. This decrease in possible reserves was primarily attributable to 15,769 Mboe of possible reserves that were removed due to poor drilling results, performance revisions in existing wells and changes in development plans. The decrease in possible reserves was partially offset by an increase in possible reserves during 2011 of 3,139 Mboe that was primarily attributable to the acquisition of TBNG in June 2011 and an increase in possible reserves in the Pancarkoy prospect.
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain an outside independent engineering firm to prepare estimates of our proved, probable and possible reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Our internal audit department has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2011. Senior management reviews and approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of three outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves, and we are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves, using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves presented as of December 31, 2011 have been prepared by DeGolyer
and MacNaughton, our external engineers. The technical person at DeGolyer and MacNaughton that is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. He has over 29 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations, is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with DeGolyer and MacNaughton to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them for the preparation of their reserves estimates. Our internal senior reservoir engineer is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve estimation process. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Middle East Technical University and a Masters Degree in Petroleum Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. He has over 25 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, including experience in production and reservoir engineering, and is a member of multiple professional organizations.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 22-Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves and standardized measure information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved, probable and possible reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a detailed review of our Selmo, Arpatepe, Bakuk, Molla and Thrace Basin properties in Turkey and our property in Bulgaria. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that their estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
