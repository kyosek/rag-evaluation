Location and Access
The Matoush project is located in the Otish Mountains in northern Québec, about 300 kilometres north of Chibougamau, and consists of the Matoush, Matoush Extension and Eclat properties. The Matoush project presently covers 313 claims for a total area of 16,619 hectares. The project is accessible by air, and in winter by the Eastmain winter road, which runs about seven kilometres to the west of the property. Please see Figure 2 supra.
Mining Claims
The property consists of 25 claims covering an area of 1,330 hectares.
A letter of intent dated May 12, 2005 provided for the Company to earn a 51% interest from Ditem Explorations Inc. (“Ditem”), which owned a 100% interest, in consideration of payments totalling $125,000 over two years, including $5,000 on signature of the agreement; $750,000 in exploration work over three years, including $200,000 the first year; and the issuance of 600,000 common shares of the Company over two years. The Beaver Lake Area project, which lies approximately 20 kilometres to the west, was also covered by this agreement.

The claims in the Beaver Lake area project have not been renewed by the Company.
Uranium Potential
The Otish Mountain area is well known for its uranium potential, particularly due to exploration conducted by Uranerz Mining and Cogema in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mining giant Cameco Corporation, the largest public uranium producer in the world, holds a large number of claims immediately to the south of the Company’s Matoush and Eclat properties, and has conducted a range of exploration activities in recent years, primarily geophysics..
The results of exploration conducted by Uranerz Exploration and Mining in the early 1980s before uranium prices tumbled, as well as those obtained by the Company in 2006 and 2007, indicate that the Matoush property has a very good potential.
Uranerz only explored a 900-metre section of the Matoush structure, which had been traced over 3,900 metres on this property. This exploration work included holes drilled at a spacing of about 200 metres. Hole AM-15, which returned a 16-metre intersection grading 0.95% U3O8 (19 lbs/ton), served as the Company’s point of departure for exploration of the property.
The holes drilled on the Matoush property indicate that the uranium mineralization is closely linked to the fuschite and tourmaline alteration on both sides of a gabbro dike in the sediments. The alteration envelope associated with the Matoush structure is symmetrical, with an average thickness of 40 metres. Typically, adjacent to and moving outward from the dike is first a tourmaline zone, then a chlorite-fuschite-muscovite zone and a limonite-hematite zone.
Exploration Work
The Company was very active in exploration on the Matoush property in 2006, with various activities carried out from February 2006 on, mainly drilling. The results were encouraging. A helicopter-borne radiometry, magnetic and electromagnetic survey covering the entire Matoush project over about 1,410 line-kilometres was also done, along with prospecting.
The holes drilled on the Matoush property served to confirm the presence of the ACF (Active Channel Facies), favourable to the deposition of uranium mineralization. This observation, based on the technical report for the last drilling program by Uranerz in 1984, as well as in-depth reading of each of the holes drilled by the Company in 2006, proved to be a valuable guide for exploration, and particularly for the identification of future drill targets.
The Matoush mineralized showing lies in the Indicator Formation, in the the Otish Mountain Paleoproterozoic sedimentary basin. Locally, the Indicator Formation is subdivided into repetitive sequences of two main facies. The first, the Active Channel Facies, or ACF, is composed of relatively coarse, immature arkosic-to-sub-arkosic sandstone. The second, the Channel Bar Facies, or CBF, consists of relatively fine, mature arkosic sandstone, finely laminated with some cross-lamination. Three pairs of ACF-CBF have been identified in holes drilled by the Company in 2006 and the old Uranerz drill holes.
- 7 -
In 2006, three main ACF and two intercalated CBF have been identified from surface. The first ACF extends from surface to -40 metres, the second from -200 to -260 metres and the third from -360 to -460 metres, remaining open at depth as the deepest hole drilled by the Company was to -460 metres.
From March 22 to December 17, 2006, 38 holes totalling 13,668 metres were drilled by one drill operated by Major Drilling International Ltd of Val d’Or. Drilling was ongoing, except for during the thaw period from April 17 to June 16.
With the exception of one hole (MT-06-17) that targeted the upper part of the ACF below -400 metres and another drilled in the upper facies near surface (MT-06-24), the 2006 holes were drilled in the AM-15 zone and its northern extension. The Matoush structure, which has been identified over a distance of eight kilometres, was tested by drilling over 720 metres in 2006, and remains open in both directions. The Company received chemical analysis results in 2006 from Saskatoon Research Centre (SRC) laboratories for 25 of the 38 holes drilled during the year and for the remaining 13 holes on February 16, 2007. The results were released on February 20, 2007.
The results obtained on the AM-15 zone, confirmed the high-grade potential over notable widths.
The results obtained included the following holes.
MT-06-04
1.01% U3O8
14.1 m. - 20.2 lb/ton
MT-06-05
1.54% U3O8
9.5 m. - 30.8 lb/ton
MT-06-09
1.68% U3O8
5.6 m. - 33.6 lb/ton
MT-06-10
1.12% U3O8
10.8 m. - 22.4 lb/ton
MT-06-30
2.10% U3O8
12.4 m. - 42.0 lb/ton
MT-06-35
2.13% U3O8
15.2 m. - 42.6 lb/ton
These results compare favourably to Hole AM-15 drilled by Uranerz in the early 1980s (0.95% U3O8 over 16 metres). The first holes drilled by the Company in March 2006, particularly Hole MT-06-02, which was a duplicate of Hole AM-15, returned 0.74% U3O8 over 18.2 metres. Note that the section of 0.95% U3O8 over 16 metres includes an high grade of 20.4% U3O8 over 0.5 metre. The first 29 holes drilled by the Company did not intersect high grades. However, Hole MT-06-30 with a pierce point 50 metres north of Hole AM-15 in the upper ACF and Hole MT-06-35 with a pierce point in the lower ACF, 42 metres from Hole MT-06-30 and 25 metres from Hole AM-15, confirmed the existence of high grades, with 16.6% U3O8 over 0.3 metre for MT-06-30 and 11.16% U3O8 over 0.9 metre for MT-06-35. Intersections for holes MT-06-30 (2.10 % U3O8 over 12.4 metres) and MT-06-35 (2.13% U3O8 over 15.2 metres) proved to be the best to date for the property as a whole. Radiometry on the core showed counts-per-second (“cps”) of up to 65,000.
The last holes drilled in 2006 on the AM-15 zone (MT-06-30 to MT-06-38) showed the strength of the system. In addition to holes MT-06-30 and MT-06-35 referred to above, which intersected a high grade of more than 2.0% U3O8 over a substantial average width of 13.8 metres (45 feet), Hole MT-06-36 intersected 0.78% U3O8 over an impressive width of 23.4 metres (77 feet).
Definition drilling therefore led to a substantial increase in the number of pounds of uranium in the AM-15 zone.
Compelling results were generated by holes MT-06-31, 32, 33 and 37, drilled in the northern extension of Hole MT-06-30, and particularly by Hole MT-06-32. These holes were drilled to test the uranium potential at the ACF/CBF contacts. Hole MT-06-32 was a pleasant surprise, intersecting two mineralized sections in the CBF, the first returning 1.66% U3O8 over 5.5 metres from the fault hangingwall, and the second yielding 0.81% U3O8 over 3.3 metres at the level of the fault.
Exploration holes MT-06-20 to MT-06-27, drilled on a grid of about 100 metres to the north of the AM-15 zone, all intersected the fault with typical alteration. Radiometry on the core indicated weak-to-moderate values of up to 2,500 cps, corresponding to Hole MT-06-25, which intersected 0.20% U3O8 over 1.5 metres in the CBF.

Exploration holes MT-06-22 to MT-06-26 each intersected the Matoush fault, with low to moderate grades over thicknesses of up to 1.5 metres in Hole MT-06-25.
Drilling resumed on January 10, 2007 following the Holiday break. The first phase of 2007 drilling is essentially aimed at testing the extension immediately south of the AM-15 zone. Six holes, MT-07-01 to MT-07-06, for which the geological logs were completed, were drilled for a total of 2.073 metres.
At the beginning of the year, Hole MT-07-01, the only hole drilled in the northern extension of the AM-15 zone, tested the possible continuity of the mineralization in the CBF layer above holes MT-06-32 and 33.
- 10 -
The hole confirmed the continuity of the structure and the usual alterations. The maximum radiometry recorded on the core was 2,500 CPS. Of holes MT-07-02, 03 and 04 drilled in the upper section of the ACF facies, Hole MT-07-03 proved the most interesting, yielding a mineralized intersection of 15.8 metres with up to 20,000 CPS.
Holes MT-07-5 and 06, drilled on the same section in the middle and lower ACF facies about 50 metres south of the AM-15 zone, both intersected mineralization in the form of pitchblende and uranophanes, with up to 13,000 and 15,500 CPS respectively. The mineralized intersection from MT-07-6 was exceptionally large, at 15.1 metres (50 feet).
The following table shows the location of holes MT-07-01 to MT-07-6 for which results have been obtained on April 10, 2007 from the SRC laboratory in Saskatoon

The true widths of the mineralized intersections in this release have not yet been determined.
Repairs to the winter road began in mid-January 2007 and a new 12-kilometre section was built. A substantial quantity of equipment has been mobilized, including a 45-person camp, which has been operational two months earlier than expected, in mid-April.
As of June 2007, exploration work had primarily consisted of drilling, with three drills operating on the site. Since the beginning of 2007 (to June 21), 55 holes including one wedge had been drilled for a total of 22,402 metres. Definition drilling continued on Zone AM-15 in preparation for a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) compliant resource estimate, as well as drilling on the north and south extensions of the zone. One drill was assigned to deep drilling and has completed four holes, not including one wedge and another hole left uncompleted. Exploration drilling was also testing the uranium potential of the CBF horizon from surface down to the -180-metre level.
As of April 2007, the Company, has received chemical analyses for 24 holes from the SRC laboratory in Saskatoon, as well as results for MT-07-01 to MT-07-08.
Drilling in the AM-15 area has indicated the presence of interesting uranium mineralization over a distance of more than 300 metres, with a core distance of 160 metres. The AM-15 horizon remains open both to the north and to the south.
- 11 -
Holes for which chemical analyses were received included nine holes drilled in the northern extension of AM-15, namely MT-07-26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 (the pierce point locations can be viewed on the Company’s web site at www.stratecoinc.com). The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined. Hole MT-07-29 returned the best value, with a grade of 1.97% U3O8, representing 39 lb/ton U3O8, over a length of 6.7 metres in the CBF horizon. These results are even more promising as the intersection corresponds to a fault in the hangingwall of the Matoush fault, 135 metres to the north of the Hole AM-15 intersection. Another hole of interest in this area is MT-07-33, drilled 25 metres to the north of MT-07-29. As in MT-07-29, the uranium mineralization is in the hangingwall of the Matoush fault. The mineralization was found in a 4.00-metre section of the hole, but sampling has not yet been completed. To date, grades of 1.49% U3O8 (30 lb/ton) over 0.3 m from 244.2 to 244.5 m and 1.18% U3O8 (24 lb/ton) over 0.8 m from 247.6 to 248.4 m had been obtained.
In the rich ACF horizon, also in the northern extension of the AM-15, Hole MT-07-35 returned the best intersection, 65 metres to the north of AM-15. A grade of 0.95% U3O8 (19 lb/ton) over a substantial length of 10.7 metres, including 1.61% U3O8 (32 lb/ton) over 5.9 metres, was obtained. This intersection, which displays intense fuschite, tourmaline and chlorite hydrothermal alteration with pichblende and uranophane, confirms the presence of a corridor of high grades and widths in the upper part of the ACF to the north of AM-15.
Three holes (MT-07-48, 50 and 54) were drilled in the southern extension of AM-15, in the lower CBF, between 10 and 20 metres above the ACF-CBF contact, to test the potential presence of a saccharoidal level recently identified in the northern extension of the AM-15. This level, which would add considerable value to the project, consists of fine, moderately silicified, porous sandstone with a sugar structure (saccharoidal). The results of visual examination and radiometry on the core are encouraging. In Hole MT-07-48, the mineralized zone is 7.0 metres long, with a cps of up to 3,000 associated with the pichblende. In Hole MT-07-50, the mineralization was intersected over 1.0 m with a maximum cps of 2,300, and in Hole MT-07-54, over 6.0 metres avec maximum cps of 5,300, but with 50% core loss.
Thirteen exploration holes were drilled in the southern extension of the AM-15 zone, over a strike length of 270 metres, being up to Section 35+15S, with Hole AM-15 lying on Section 31+50S. Most of these holes intersected the Matoush fault in the ACF. Chemical analysis results have been received for these thirteen holes. Except for Hole MT-07-18, which was drilled on the lake last winter and returned a grade of 0.21% U3O8 over 3.4 m, including 0.83% U3O8 (17 lb/ton) over 1.5 m, grades were below 0.10% U3O8 (4 lb/ton). For instance, Hole MT-07­10, with a pierce point 100 m south of AM-15 in the upper part of the ACF, returned a grade of 0.06% U3O8 over 4.0 m, including 0.19% U3O8 over 0.8 m.
One of the three drills was mobilized on February 10, 2007, for deep drilling to test the uranium potential of the basement rock (unconformity). In February 2007, the Company obtained the results for the first hole to reach the basement on the Matoush property, namely Hole MT-07-09, with a total length of 1,296 metres. In addition to Hole MT-07-09, three other holes were drilled, namely MT-07-15, 22 and 30, as well as a wedge (MT-07-22-A). A fourth exploration hole (MT-07-47) was drilled to test the basement 170 metres north of MT-07-30, but was left unfinished for technical reasons. One of these holes, MT-07-22, can be considered significant, as it intersected two intrusives, both containing uranium mineralization. The mineralization was intersected in the ACF at an average vertical depth of 700 metres, with the basement lying at 792 metres. The two intrusives are 60 metres apart down hole, with the second corresponding to the Matoush fault. Chemical analysis results were revealing, with respective grades of 1.18% U3O8 (24 lb/ton) over 0.6 metres and 0.30 U3O8 (6 lb/ton) over 1.40 metre.
Nine exploration holes (MT-07-36, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 49 and 53) were drilled to test the uranium potential of the CBF at a vertical depth between the -80 m and -160 m. This horizon typically contains low uranium grades. The five holes, centred at -100 m over a strike length of about 240 m, do not appear to have returned any significant mineralization, with counts per second ("cps") of less than 700. However, Holes MT-07-36 and 44, 105 metres apart with a pierce point at -160 m, are more promising. Hole MT-07-36 intersected a mineralized zone of interest over 3.15 metres with a cps of up to 6,300, and Hole MT-07-44 intersected two mineralized zones, the first 2.0 metres long with a cps of up to 3,900 in the CBF, and the second about 13 metres long in the ACF with a maximum cps oscillating from 650 to 2,700.
- 12 -
Hole MT-07-49 had a pierce point 185 metres to the north of AM-15 in the middle part of the ACF, this hole shows that the mineralization extends to the north. The 3.8-metre length of mineralized zone showed the presence of pichblende over its entire length, with a cps of 11,500.
Hole MT-07-23, drilled to test an IP geophysical anomaly outside the Matoush corridor, did not intersect any abnormal structure, and the anomaly remains unexplained.
In addition to the delay in obtaining chemical analysis results from the laboratory, the Company has experienced delays in sampling and consequently in shipments of samples due to a personnel shortage. The situation was recently remedied with the hiring of three geologists.
Exploration work on the Matoush project intensified in the third quarter, particularly as the summer season permitted prospecting and use of the heliportable drill.
Between July 3 and October 3, 2007, 65 holes were drilled on the Matoush project for a total of 14,983 metres.
Exploration drilling in the third quarter took place mainly along the Matoush fault, from the northwest end of the project (Matoush Extension) to the southern part of the Eclat property, 9 km south of the AM-15 zone. The holes in the northern and southern parts of the Matoush project were drilled with a Versa-type drill moved using an Astar 350 B-2 helicopter assigned permanently to the site by Canadian Helicopters. The location of the holes drilled in the third quarter of 2007 can be found in the Form 10QSB for the period ending September 30, 2007.
Aside from the exploration holes drilled from surface to the 60-metre thick ACF-3 level (which hosts the AM-15 zone), including those drilled in the AM-08 sector (ACF-1, 15 metres thick), the emphasis was on exploration drilling at depth in the nearly 400-m thick ACF-4. These holes were drilled to test a new geological model based on the potential presence of other zones lying parallel to the plunge of the AM-15 zone. The best results were obtained from holes MT-07-101, 110 and 116 drilled in mid-October.
Logging of Hole MT-07-101 showed 0.30% eU3O8 over 1.9 m in the upper part of the ACF-4, at -360 m. A maximum of 5,900 cps was recorded on the core. Hole MT-07-110, drilled 60 metres deeper and 50 metres further north, intersected two mineralized sections 4.2 metres apart, with the second corresponding to the Matoush fault. Logging indicated 0.09% eU3O8 over 1.11 m and 0.06% eU3O8 over 2.23 m. Finally, Hole MT-07-116, drilled 110 m further north and 150 metres deeper than MT-07-110, intersected a 0.40 m mineralized section at the contact of the fault (-525 m), with up to 32,000 cps. This hole could not be logged.
In-hole logging has become essential as the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) is literally overloaded. Pending receipt of its own probe, the Company is using a Gamma probe on loan from Cameco.
The third quarter was also very active at the prospecting level on the Matoush property, with conclusive results.
The primary objective of the summer 2007 prospecting program was the discovery of new uranium-bearing radioactive boulders or outcrops that could lead to a new mineralized zone. More than 10,000 hectares were covered. Prospecting was conducted systematically on lines spaced at 100 metres.
Most notably, this work led to the discovery of strongly radioactive blocks (5,000 to 61,000 cps) in the east-northeast corner of the Matoush property (Laurent-Martin showing), an outcropping radioactive zone (600 to 10,000 cps) at the northern edge of the North Block and a number of radioactive boulders on both the South and North blocks of the property.
The highly significant discovery of radioactive boulders of up to 61,000 cps made by prospectors from Exploration Sans Frontière subcontracted by the Company lies 5 km northeast of the AM-15 zone.
Geotechnical and metallurgy studies continued in parallel with field exploration work, along with the gathering of data for the environmental impact study.

On September 26, 2007, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle & Associates (Scott Wilson RPA) completed a NI 43-101 technical report on the Matoush property, including a resource estimate on the AM-15 core zone.
Scott Wilson RPA prepared the initial mineral resource estimate for the AM-15 core zone at Matoush using drillhole data available as of September 6, 2007. A set of cross sections and plan views were interpreted to construct three dimensional (3D) grade-shell wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 0.05% U3O8 and a minimum horizontal thickness of 2 metres. High grade assays were cut to 7% U3O8. Forty-four of the 119 drill holes in the AM-15 zone area were used to estimate the mineral resources. The mineralization making up the mineral resource is shared among four vertical lenses controlled by the Matoush Fault Zone (MFZ): Main Lens, South Lens, North Lens and an Upper Lens. Block model U3O8 grades within the wireframe models were estimated by ordinary kriging.

Mineral Resource Classification, Category and Definition
The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) guideline for resource classification includes the following definitions which are pertinent to the classification of the Matoush Property resource:
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
On the Matoush Property, Indicated mineral resources are estimated to total 201,000 tonnes grading 0.79% U3O8 containing 3.48 million pounds of U3O8. Inferred mineral resources are estimated to total 65,000 tonnes grading 0.43% U3O8 containing 0.62 million pounds.

The resource estimate does not take in account other mineralized zones intersected by drilling on the Matoush property. “The smaller and eroded AM-8 Zone is found at surface in ACF-1, approximately 200 metres vertically above the AM-15 zone. Uranium mineralization of undefined extent has also been intersected in ACF-2 (L-43 occurrence) and ACF-4 (22 Deep Occurrence, 0.31% U3O8 over 1.4 metres). The 22 Deep Occurrence is 200 metres above the basement unconformity and about 330 m vertically beneath the AM-15 zone. All of this mineralization is located within the MFZ and is, as referred to it earlier, Otish-type uranium mineralization.” (Scott Wilson RPA, Sept. 2007)
In the last quarter of 2007, drilling was mainly concentrated in the new MT-22 zone sector, located in the ACF-4 at a vertical depth of between -350 and -650 m, with the main goal of identifying new mineralization in order to increase the resource. During this last period, 20 holes were drilled for a total of 11,238 m.
Most of the holes drilled in this area (ACF-4) intersected significant U3O8 values at the intersection of the Matoush fault, generally over small widths. While MT-07-116, for instance, intersected 50,000 cps over 0.3 m, the gamma probe has not yet been used in this hole due to the excessive length of cable required (intersection at -600 vertical metres). The best results were obtained in the last two holes drilled in 2007, MT-07-129 and MT-07-130, 80 m apart at the same elevation (- 350m).
- 15 -
Hole MT-07-129, with a 5.3-m intersection grading 0.37% eU3O8 including 3.3 m of 0.51% eU3O8, was particular as the alteration halo in this hole is identical to the one around the AM-15 zone.
Hole MT-07-130 intersected a 5.8-metre mineralized zone grading 0.37% eU3O8. Exploration work stopped on December 21, 2007, for the holiday break.
ECLAT PROPERTY
Location and Access
The Eclat property is located in the Otish Mountains of northern Québec, immediately south of the Matoush property. The property is accessible by helicopter as well as by the winter road that links the Eastmain mine to Témiskamie. Please see Figure 1 at page 4 for the general location of Eclat property mining claims.
Mining Claims
The property consists of 90 mining claims covering 4,787 hectares. Vija Ventures Corporation holds a 100% interest in the property. Please see the General location map of the Matoush project Figure 2 at page 5 for the location of the mining claims of Eclat property.
A letter of intent dated July 12, 2005 granted the Company an option on a 100% interest. The interest applies to all minerals except diamonds.
The agreement provides for the Company to earn its 100% interest by making payments totalling $150,000 over four years, including $7,000 on signature of the agreement and $7,000 on the first, $20,000 on the second, $20,000 on the third and $96,000 on the fourth anniversary, by carrying out $500,000 in exploration over four years and by issuing 600,000 common shares of the Company over three years, of which 400,000 have already been issued. The property is subject to a 2% NSR.
Uranium Potential
The property is strategically located in a relatively unexplored area with known uranium potential. It is bordered to the north by the Matoush property, wholly-owned by the Company, and to the south by ground recently staked by Cameco Corporation.
The property lies in the southern extension of the Matoush structure, which was traced by Uranerz over 3,900 metres using ground VLF surveys conducted in the early 1980s. The holes drilled by Uranerz and the Company clearly show uranium potential.
The Matoush structure also appears to continue for at least two kilometres on the Eclat property, which adds to its value.
Exploration Work
Hole EC-06-01, drilled 5.8 kilometres south of Uranerz Hole AM-15, primarily to maintain certain mining claims in the area, confirmed the southern extension of the Matoush fault.
The results were compelling. The structure was intersected at 111 metres down the hole, at a vertical depth of 76 metres. While unmineralized, the typical tourmaline alteration of the structure was intersected over a 10-metre section, with the fault appearing to be strongly choritized. This hole therefore confirms the presence of the Matoush structure over a distance of more than seven kilometres.
The radiometry and magnetometry survey carried out by Aeroquest Limited in the fall of 2006 on the Matoush property also covered the entire Eclat property.
- 16 -
On the southern portion of the Matoush project, on Eclat property, 10 holes were completed (EC-07-01 to 07-10) for a total of 2,260 metres. These exploration holes drilled with the assistance of the helicopter allowed the Matoush fault to be accurately located on the Eclat property, with radiometry on the core showing a low cps. More drilling will be done in this area during winter 2008.
MATOUSH EXTENSION PROPERTY
The Matoush Extension property is located north, west and east of the Matoush property. Please see Figure 1 at page 4.
Mining Claims
Wholly-owned by the Company, the Matoush Extension property consists of 198 claims covering 11,504 hectares. These mining claims were acquired by the Company in the fall of 2005 and the winter and summer of 2006 to protect the area in the vicinity of the Matoush and Eclat properties. Please see the general location map of the Matoush project in Figure 2 at page 5.
The northern border of the property is very close to the northern edge of the Otish Basin. The property is broken up by a row of mining claims belonging to Pacific Bay.
With the addition of the Matoush Extension property, the Matoush project as a whole covers 23 kilometres along its north-south axis, intersected by a 900-metre section belonging to Consolidated Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd (See section on Pacific-Bay Matoush property below).
Exploration Work
No significant exploration work was conducted on the Matoush Extension property except for the radiometry and magnetometry survey, which covered most of the property.
On the northern portion of the Matoush project, on Matoush Extension property, exploration work in 2007 consisted in prospection and limited drilling. Prospecting was successful with the identification of an outcropping radioactive zone with 600 to 10,000 cps. Four drill holes were completed in the area for a total of 1,290 metres. Mixed results were obtained, the Matoush fault being laterally displaced.
PACIFIC-BAY MATOUSH PROPERTY
On October 29, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement in principle with Consolidated Pacific Bay Minerals Ltd. (“Pacific Bay”) allowing the Company to earn a 60% interest in 277 mining claims owned by Pacific Bay located in the Matoush District of Québec's Otish Mountains. The agreement was subject to the completion of a definitive option agreement and regulatory approval that took place on January 14, 2008. It calls for the Company to pay Pacific Bay a total of $500,000, issue 200,000 Strateco shares and incur $3 million in exploration expenditures over four years, including a minimum of 10,000 meters of drilling. As part of the transaction, the Company acquired one million units of Pacific Bay at a price of $0.30 per unit on January 14, 2008. Each unit consists of one common share and one warrant to purchase a common share at $0.60 per share for a period of 24 months.
As of October 29, 2007, the Company assumed direction of exploration activities on the property, including supervision of the drilling program completed in December 2007. The property covers an area of 145 square kilometres (56 square miles) in the Otish Mountains, where the Company has been drilling the Matoush high-grade uranium orebody originally discovered by Uranerz Exploration and Mining in the 1980's. The resource estimate for the property predates NI 43-101.

MONT-LAURIER PROPERTY - U3O8
100% INTEREST
Location and Access
The Mont-Laurier project is located in Pérodeau Township, 40 kilometres northeast of Mont-Laurier, Québec. The property is easily accessible by paved road from Mont Laurier.
Please see Figure 1 for the general location map of the Mont-Laurier property and the following Figure 3 for the location of the claims of the Company on the Mont-Laurier property.
Figure 3

Uranium Potential
The ground acquired lies within the Cabonga-Mont-Laurier radioactive district of the Grenville geological province. Intensive exploration work was conducted in the area from 1969 to 1981, after Canadian Johns-Manville discovered uranium mineralization in 1967.
The Company’s property covers ground previously held by Mont-Laurier Uranium Mines in the 1970s. The claims block straddles the crest of a northeast-trending anticline and covers the high-potential southern extension of the Tom Dick uranium zones.
The uranium occurs mainly as disseminated uraninite in metamorphosed white pegmatites, as well as in biotite gneiss and impure biotite feldspath quartzites. The paragneiss covers Archean granite gneiss exposed mainly in the eroded windows along the crest of the major northeast-trending anticlinal folds.
Two white pegmatite uranium zones have been identified in the centre-south portion of the ground held by the Company, previously known as the Lac Hanson claims. The largest zone, which is six metres thick and dips 20o to the northwest, has been traced over a distance of 365 metres to the northeast by trenching. Previous work reported an estimate of 544,000 tons grading 0.075% U3O8, or 1.5 lb/ton. The central portion of the Company’s property, on the same axis between the Lac Hanson and the Tom Dick zones, remains virtually unexplored due to the fluvio-glacial overburden.
To the north of the property, various zones of radioactive metamorphosed white pegmatite identified by Allied Mining, Canadian Johns-Manville and Mont-Laurier Uranium Mines Inc. indicate a potential for high-tonnage, low-grade, uranium deposits near surface and minable by open pit. SOQUEM also identified molybdenite in the white uranium-bearing pegmatite that could represent a subproduct and improve the economics of the deposit.
While the Mont-Laurier district is classified under pegmatite-type deposits, it displays a geological context similar to the deposit-rich geology of the Athabaska basin in Saskatchewan. Both contexts lie along a major discordance in the deformed bedrock underlying the Proterozoic sedimentary basin. The pegmatite origin of the rocks hosting the Mont-Laurier mineralization is the result of anatexy of the sandstone units during high-intensity metamorphosis.
In the past, Allied-Mining, Canadian Johns-Manville and Mont Laurier Uranium Mines Inc. all confirmed the area’s potential for high-tonnage, low-grade open-pit operations. This renewed interest in uranium exploration has been prompted by the meteoric rise in uranium prices from US $6.00 to $85.00/lb in recent years. Given its location, the sustained rise in uranium prices and growing demand for alternative energy sources, the Mont-Laurier property is a solid addition to the Company’s property portfolio.
Exploration Work
The Company initiated exploration work on the Mont-Laurier project in the summer and fall of 2006.
First, in mid-June 2006, a helicopter-borne geophysical survey was done over the entire property. The radiometry, Mag and VLF survey was flown along lines spaced at 100 metres, totalling 885 line-kilometres. Various anomalous zones were identified.
The radiometry anomalies, particularly the uranium anomalies, are primarily concentrated along a 200- to 1,000-metre wide, northeast striking band that crosses the entire property. This band of anomalies covers a distance of over 14 kilometres. The two most strongly-anomalous areas are in the north and south of the property.
Following this survey, prospecting was carried out on the most promising areas. This work primarily consisted of scintillometry prospecting over approximately 26 line-kilometres, blasting and collection of 73 samples in the Tom Dick area. Some 11.2 kilometres of linecutting was done in the Lac Hanson area.
This exploration work resulted in the identification of zones of high radioactivity (many times the background level) in the Tom Dick South, Hanson West and Hanson Centre areas. Occasional readings of over 10,000 cps were seen.
- 20 -
Local outcrop spectrometry measurements (GR-135 spectrometer) confirmed the presence of uranium in association with the target helicopter-borne anomalies. For instance, on an outcrop containing white pegmatite on Tom Dick South, the unit recognized as the host of uranium mineralization showed readings of 1,800 to 2,500 cps. Readings of 2,000 to 10,250 cps were recorded at sites on Hanson West, and 4,800 cps on Hanson Centre.
In 2007, the exploration program on the property consisted essentially of drilling.
From January to March 2007, a 2,614 metres - 32-holes drilling program was completed on Area A, B and C. This is the first program carried by the Company since the staking of the property in 2005 and since the work done by Mont-Laurier Uranium Mines in 1971 and SOQUEM in 1973.
In Area A (Lake Hanson West) the 2007 drilling was aimed at testing this zone on a 100-meter spacing drill grid over 1,000 metres of strike. A series of 28 mostly vertical holes (2,274 metres) were drilled to an average depth of about 81 metres. The key white pegmatite units alternating with granitic gneiss were intersected as expected but the dissemination of uranium-bearing minerals seems greater than expected. Decimetric to metric assayed intervals returned values below 0.05 % U3O8.
With those results, it appears difficult to correlate our observations with the historic resources reported for Hanson Lake West (544,000 tons, 0.075% U3O8).
In Area B between Hanson West and Tom Dick South, only one hole was drilled and abandoned at 54 metres. Water and logistic problems were encountered.
For the Area C (Tom Dick South) three drill holes totalling 285 metres were completed at the base of the escarpment bordering on the northern limit of the property with the property of Nova Uranium. Only minor intersections of decimetric width with grades below 0.02% U3O8 were obtained.
Even with the mixed results of the 2007 drilling program, the property still shows many exploration targets that were not covered by recent exploration works in particular the Hanson Center area, the Area B not drilled in 2007, the Area C with respect to the work and results from Nova Uranium and other radiometric airborne survey targets on our property.
APPLE PROPERTY
Mining claims
On August 28, 2007, the Company has acquired 100% the Apple uranium property, wholly owned by Virginia Mines Inc (“Virginia”) in consideration of 3,250,000 shares of the Company.
The agreement also provides for a 2% NSR royalty payable to Virginia, half of which can be bought back for CAN $1.0 million. The transaction closed on September 6, 2007.
The Apple property consists of 194 mining claims covering 9,928 hectares 80 km southeast of Radisson.
Location and access
The property is located at 75 km southwest of the Radisson airport, in the James Bay area. The property is accessible by a 40 km winter road from km 510 on the paved James Bay road. In summer, the property can be accessed by boat from the Trans-Taïga road. Please see Figure 1 at page 4 for the general location of the property and the Figure 5 on the next page for location of the claims.

Uranium potential
The project covers a portion of the Apple Formation, which came to light in the early 1970s with the discovery of several extensive uranium-pyrite matrix, quartz pebble conglomerate zones.
The Apple uranium deposit was in fact discovered in 1971 during an airborne survey. The International Nickel Company of Canada Limited (“INCO”) and James Bay Development Corporation subsequently conducted an extensive joint exploration program from 1972 to 1975, with INCO as the operator. A total of 65 holes were drilled for a total of 14,000 metres, and the uranium conglomerates were traced over a distance of eight kilometres along an east-west axis.
In 1974, INCO performed a resource estimate on a one-kilometre section covering seven subvertically-dipping zones. The non-NI 43-101-compliant estimate yielded 9,365,000 tons grading 0.054% U3O8 or 1.08 lb/ton for a total of 10.1 million pounds (GM 57894). This resource includes 4.3 million tons categorized as proven and probable and 5.0 tons categorized as possible. The literature (Robertson et al. 1986) reports a resource of 8.5 million tons grading 0.052% U3O8 (8.8 million pounds of U3O8) contained in a six-metre by one-kilometre wide envelope extending to a
- 22 -
depth of 300 metres, and remaining open at depth. A correlation was established between the highest uranium grades and the pyrite content. INCO dropped the property in 1975, and it has not been explored for uranium since.
Exploration work
In the fall of 2007, the Company conducted a helicopter-borne radiometry survey covering the entire property. This survey led to the identification of new radiometry anomalies and confirmed those identified by earlier surveys.
In early January 2008, the Company began construction of a 14-person camp. A 4,000-metre drilling program began in mid-February. Various targets will be tested.
MISTASSINI PROPERTY
On November 26, 2007, the Company signed an agreement in principle to earn a 60% interest in the uranium rights on the Mistassini property owned by Majescor Resources Inc. (“Majescor”), subject to signature of a definitive option agreement and regulatory approval. Majescor currently owns 100% of the uranium rights and Superior Diamonds Inc. ("Superior Diamonds ") owns 100% of the diamond rights on the Mistassini property, which is located in the Otish Mountains of Quebec, approximately 40 km south-west of the Company’s Matoush property.
The proposed option agreement calls for the Company to allow Majescor to contract Major Drilling's heliportable-drill rig, currently leased to the Company, to drill the Lac Mantouchiche showing in November-December 2007 in return for the Company securing a 30-day right of first refusal to enter into an option agreement with Majescor on the property, with the 30-day period to commence upon the Company's receipt of the drill results from Majescor.
Under the option agreement, the Company can earn an undivided 60% interest in the uranium rights on the property by incurring an aggregate of $1.3 million in exploration expenditures over three years. The Company must reimburse Majescor the cost of the drilling program (approx. $250,000) and incur an additional $250,000 in exploration expenses on the property in the first year, for a total first year firm commitment of $500,000. The remaining $800,000 in exploration expenses will be incurred equally in second year and third year.
During the option period, the Company will be the sole operator for all uranium exploration and will have full access to the property. Superior Diamonds will have access to the property to conduct exploration for diamonds and will be the sole operator of all diamond exploration. Superior Diamonds is entitled to a 2.0% Yellow Cake Royalty on the property. The parties agree to finalize a formal joint venture agreement within 90 days of the Company's election to option the property. The Company elected on February 14, 2008 to enter into this Option Agreement with Majescor.
OTHER PROPERTY
QUéNONISCA PROPERTY - ZN, PB, CU, AG
OPTION TO EARN A 50% INTEREST
The Quénonisca property consists of 33 claims for a total area of 1,799 hectares. It lies 180 kilometres northwest of Chibougamau, Québec, Canada.
On February 26, 1996, Altavista Mines Inc. (“Altavista”) obtained an exclusive, irrevocable option from SOQUEM to acquire a 50% undivided interest in the Quénonisca property as consideration for exploration work to be carried out under SOQUEM’s direction for a total of $75,000, plus an undertaking by Altavista to subsequently finance a minimum of $127,500 in exploration work by February 28, 1997. In 1997, stripping and drilling were carried out on the property. In 1998, three sulfide occurrences in stockworks were discovered on the Montagnes-Nord grid by SOQUEM.
- 23 -
In 1999, SOQUEM carried out a linear 19.6 line-kilometre magnetometer and Max-Min survey on the Montagnes-Nord grid. Various conductors were detected by this survey.
In the fall of 2000, SOQUEM conducted a 1,050-metre, eight-hole drilling program in order to test the best conductors detected in 1999. Numerous sections of mineralized cherts were intersected. Several lenses of pyrrhotite-rich massive sulfides were identified. The Company contributed 50% of the total $201,173 program cost for 2000.
No significant work was carried out on the Quénonisca property since 2001. The mining claims have been renewed.
Action Plan
In the coming months, the Company will continue to focus its exploration efforts on exploration and development of its best uranium and metals projects using advanced exploration methods. Based on industry trends and demand, the Company will also consider acquiring new mining properties for exploration. Financing may be required for this purpose in 2008.
The Company foresees drilling expenses of $26M on its properties in 2008 as follows: $22M on the Matoush property, $2.5M on Apple project, $450,000 on Pacific Bay-Matoush , $650,000 on Eclat property and $400,000 on Mistassini property.
Item 3:
