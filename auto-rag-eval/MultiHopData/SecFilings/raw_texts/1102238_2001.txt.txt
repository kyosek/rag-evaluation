ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
ARI's principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for ARI's present operations.
Details of ARI's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2001, are set forth in Schedules III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." The discussions set forth below under the headings "Real Estate" and "Mortgage Loans" provide certain summary information concerning ARI's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 2001, no single asset accounted for 10% or more of total assets. At December 31, 2001, 78% of ARI's assets consisted of real estate, 4% consisted of notes and interest receivable, 10% consisted of investments in equity investees, including IORI and TCI, and 3% consisted of pizza parlor equipment and related goodwill. The remaining 5% of ARI's assets were leasehold interests in oil and gas properties, cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and other assets. The percentage of assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of ARI's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
ARI's real estate is geographically diverse. At December 31, 2001, ARI's real estate was located in all geographic regions of the continental United States, other than the Northeast region, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below. ARI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest, Pacific and Midwest regions of the continental United States. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for a detailed description of ARI's notes receivable portfolio.

Real Estate
At December 31, 2001, 88% of ARI's assets were invested in real estate and the equity securities of IORI and TCI. ARI invests in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or nonleveraged basis. ARI's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships, properties held for sale and investments in equity securities of IORI and TCI.
Types of Real Estate Investments. ARI's real estate consists of apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, shopping centers and a merchandise mart), hotels and improved and unimproved land. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. Properties may be purchased subject to debt, or existing debt may be assumed and properties may be mortgaged, pledged or otherwise collateralized to obtain financing. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although ARI has typically invested in developed real estate, it may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Board of Directors). To the extent that it invests in construction and development projects, such as Four Hickory
Centre described below, ARI is subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects. Also at December 31, 2001, ARI had under construction Oaks of Vista Ridge, a 288 unit apartment complex in Lewisville, Texas and Vista Lago, a 206 unit apartment complex in Farmers Branch, Texas.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by ARI are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of owned real estate (excluding 54 parcels of improved and unimproved land, a hotel in Sofia, Bulgaria and a single family residence, described below) at December 31, 2001.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, amount of commercial square footage and number of hotel rooms owned and does not reflect the value of ARI's investment in each region. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for a detailed description of owned real estate.
Excluded from the table above are a 136 room hotel in Sofia, Bulgaria, a single family residence in Dallas, Texas and 54 parcels of improved and unimproved land consisting of: a 44.4 acre land parcel in Las Colinas, Texas; six parcels of land in Dallas County, Texas, totaling 391.8 acres; four parcels of land in Irving, Texas, totaling 278.5 acres; an 82.4 acre land parcel in Oceanside, California; four parcels of land in Tarrant County, Texas, totaling 129.8 acres; a 130.6 acre land parcel in Harris County, Texas; four parcels of land in Collin County, Texas, totaling 42.1 acres; 12 parcels of land in Farmers Branch, Texas, totaling 136.4 acres; two parcels of land in Plano, Texas, totaling 40.7 acres; a 1,070.9 acre land parcel in Austin, Texas; three parcels of land in Palm Desert, California, totaling 775.8 acres; a 63.3 acre land parcel in Travis County, Texas; a 171.7 acre parcel of land in Houston, Texas; a 54.2 acre land parcel in Fort Worth, Texas; a 99.1 acre land parcel in Lewisville, Texas; a 7.6 acre land parcel in Carrollton, Texas; a 131.3 acre land parcel in Nashville, Tennessee; three parcels of land in Riverside, California, totaling 1,677.8 acres; a 150.8 acre parcel of land in Denton County, Texas; and five additional land parcels totaling approximately 84.0 acres.

A summary of the activity in the owned real estate portfolio during 2001 is as follows:
Properties Held for Investment. Set forth below are the properties held for investment and the monthly rental rate for apartments and the average annual rental rate for commercial properties and the average daily
room rate and room revenue divided by total available rooms for hotels and occupancy at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 for apartments and commercial properties and average occupancy during 2001, 2000 and 1999 for hotels:
- -------- * Property was purchased or constructed in 2000 or 2001. ** Property was under construction in 2001.
Occupancy presented above and throughout this ITEM 2. is without reference to whether leases in effect are at, below or above market rates.
In 2001, ARI purchased the following property:
- -------- (1) 8.88 acres of Hollywood Casino land and 10.5 acres of Vista Ridge land given as consideration. Exchanged with TCI, a related party. (2) Assumed debt of seller. Exchanged with TCI, a related party.
In 2001, ARI sold the following properties:
- -------- (1) Debt assumed by purchaser. (2) Gain of $830 deferred until ARI-provided financing is collected. (3) Sold to TCI, a related party. Gain of $65 deferred until sale to unrelated party.

(9) In December 2001, TCI, a related party, purchased 100% of the outstanding common shares of National Melrose, Inc. ("NM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARI, for $2.0 million. NM owns the Executive Court Office Building. ARI has guaranteed that the asset will produce at least a 12% annual return on the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the asset fails to produce the annual return, ARI will pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the asset fails to produce a 12% return for a calendar year, TCI may require ARI to repurchase the shares of NM for the purchase price. Management has classified this related party transaction as a note payable to TCI.
Properties Held for Sale. Set forth below are the properties held for sale, consisting of improved and unimproved land:
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of ARI's assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, secured by income-producing real estate, unimproved land and partnership interests. Management expects that the percentage of ARI's assets invested in mortgage loans will decline, as ARI will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, ARI may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in the portfolio. Mortgage notes receivable consist of first mortgage loans.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2001, consisted of apartments, a commercial building, unimproved land and partnership interests. The type of properties subject to mortgages in which ARI invests may be altered without a vote of stockholders.
As of December 31, 2001, the obligors on $25.9 million or 79% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of ARI. Also at that date, $10.3 million or 31% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio was nonperforming.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage loan balance at December 31, 2001), by geographic region, of the commercial properties that serve as collateral for ARI's mortgage notes receivable. Excluded are $26.1 million of mortgage notes secured by unimproved land and other security. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for additional details of ARI's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2001 is as follows:
During 2001, $1.8 million in interest and $5.0 million in principal were collected on mortgage notes receivable.
First Mortgage Loans. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan at or prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal or all interest and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is ARI's general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of ARI's mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes first mortgage loans funded in 2001, as well as events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 2001.
In July 2000, ARI sold a 749.1 acre tract of its Keller land parcel for $10.0 million, receiving $8.7 million in cash and providing purchase money financing of the remaining $1.3 million of the sales price. The loan bore interest at 12.0% per annum. A payment of $500,000 principal and interest was collected in September 2000 and all remaining principal and interest was due July 31, 2001. The loan was secured by 100% of the shares of DM Development, Inc. and an assignment of land sales proceeds. In March 2001, $850,000 in principal and interest was collected. In June 2001, the loan was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In August 2000, ARI sold a 20.5 acre tract of its Mason Goodrich land parcel for $3.6 million, receiving $2.1 million in cash and providing purchase money financing of the remaining $1.5 million of the sales price. The loan bore interest at 13.5% per annum, and matured in December 2000. All principal and interest were due at maturity. In February 2001, the loan was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In March 2001, ARI sold a 20.0 acre tract of its Katrina land parcel for $2.8 million, receiving $700,000 in cash and providing purchase money financing of the remaining $2.1 million of the sales price.

In June 2001, the interest rate was increased to 12.0% and the maturity date was extended to August 2001. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest were due at maturity. In July 2001, the note was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In November 2001, ARI sold a 12.71 acre tract of its Santa Clarita parcel for $1.9 million, receiving $1.5 million in cash and providing purchase money financing of the remaining $437,000 of the sales price. The loan bears interest at 8.0% per annum and matures in November 2002. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest are due at maturity.
Also in November 2001, ARI sold the Blackhawk Apartments for $7.1 million, receiving $1.5 million in cash after the assumption of $4.0 million of mortgage debt and providing purchase money financing of the remaining $1.6 million of the sales price. The loan bears interest at 10.0% per annum and matures in May 2002. Monthly principal and interest payments are required. All remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest are due at maturity.
Other. In September 1999, in conjunction with the sale of two apartments in Austin, Texas, $2.1 million in purchase money financing was provided, secured by limited partnership interests in two limited partnerships owned by the buyer. The financing bore interest at 16.0% per annum, required monthly payments of interest only at 6.0%, beginning in February 2000 and required a $200,000 principal paydown in December 1999, which was not received, and matured in August 2000. ARI had the option of obtaining the buyer's general and limited partnership interests in the collateral partnerships in full satisfaction of the financing. In March 2000, ARI agreed to forbear foreclosing on the collateral securing the note and released one of the partnership interests, in exchange for a payment of $250,000 and executed deeds of trusts on certain properties owned by the buyer. In March 2000, the borrower made a $1.1 million payment, upon receipt of which ARI returned the deeds of trust. The borrower executed a replacement promissory note for the remaining note balance of $1.0 million, which is unsecured, non-interest bearing and matures in April 2003. In April 2000, ARI funded a $100,000 loan to the borrower. The loan was secured by five second lien deeds of trust, was non-interest bearing and matured in September 2001. Payment was not received at maturity, and ARI began to accrue default interest. In December 2001, the $100,000 loan was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In December 1999, a note with a principal balance of $1.2 million, secured by a pledge of a partnership interest in a partnership which owns real estate in Addison, Texas, matured. The maturity date was extended to April 2000 in exchange for an increase in the interest rate to 14.0% per annum. All other terms remained the same. In February 2001, the loan amount was increased to $1.6 million and the maturity date was extended to June 2001. In February 2002, $1.5 million in principal and $87,000 in interest were collected. ARI has demanded payment of the remaining $84,000 in principal plus accrued but unpaid interest.
In August 1998, a $635,000 loan was funded to La Quinta Partners, LLC. The loan was secured by interest bearing accounts prior to their being used as escrow deposits toward the purchase of 956 acres of land in La Quinta, California, and the personal guarantee of the manager of the borrower. The loan had an extended maturity date of November 1999. All principal and interest were due at maturity. In November and December 1998, $250,000 in principal paydowns were received. In the second quarter of 1999, the loan was modified, increasing the interest rate to 15.0% per annum and extending the maturity to November 1999. Accrued but unpaid interest was added to the principal balance, increasing it by $42,000 to $402,000. In the fourth quarter of 1999, an additional $2,000 was funded increasing the loan balance to $404,000. In March 2000, $25,000 in interest was collected and the loan's maturity was extended to April 2000. The borrower did not repay the loan at maturity. In March 2001, a settlement was reached, whereby ARI collected $410,000 in full satisfaction of the note.
Related Party. In March 2001, ARI funded $13.6 million of a $15.0 million unsecured line of credit to One Realco Corporation ("One Realco"), which owns approximately 14.8% of the outstanding shares of ARI's Common Stock. The line of credit bears interest at 12.0% per annum. All principal and interest were due at maturity in February 2002. The line of credit is guaranteed by BCM. In June 2001, $394,000 in principal and $416,000 in interest was collected. In December 2001, $21,000 in principal and $804,000 in interest was collected.

During 2001, Mr. Kimbrough did not participate in day-to-day operations or management of One Realco.
In October 1999, ARI funded a $4.7 million loan to Realty Advisors, Inc., an affiliate. The loan was secured by all of the outstanding shares of common stock of American Reserve Life Insurance Company. The loan bore interest at 10.25% per annum, and matured in November 2001. In January 2000, $100,000 was collected. In November 2001, the maturity date was extended to November 2004.

Investments in Real Estate Companies and Real Estate Partnerships
Real estate entities. ARI's investment in real estate entities includes the equity securities of two publicly traded real estate companies, IORI and TCI, and interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. BCM, ARI's advisor, also serves as advisor to IORI and TCI.
Since acquiring its initial investments in IORI and TCI in 1989, ARI has made additional investments in the equity securities of both entities through private and open market purchases. The cost with respect to shares of IORI and TCI at December 31, 2001 totaled $64.1 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of the equity securities of IORI and TCI was $75.3 million at December 31, 2001 and the aggregate market value was $71.9 million. The aggregate investee book value of IORI and TCI based upon the December 31, 2001 financial statements of each entity was $118.4 million. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
The Board of Directors has authorized the expenditure of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, shares of IORI and TCI, excluding private purchase transactions which are separately authorized. As of December 31, 2001, ARI had expended an aggregate of $8.6 million to acquire shares of IORI and TCI, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. ARI expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of IORI and TCI to the extent its liquidity permits.
On October 3, 2000, ARI and IORI entered into an agreement which provided IORI and ARI with an option to purchase 1,858,900 shares of common stock of TCI from a third party. On October 19, 2000, IORI assigned all of its rights to purchase such shares to ARI. The total cost to purchase the TCI shares was $30.8 million. In October 2000, ARI paid $5.6 million of the option price. In April 2001, the remainder of the option price was paid, and ARI acquired the TCI shares. See ITEM 1. "BUSINESS" for discussion of the proposed acquisition of TCI and IORI by ARI.
Pertinent information regarding ARI's investment in the equity securities of the IORI and TCI at December 31, 2001, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
IORI and TCI each own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which they have held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. ARI's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
ARI does not have a controlling equity interest in either IORI or TCI; therefore, it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of either of them. However, due to ARI's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of IORI and TCI and that IORI and TCI have the same advisor as ARI, ARI may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of IORI and TCI. ARI accounts for its investment in IORI and TCI using the equity method. Under the equity method, ARI recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of IORI and TCI currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The
carrying value of ARI's investment in IORI and TCI, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of investment in each adjusted for ARI's proportionate share of IORI's and TCI's income or loss and distributions received.
The following summary description of IORI and TCI is based upon information publicly reported by each entity.
IORI. IORI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized on December 14, 1984, as a California business trust and commenced operations on April 10, 1985. IORI's business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships.

At December 31, 2001, IORI owned 16 income producing properties located in three states. These properties consisted of seven apartments comprising 777 units and seven office buildings with an aggregate of 459,549 sq. ft. In addition, IORI owned two parcels of unimproved land, totaling 205 acres.

TCI. TCI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized on September 6, 1983, as a California business trust, and commenced operations on January 31, 1984. On November 30, 1999, TCI acquired, through merger, Continental Mortgage and Equity Trust ("CMET"), both of which, at the time, were equity investees of ARI. Pursuant to the merger agreement, TCI acquired all of the outstanding CMET shares of beneficial interest in a tax-free exchange of shares, issuing 1.181 shares of its common stock for each outstanding CMET share.
TCI has investment policies similar to those of IORI. TCI holds equity investments in apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers) and hotels throughout the continental United States with a concentration in the Southeast and Southwest regions. At December 31, 2001, TCI owned 112 income producing properties located in 19 states. These properties consisted of 57 apartments comprising 10,714 units, 31 office buildings with an aggregate of 4.1 million sq. ft., 13 industrial warehouses with an aggregate of 2.0 million sq. ft., six shopping centers with an aggregate of 622,661 sq. ft., a fitness club with 56,532 sq. ft. and four hotels with a total of 209 rooms.

TCI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest regions of the continental United States.
TCI reported net income of $19.8 million in 2001 and $29.8 million in 2000. TCI's net income in 2001 included gains from the sale of real estate of $54.3 million, whereas its net income in 2000 included gains from the sale of real estate of $50.6 million. TCI's cash flow from property operations was $56.0 million in 2001.

At December 31, 2001, TCI owned 345,728 shares of IORI's common stock, approximately 24.0% of the shares then outstanding.
In 2001, ARI received a total of $53,000 from TCI in accumulated dividends on shares of CMET that should have been exchanged for TCI common stock in 1999.
Elm Fork Ranch, L.P. In June 2000, ARI sold its partnership interests for $2.0 million in cash, retaining an option to repurchase its interests. In January 2001, ARI purchased 100% of the partnership interests for $9.2 million, including financing of $9.0 million.
ART Florida Portfolio II, Ltd. In January 2002, Investors Choice Florida Public Funds II, in which ART Florida Portfolio II, Ltd. owned an interest, sold Villas Continental Apartments. ARI received $1.0 million in cash from the sale. ARI's share of the loss incurred on the sale was $531,000, which will be included in equity in income of investees in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
