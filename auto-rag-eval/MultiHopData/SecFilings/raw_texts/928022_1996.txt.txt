ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and explor- ation of oil and gas properties and natural gas transmission and provides oil and gas property management services for other investors. The Company's properties are concentrated in Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 1996, the Company's estimated proved reserves totaled 3.8 million barrels of oil and 50.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with a pre-tax present value, discounted at 10%, of the estimated future net revenues based on constant prices in effect at year-end ("Discounted Cash Flow") of $160.2 million. Gas constitutes approximately 69% of the Company's total estimated proved reserves and approximately 95% of the Company's reserves are proved producing reserves. The Company operates 149 wells representing approximately 78% of the total Discounted Cash Flow attributable to estimated proved reserves.
Significant Producing Properties
The following table shows Discounted Cash Flows and estimated net proved oil and gas reserves by major field for the Company's five largest producing fields and for all other properties combined at December 31, 1996.
Main Pass 163 Area
In two separate transactions during 1996, Callon acquired a 100% working interest in Chandeleur Block 41 and Main Pass Blocks 159, 160, 161 and 163. The acquisition initially included five wells producing 4 MMcf/d, as well as production facilities at Main Pass 163 capable of handling 90 MMcf/d.
Based upon interpretation of seismic data acquired and processed by Callon an exploratory well was drilled on Main Pass Block 163 during the fourth quarter of 1996. At year-end the well was producing 18 MMcf/d. A development well was also drilled on Main Pass Block 161 and tested at a rate of 4 MMcf/d. This well and four others were shut-in at year-end waiting on compression equipment upgrades scheduled for the first quarter of 1997.
The Main Pass 163 Area wells produce from Shallow Miocene reservoirs at approx- imate depths of 3,300 feet. Proved reserves at year-end attributable to this area were 20.2 Bcf, representing 34.7% of the Company's Discounted Cash Flow.
Chandeleur Block 40
The Company and an institutional investor purchased a 33.3% working (27.8% net revenue) interest in Chandeleur Block 40 in 1994. On December 29, 1995, Callon acquired an additional 66.7% working (55.5% net revenue) interest in the Chandeleur Block 40 for $9 million and subsequently sold a 22.2% working
interest in the field to the William G. Helis Interest for $3 million. The Company currently holds a combined 52.3% working (43.6% net revenue) interest in this property. The field's remaining proved reserves are estimated to be 16.8 Bcf of natural gas (net to the Company).
When the Company assumed operations of the field, two wells were producing 5.5 MMcf per day of natural gas from the 3,800 foot sand. In February 1996, the Company shut-in one well and successfully reworked the other and increased field production to 12 MMcf/d of natural gas.
During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company drilled a development well in the field which began producing in mid-December at the rate of 21 MMcf/d. The well resulted in a field extension which added 6 Bcf in net reserves to the Company. Total field production was approximately 30 MMcf/d at December 31, 1996.
Big Escambia Creek
On June 29, 1995, the Company purchased an average working interest of 6.0% (6.6% net revenue interest), subject to a 10% reduction after payout, in nine wells and a 2.9% average royalty interest in another six wells. The gross average daily production for these wells at December 31, 1996 was 3.0 MBbls of condensate, 1.6 MBbls of natural gas liquids, 7.6 MMcf of residue natural gas and 330 long tons of sulphur. These wells are producing from the Smackover formation at depths ranging from 15,100 to 15,600 feet. Production in this field has been partially curtailed due to low treatment plant capacity and, as a result, no significant field production decline occurred during the past several years.
Black Bay Complex
The Company-operated Black Bay Complex (the "Complex") is located in shallow waters off the Louisiana coast. It consists of eight fields, 90 producing wells and approximately 30,000 acres of oil and gas leases, all of which are held by production. The Company owns an average 15.4% working (11.6% net revenue) interest in the Complex and an institutional investor, whose pro- perties are managed by the Company, owns a 32.6% working interest. At December 31, 1996 the Complex was producing 4,750 barrels of oil per day and cumulative production had reached 241 million barrels of oil and 216 Bcf of natural gas.
The discovery well in the Complex was completed in 1949. Forty-five different sandstone formations and 137 separate reservoirs ranging in depth from 6,200 to 9,600 feet have been identified within the Complex. The Company assumed operations of the Complex in August 1992, and since that time the Company has successfully drilled seven development wells, including a horizontal well, and implemented fourteen recompletions, seven of which employed a new stimulation technology.
North Dauphin Island Field
The Company owns a 94.4% working (72.6% net revenue) interest in the North Dauphin Island Field located in shallow Alabama state waters. The field was discovered in April 1990, and the wells produce from a Shallow Miocene reservoir at approximately 1,800 feet. At December 31, 1996, there were three producing gas wells, two of which were drilled horizontally, with gross production of 7.5 MMcf per day.
The Company also owns a production platform, including compressors and dehydra- tion facilities, an associated gathering system and a 12-inch, 12-mile pipeline ("North Dauphin Island Platform"). This pipeline runs to existing onshore con- nections with the pipeline systems of Koch Gateway Pipeline Company, Trans- continental Gas Pipe Line Corporation and Florida Gas Transmission Company. The Company gathers its production and gas production from other producers connected to its system, and transports the gas to the major pipeline con- nections. The current throughput capacity of the gathering and transportation facility is in excess of 100 MMcf per day and with additional compression, the
throughput capacity can be increased to 130 MMcf per day. The ownership of the North Dauphin Island Platform and associated pipeline provides the Company with a significant strategic advantage in the North Dauphin Island area.
In 1995, the Company signed an agreement with a subsidiary of a major oil company providing for natural gas gathering services and transportation through the North Dauphin Island Platform to onshore pipeline connections. The agree- ment further provides for the subsidiary to purchase firm capacity commitments from the Company for natural gas deliveries through the North Dauphin Island Platform for 15 years, which commended in April 1996, to transport up to 100 MMcf per day of the subsidiary's natural gas production. Firm capacity reserva- tions will average over $1.0 million per year through the term of the contract. Additional revenues may be received depending upon the actual throughput used by the subsidiary.
Exploration and Development Projects
Over the last two years, the Company shifted the focus of its operations from the acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties to exploratory and developmental drilling. The Company's exploration and development activity is focused primarily in three areas in the Gulf of Mexico: the Shallow Miocene focus area, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf Region and the Breton Sound area.
Shallow Miocene Area
In December 1995, Callon began implementing its new business strategy by acquiring an additional interest in Chandeleur Block 40 which increased its ownership to a 52.3% working interest. In June 1996, Callon, through a property exchange with an industry partner, acquired a 64% average working interest in Chandeleur Block 41, Main Pass 159, 160, 161 and 163 in the OCS in the Gulf of Mexico. In July and August, Callon acquired acreage interests in Main Pass 164 and 165 and an interest in the production facilities at Main Pass 164. In October, Callon acquired additional interests in Chandeleur Block 41 and Main Pass 159 and 161. As a result of these acquisition efforts, Callon has developed a concentrated leasehold position of 33,300 net acres in eight contiguous blocks on which it has 11 producing wells. It owns a 100% working interest in five of the blocks and an average 55% working interest in the remaining three. Callon also owns a 100% working interest in the production facilities at Main Pass 163 and an approximate 55% working interest in the production facilities at Chandeleur Block 40 and Main Pass Block 164. During the third quarter, Callon completed the acquisition and processing of more than 1,000 miles of seismic data over these blocks and identified eight potential drilling locations.
During September and October, three Shallow Miocene prospects were successfully drilled and completed. The first prospect was drilled on Main Pass 163 and encountered 54 feet of net pay in a new natural gas reservoir at approximately 3,300 feet. The Company has a 100% working (83% net revenue) interest in the well and it is producing approximately 18 MMcf/d (15 MMcf/d net to the Company) at December 31, 1996. The second drilled prospect, Chandeleur Block 40, encountered 44 feet of net pay at a depth of approximately 3,850 feet. Along with the previously existing well which is producing 9.2 MMcf/d, total production from Chandeleur Block 40 stands at 30.2 MMcf/d at December 31, 1996. This estimated 21 MMcf/d increase in production will add 9.2 MMcf/d net to the Company's 52% working (43.6% net revenue) interest. The third prospect was a sidetracked development well at Main Pass 161. This well was completed and tested at a rate of 4 MMcf/d. Callon's 100% working (77.8% net revenue) interest in the well should add 3 MMcf/d to our existing production when the compression facilities are upgraded in the first quarter of next year.
During 1997, the Company's Shallow Miocene plans include the drilling of at least two developmental wells and performing one major workover and one recompletion. Also during 1997, the Company will continue evaluating additional acquisition, exploration and development opportunities in this area.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Region
In addition to the prospects in its Shallow Miocene focus area, the Company has developed an inventory in the OCS which is intended to explore for reserves at depths generally in excess of 10,000 feet. Callon entered this area by enter- ing into a joint bidding agreement with Murphy Oil Corporation and participating in the Outer Continental Shelf lease sales conducted by the Minerals Management Service. In April 1996, the Callon/Murphy team was the high bidders on 13 lease blocks encompassing 61,000 acres located in offshore Louisiana waters. These blocks included six in the West Cameron South Addition, two in Mississippi Canyon and one block each in Eugene Island, South Marsh Island, Vermillion and Main Pass East Addition. In September, Callon again joined with Murphy and was the high bidder on six offshore Texas tracts encompassing 35,000 acres. These blocks include two in the High Island East Addition South Extension, one in the High Island South Addition and three in Garden Banks. Callon owns a 25% working interest in the offshore lease blocks acquired jointly with Murphy.
The Company's 1997 drilling program currently includes ten exploratory wells on eight blocks. The Company's plans for its deep water prospects on the Mississippi Canyon and Garden Banks blocks have not yet been finalized. The Company also plans to again participate with Murphy in the 1997 federal lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico.
Breton Sound
The Company's Breton Sound focus area is located in shallow state waters off the Louisiana coast at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Callon owns interests in and operates several large old prolific fields there, including the Main Pass 32/35 area and the Black Bay Complex consisting of eight fields. The Company's focus has been on the exploitation of the known producing horizons and now is directed toward deeper potential prospects.
Main Pass Block 35. Since its discovery in 1951, production from Main Pass Block 35, located in Louisiana state waters, has totaled 66.4 MMBbls of oil and 76 Bcf of natural gas from 28 reservoirs ranging in depth from 6,000 to 9,000 feet. The Company purchased a 10% working interest in the field in 1991, increasing to 19% after payout to the Company's institutional investor who owns the remaining interest. After extensive analysis of seismic data from the area, the Company believes there is exploration potential in deeper sands, and in 1995, purchased a 100% interest in two lease blocks that offset the producing block. The Company contracted a 36 square-mile, 3-D seismic survey, which commenced in July 1995, and covers the producing and newly acquired leases.
In November 1996, the Company received the survey covering its Main Pass 32/35 area. Callon identified numerous prospects both under and outside of its then existing 4,467-acre Main Pass 32 lease. Based upon the new seismic, in December 1996, the Company acquired six contiguous tracts covering an additional 5,170 acres at a total cost of $3.1 million. The Company anticipates drilling activities to begin in this area by mid-year 1997. The Company's interest in the activities will vary between 10% and 100%, depending on the extent to which the various leases are pooled.
Black Bay Complex. The Black Bay Complex was discovered in 1949 and since that time has produced 237 MMBbls of oil and 213 Bcf of natural gas from 45 sandstone formations and 137 reservoirs with depth ranging from 6,200 to 9,600 feet. It consists of eight fields with 90 wells producing 4,750 barrels of oil per day and 30,000 acres of oil and gas leases held by production. Callon holds an average 15.4 percent working (11.6 percent net revenue) interest in the Complex and manages a 32.6 percent working interest for an institutional investor.
Since assuming operations of the Complex in 1992, the Company has substantially reduced operating costs, successfully drilling six development wells, including one horizontally, and implemented 14 recompletions. Callon has an inventory of
over 32 identified development locations and recompletion candidates at Black Bay, and is evaluating the use of 3-D seismic to identify additional reserves.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The following table sets forth certain information about the estimated proved reserves of the Company as of the dates set forth below. 										 						 December 31, 					 -------------------------------- 					 1996 1995 1994(a) 						 (In thousands) Proved developed: Oil (Bbls) 3,385 3,890 3,309 Gas (Mcf) 49,491 20,408 20,582 								 Proved undeveloped: Oil (Bbls) 434 876 1,115 Gas (Mcf) 933 9,259 3,520

Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows $216,154 $95,730 $59,477
Discounted Cash Flows $160,171 $63,764 $41,383 		 __________ (a) Reserves prior to September 16, 1994 represent the combined reserves of the Company's predecessors.
The Company's independent reserve engineers (Huddleston & Co., Inc. of Houston, Texas) prepared the estimates of the proved reserves and the future net cash flows (and present value thereof) attributable to such proved reserves. Reserves were estimated using oil and gas prices and production and development costs in effect on December 31 of each such year, without escalation, and were otherwise prepared in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations regarding disclosure of oil and gas reserve information.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond the control of the Company and the reserve engineers. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve or cash flow estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors, such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors, such as an increase or decrease in product prices that renders production of such reserves more or less economic, may justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
The Company has not filed any reports with other federal agencies which contain an estimate of total proved net oil and gas reserves.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the wells drilled and completed by the Company during the periods indicated. All such wells were drilled in the continental United States including federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico.

__________ (a) Drilling results prior to September 16, 1994 represent the combined drilling results of the Company's predecessors.
The Company owned working and royalty interests in approximately 894 gross (35.93 net) producing oil and 316 gross (21.15 net) producing gas wells as of December 31, 1996. A well is categorized as an oil well or a natural gas well based upon the ratio of oil to gas reserves on a Mcfe basis. However, substantially all of the Company's wells produce both oil and gas. At December 31, 1996, the Company had three exploratory gas wells in progress.
Leasehold Acreage
The following table shows the approximate developed and undeveloped (gross and net) leasehold acreage of the Company as of December 31, 1996.

As of December 31, 1996, the Company owned various royalty and overriding royalty interests in 1,366 net developed acres and 6,953 undeveloped acres. In addition, the Company owned 5,464 developed and 134,536 undeveloped mineral acres.
Major Customers
For the year ended December 31, 1996, Northridge Energy Marketing Company, Williams Energy Services, Inc. and Sonat Gas Marketing Co. L. P. purchased 21%, 27% and 14%, respectively, of the Company's crude oil and natural gas produc- tion. Northridge purchased crude oil production from the Black Bay Complex, Williams Energy Services, Inc. purchased natural gas from the North Dauphin Island Field, and Sonat Gas purchased natural gas from Callon owned interests' in federal OCS leases, Chandeleur Block 40, Main Pass 163 and Main Pass 164/165. Because of the nature of oil and gas operations and the marketing of production, the Company believes that the loss of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to sell its products.
Title to Properties
The Company believes that the title to its oil and gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in the opinion of the Company, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such pro- perties. The Company's properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following: royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and gas leases; overriding royalties and other burdens created by the Company or its predecessors in title; a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles; back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments; liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements; pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property. To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect the Company's rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating the Company's net revenue interests and in estimating the size and
value of the Company's reserves. The Company believes that the burdens and obligations affecting its properties are conventional in the industry for pro- perties of the kind owned by the Company.
