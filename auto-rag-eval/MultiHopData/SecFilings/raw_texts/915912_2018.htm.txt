ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities. While we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis, we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, Redevelopment or Unconsolidated according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities in the markets where we have a significant presence (New England, New York/New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California) and where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the respective prior year. The Established Communities for the year ended December 31, 2018 are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2017, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the fiscal year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities are all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as January 1, 2018, or which were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other Stabilized Communities includes stabilized operating communities in our expansion markets of Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida, but excludes communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the fiscal year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's pre-redevelopment basis and is expected to have a material impact on the operations of the community, including occupancy levels and future rental rates.
•
Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity.
Development Communities are communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction and completed during the fiscal year. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, where we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land, where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community, or where we are the designated developer in a public-private partnership. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
We currently lease our corporate headquarters located in Arlington, Virginia, as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2018, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:
_________________________________
(1)
Development Communities excludes the development of 15 West 61st Street, expected to contain 172 residential units and 67,000 square feet of retail space. We are pursuing a potential for-sale strategy of individual condominium units for the residential portion, while we would maintain ownership of the retail portion.
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
We generally establish the composition of our Established Communities portfolio annually. Changes in the Established Communities portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
_________________________________
(1)
We remove a community from our Established Communities portfolio if we believe that planned activity for a community for the upcoming year will result in that community's expected operations not being comparable to the prior year period. We believe that a community's expected operations will not be comparable to the prior year period when we intend either (i) to undertake a significant capital renovation of the community, such that we would consider the community to be classified as a Redevelopment Community; (ii) to dispose of a community through a sale or other disposition transaction; or (iii) when a significant casualty loss occurs.
(2)
Community was moved from the Established Communities portfolio to the Other Stabilized portfolio as a result of a casualty loss that occurred during the year and impacted operations.
(3)
Includes the five wholly-owned communities contributed to the NYC Joint Venture.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities include garden-style apartment communities consisting of multi-story buildings of stacked flats and/or townhome apartments in landscaped settings, as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevator-served buildings of four or more stories, frequently with structured parking. As of January 31, 2019, our Current Communities consisted of the following:
As discussed in Item 1. “Business,” we operate under three core brands Avalon, AVA and Eaves by Avalon. We believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint. Our core “Avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services. “AVA” targets customers in high energy, transit-served urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus. “Eaves by Avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious, “value” segment in suburban areas. We believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price.
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service-oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe our mission of Creating a Better Way To Live helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed construction of seven communities containing 1,915 apartment homes, one of which was developed through an unconsolidated joint venture, and sold 10 operating communities containing an aggregate of 2,321 apartment homes, as well as the five communities contributed to the NYC Joint Venture. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 19.2 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the weighted average age of our Current Communities is 9.9 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2019, we owned (directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries):
•
252 operating communities, including 241 with a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest and 11 that are on land subject to a land lease. The land leases have various expiration dates from October 2026 to March 2142, and six of the land leases are used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration.
•
A general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the “U.S. Fund”), Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the “AC JV”) and North Point II JV, LP, subsidiaries of which own five, two and one operating communities, respectively. One community owned by the U.S. Fund is subject to a land lease.
•
A membership interest in four limited liability companies, one of which, the NYC Joint Venture, through subsidiaries owns a fee simple interest in three operating communities and a leasehold interest in two additional operating communities, and three ventures that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community.
•
A general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a “DownREIT,” as described more fully below, that owns one community.
We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in our Development Communities, as well as a mixed-use project currently being developed in which we are pursuing a potential for-sale strategy of individual condominium units.
In our partnership structured as a DownREIT, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. Limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Under the partnership agreement for the DownREIT, the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2019, there were 7,500 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
Development Communities
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 21 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 6,609 apartment homes and 87,000 square feet of retail space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $2,383,000,000. Additionally, we are pursuing a potential for-sale strategy of individual condominium units for the residential portion of the 15 West 61st Street development, which is currently under construction and when completed is expected to contain 172 residential units and 67,000 square feet of retail space for a total capitalized cost of $620,000,000. We currently intend to own and operate the retail portion of the development. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually, or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (including the factors identified under “Forward-Looking Statements”) for further discussion of development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities (directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary) unless otherwise noted in the table.
_________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation retail tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Projected total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount unless otherwise noted.
(2)
Initial projected occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
Developments containing at least 10,000 square feet of retail space include Avalon Belltown Towers (11,000 square feet), AVA Hollywood (19,000 square feet), Avalon Saugus (23,000 square feet), and Avalon Harrison (27,000 square feet).
(5)
We signed a land disposition and development agreement with the transportation authorities controlling such property relating to the development of this community. During the fourth quarter of 2018, all internal Company approvals were given to authorize the commitment of funds for the construction of this community.
(6)
Development Communities excludes 15 West 61st Street, which is currently under construction. 15 West 61st Street is expected to contain 172 residential units and 67,000 square feet of retail space when completed and is expected to be developed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $620 million. We are currently pursuing a potential for-sale strategy of individual condominium units for the residential portion and currently intend to own and operate the retail portion of the development, both of which are expected to complete construction during 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the development of the following communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Total capitalized cost is as of December 31, 2018. We generally anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments.
(2)
We developed this project with a private development partner. We own the rental portion of the development on floors 3 through 19 and the partner owns the for-sale condominium portion of the development on floors 20 through 30. The information above represents only our portion of the project. We provided a construction loan to the development partner, which is being repaid with proceeds the partner receives from the sale of the condominium portion of the project. The balance as of December 31, 2018 was $12.8 million, representing outstanding principal and interest, net of repayments, as discussed in Note 5, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
(3)
In February 2017, a fire occurred at Avalon Maplewood. See "Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses" for further discussion.
(4)
We developed this project within an unconsolidated joint venture that was formed in July 2016, in which we own a 55.0% interest. The information above represents the total cost for the venture.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2018, we had nine communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $177,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new Development Community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio. In addition, during 2018, we completed the reconstruction of the building that was destroyed in the Edgewater casualty loss in 2015. The new Edgewater building contains 240 apartment homes and was reconstructed for a total capitalized cost of $61,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the start of reconstruction. You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost does not include capitalized costs incurred prior to redevelopment.
(2)
Projected total capitalized costs represent the aggregate of any multiple phase redevelopments and the estimated reconstruction completion dates reflect all planned phases.
(3)
Estimated restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
Development Rights
At December 31, 2018, we had $84,712,000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own, and $47,443,000 in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 28 Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of December 31, 2018 includes $74,342,000 in original land acquisition costs, net of any impairment loss recognized. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9,769 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.
For 21 Development Rights, we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel. While we generally prefer to hold Development Rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land, for one Development Right we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. In addition, six Development Rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and will be constructed on land currently associated with, or adjacent to, those operating communities. During the next 12 months we expect to commence construction of an apartment community on the Development Right for which we currently own the land, with a carrying basis of $84,712,000.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights, for which future development is not yet considered probable, are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2018, we incurred a charge of $4,309,000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed.
You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The following presents a summary of the Development Rights:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation retail tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions.
Land Acquisitions
We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2018, we acquired land parcels for seven Development Rights, as shown in the table below, for an aggregate investment of $140,563,000. For all of the parcels, construction has either started or is expected to start within the next six months.
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land and related acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation retail tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, net of projected proceeds for any planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate.
(2)
Additional parcel of land acquired in 2018 for a current Development Community. The estimated number of apartment homes and projected total capitalized cost represent the amounts for the full Development Community.
Disposition Activity
We sell assets when they do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership, and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition, development or redevelopment activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019, we sold our interest in nine wholly-owned operating communities, containing 1,982 apartment homes, with an aggregate gross sales price of $688,750,000, excluding the five wholly-owned operating communities contributed to the NYC Joint Venture.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, along with other insurance policies we maintain, have policy specifications, insured and self-insured limits, exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels. We procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of $175,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes. However, for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in California or Washington, the loss limit is $150,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate. The deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in California is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $25,000,000 per loss. Limits, deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year.
Our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities. This master property program provides a $400,000,000 limit for any single occurrence, subject to certain sublimits and exclusions. Under the master property program, we are subject to a $100,000 deductible per occurrence, as well as additional self-insured retention for the next $350,000 of loss, per occurrence, until the aggregate incurred self-insured retention exceeds $1,500,000 for the policy year.
Our communities are insured for third-party liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance program. The master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions, and they require a self-insured retention of $500,000 per occurrence.
We also maintain certain casualty policies (general liability, umbrella/excess and workers compensation) for construction related risks which have various exclusions and deductibles that, in management’s view, are commercially reasonable. Certain projects are insured through our master insurance policies while others are insured through project-specific insurance policies. The limits vary by project and may be subject to deductibles up to $1,500,000 per occurrence.
We utilize a wholly-owned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks, which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses, general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks. In addition to our potential liability for the various policy self-insured retentions and deductibles, our captive insurance company is directly responsible for (i) 25% of the first $50,000,000 of losses (per occurrence) incurred by the master property insurance policy and (ii) covered liability claims arising out of our commercial general liability policy, subject to a $2,000,000 per occurrence loss limit. The captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk, which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. Our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) program. This coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures (subject to deductibles and insured limits) and certain property insurance policies. We have also purchased private-market insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of $600,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages (not covered under TRIPRA) such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions.
An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) and limited cyber liability insurance. The crime policies protect us, up to $30,000,000 per occurrence (subject to sublimits and exclusions), from employee theft of money, securities or property. The limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of $15,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. The cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach, wrongful acts, data privacy issues and media liability.
The amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses.
Maplewood Casualty Loss
In February 2017, a fire occurred at Avalon Maplewood, located in Maplewood, NJ ("Maplewood"), which at the time was under construction and not yet occupied. The Company completed reconstruction of the damaged and destroyed portions of the community as well as the vertical construction of the community in 2018. In 2017, we reached a final insurance settlement for the property damage and lost income for the Maplewood casualty loss of $19,696,000, after self-insurance and deductibles, of which $3,495,000 was recognized as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Edgewater Casualty Loss
In January 2015, a fire occurred at our Avalon at Edgewater apartment community located in Edgewater, NJ (“Edgewater”). Edgewater consisted of two residential buildings. One building, containing 240 apartment homes, was destroyed. The second building, containing 168 apartment homes, suffered minimal damage and has been repaired. In January 2016, we reached a final settlement with our property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the Edgewater casualty loss, for which we received aggregate insurance proceeds of $73,150,000, after self-insurance and deductibles. We received $44,142,000 of these recoveries in 2015, and the remaining $29,008,000 in 2016, of which $8,702,000 was recognized as an additional net casualty gain and $20,306,000 as business interruption insurance proceeds.
In 2017, we commenced the reconstruction of the destroyed building, which we completed in 2018.
To date, a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us, including four class actions, approximately 23 individual actions, and subrogation actions by insurers who provided renters insurance to our residents. While we can give no assurances, we believe that any remaining liability will be covered by third party insurance and/or will not have a material impact on our statement of financial position or operations.
ITEM 3.
