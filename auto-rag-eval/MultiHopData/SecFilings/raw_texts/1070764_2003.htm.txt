(1)
No one single tenant exceeds 10% of the gross leasable area.
(2)
A tenant in this propery has filed a bankruptcy petition, rejected its lease and the space has not been re-leased.
(3)
Earnouts are agreements with certain sellers obligating us to pay additional amounts based on a predetermined formula applied to rental income to be received from specific tenants, when those tenants occupy their space and begin to pay rent.
*
Major tenants include tenants leasing more than 10% of the gross leasable area of a property.
**
Birkdale's GLA (gross leasable area) includes retail, office and apartments. Major tenants listed are part of the retail space only.
NOTE
See Schedule III, in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for initial property costs.
The majority of income from our properties consists of rent received under long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for the monthly payment of fixed minimum rent in advance and for payment by tenants of a pro rata share of real estate taxes, special assessments, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance, management fees, and certain building repairs of the shopping center. Some of the major tenant leases provide that the landlord is obligated to pay certain of these expenses above or below specific levels. Some of the leases also provide for the payment of percentage rent, calculated as a percentage of a tenant's gross sales above predetermined thresholds.
The following table lists the approximate physical occupancy levels for our investment properties as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. N/A indicates that the property was not owned by us at the end of the year.
*
As part of the purchase of these properties, we are entitled to receive payments in accordance with master lease agreements for tenant space, which was not producing revenue either at the time of, or subsequent to the purchase. The master lease agreements cover rental payments due for a period ranging from one to three years from the purchase date. The percentages in the table above do not include non-revenue producing space covered by the master lease agreements. For those properties which are covered by a master lease agreement, our financial occupancy ranges from 87% to 100% as of December 31, 2003.
Dev
Development property.
(NR)
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of this investment property for which we have funded a mortgage note receivable, which is secured by the underlying property. As a result of the amount funded, we are considered the owner of the property for financial reporting purposes because we effectively maintain the risks and rewards of ownership due to the limited equity provided and the minimal risk of loss to be incurred by the borrower.
(V)
Property includes bankrupt tenant with greater than 10,000 square feet vacant.
Item 3.
