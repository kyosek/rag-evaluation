ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The information included in this Report about the Company's proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 1997, including estimated quantities and SEC 10 value, is based on reserve reports prepared by the Company's engineers for all properties other than Canada, which have been prepared by Martin Petroleum & Associates and Gilbert Laustsen Jung Associates.
Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the Company's control. This Report contains estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and the related future net revenues, which are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues,
taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and related SEC 10 value of proved reserves set forth in this Report. In addition, the Company's reserves may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore, estimates of the SEC 10 value of proved reserves contained in this Report should not be construed as estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.
SEC 10 value is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas prices prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions. SEC 10 values as of any date are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Accordingly, estimates of future net revenues in this Report may be materially different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.
The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves during 1997 to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC.
Proved Reserves
The Company's proved reserves totaled 761.6 million BOE at December 31, 1997, 302.2 million BOE at December 31, 1996 and 296.8 million BOE at December 31, 1995, representing $3.1 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in SEC 10 value. The Company achieved these annual increases in reserves despite having sold reserves of 18.1 million BOE in 1997, 45.8 million BOE in 1996 and 34.8 million BOE in 1995.
On a BOE basis, 86% of the Company's total proved reserves at December 31, 1997 are proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 1997 and using the Company's reserve report production information for 1998, the reserve-to-production ratio associated with the Company's proved reserves is 11.3 years on a BOE basis. The following table provides information regarding the Company's proved reserves by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 1997.
PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES
- --------------- (a) The 1997 average daily production is calculated using a 365-day year and without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or drilling activity that occurred during the year.
Reserve Replacement
For the ninth consecutive year, the Company was able to replace its annual production volumes with proved reserves of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, stated on an energy equivalent basis. During 1997, the Company added 512.9 million BOE resulting in reserve replacement of 1450% of total production. Of the 512.9 million BOE reserve additions, 457.7 million BOE were added through acquisitions of proved properties, 2.4 million BOE were added through
exploration and development drilling activities and 52.8 million BOE were the net result of revisions. Reserves added by development drilling are primarily from the identification of additional infill drilling locations and new secondary recovery projects. Reserve revisions result from several factors including changes in existing estimates of quantities available for production and changes in estimates of quantities which are economical to produce under current pricing conditions. The Company's reserves as of December 31, 1997 were estimated using a price of $16.89 per Bbl of oil, $12.79 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.06 per Mcf of gas. Should prices decline in future periods, reserves may be revised downward for quantities which may be uneconomical to produce at lower prices.
The Company's 1997 reserve replacement rate on a BOE basis was 1450%, which included reserve replacement rates for oil and natural gas of 1375% and 1528%, respectively. Previous reserve replacement performance rates were 314% in 1996 (398% for oil and 239% for gas) and 281% in 1995 (263% for oil and 297% for gas). For the three year period ended December 31, 1997, the average reserve replacement rate was 769%, as compared to a three year average replacement rate of 377% in 1996 and 412% in 1995. During 1997, the Company's reserve replacement rate was primarily the product of its acquisition activities. In 1995, and to a greater extent in 1996, the reserve replacement rates were influenced more by exploration and development activities and less by acquisition activities.
Finding Cost
The Company's acquisition and finding cost for 1997 was $8.23 per BOE as compared to the 1996 and 1995 acquisition and finding costs of $3.10 and $2.87 per BOE, respectively. The increased rate in 1997 is a result of the fair value associated with Mesa's and Chauvco's long-lived, low production cost reserves. The average acquisition and finding cost for the three-year period from 1995 to 1997 was $7.04 per BOE representing a 76% increase from the 1996 three-year average rate of $3.99.
Oil and Gas Mix
The Company seeks to maintain a strategic balance between oil and natural gas reserves and production. While the Company's reserve and production mix may vary somewhat on a short-term basis as the Company takes advantage of market conditions and specific acquisition and development opportunities, management believes that a relative mix of approximately 50% oil and NGLs and 50% natural gas is in the best long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company's reserve mix was 50% oil and NGLs and 50% gas at December 31, 1997, and its production mix was 51% oil and NGLs and 49% gas during 1997.
Description of Properties
The Company manages its domestic oil and gas properties based upon their geographic area, and, as a result, the Company has divided its domestic operations into three domestic operating regions: the Permian Basin region, the onshore and offshore Gulf Coast region and the MidContinent region. In addition, at December 31, 1997, the Company has international operations principally in Argentina and Canada.
Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast region includes onshore oil and gas properties located in South and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf Coast region, the Company is focused on reserve and production growth through a balanced portfolio of development and exploration activities. To accomplish this, the Company has devoted most of its domestic exploration efforts to this region as well as its investment in and utilization of 3-D seismic technology.
Utilization of 3-D seismic technology during 1997 yielded substantial results in the Company's Lopeno field which produces from the Wilcox formation. Gross gas production from this area increased from 36 MMcf per day to 57 MMcf per day during 1997 as a result of drilling eight development wells, most of which were identified from 3-D seismic data. The Company has identified at least eight additional drilling locations after further interpretation of the 3-D data. In addition, the Company continues to experience successful results in its 100% owned Pawnee field which produces 21 MMcf per day from 23 wells in the Edwards formation. The Company has been actively developing this field with new drilling, horizontal recompletions, adding new perforations and acidizing existing wellbores which increased field production seven MMcf per day during 1997. A 3-D seismic survey will be utilized to identify additional drilling locations in this field area.
Cotton Valley. In May of 1997, the Company acquired a 35% interest in approximately 375,000 acres within the Cotton Valley Pinnacle Reef Trend from Union Pacific Resources Company ("UPRC") for $26.9 million. The Company and UPRC have signed an exploration agreement to jointly explore and develop this area located in eastern Texas.
On December 19, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of assets in the East Texas Basin from affiliates of American Cometra, Inc. ("ACI") and Rockland Pipe Co. ("Rockland"), both subsidiaries of Electrafina S.A. of Belgium. Purchase consideration consisted of $85 million cash and 1.6 million shares of Company common stock. The Company acquired all of ACI's producing wells, acreage (95,000 gross and 38,000 net), seismic data, royalties and mineral interests and Rockland's gathering system, pipeline and Plum Creek gas processing plant in the East Texas Basin. The acquired acreage is in Henderson, Freestone, Anderson and Leon counties. The acquired wells are currently producing approximately 18 MMcf of gas per day and have significant upside potential with the planned drilling of additional wells.
During 1998, the Company plans an aggressive drilling program in the Gulf Coast region with a total budget of $157.5 million to drill approximately 49 exploratory wells and 25 development wells. Exploration expenditures are estimated at $75 million and will be focused in the inland water transition zone areas of Louisiana and Texas and the Cotton Valley Pinnacle Reef Trend in East Texas. During 1998, the Company will focus development activities in five core properties: Lopeno and Pawnee fields in South Texas, Timbalier Bay and Grand Bay fields in South Louisiana and Eugene Island 208 field in the Gulf of Mexico.
MidContinent. The MidContinent region includes properties located in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas. By far, the largest of these assets is the Company's Hugoton field followed by the West Panhandle field, both acquired from Mesa in August 1997. These two fields combined account for approximately $1 billion of the Company's $3.1 billion of SEC 10 reserve value at December 31, 1997. During 1998, the Company plans to spend approximately $48.8 million in the MidContinent region. This activity includes drilling approximately 110 development wells and six exploratory wells and performing recompletions on approximately 26 targeted wells.
Hugoton Field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The Company's Hugoton properties represent approximately 13% of the proved reserves in the field and are located on over 237,000 net acres, covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interest in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, 977 of which it operates, and royalty interest in approximately 750 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and associated NGLs.
Production in the Hugoton field is subject to allowables set by state regulators, but the Company's Hugoton properties are capable of producing approximately 188 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing and before reduction for royalties). The Company estimates that it and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced at or near capacity in 1997. By continuing its successful installation of compression and artificial lift, in combination with an extensive stimulation program and a selective replacement well drilling program, the Company anticipates that the normal 8% Hugoton properties production decline may be temporarily arrested.
The Company intends to submit an application to the Kansas Corporation Commission (the "KCC") to allow infill drilling into the Council Grove Formation. The Company believes that such infill drilling could increase production from its Hugoton properties. There can be no assurance that the application will be approved or as to the timing of receipt of such approval if such approval is obtained.
West Panhandle Field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas where initial production commenced in 1918. These stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Company's natural gas in the West Panhandle field is produced from approximately 600 wells on more than 241,000 gross (185,000 net) acres covering over 375 square miles. The Company's wellhead gas produced from the West Panhandle field contains a high quantity of NGLs, yielding relatively greater NGL volumes than realized from other natural gas fields. The Company operates the wells and production equipment and Colorado Interstate Gas Company owns and operates the gathering system.
The production from the West Panhandle field is processed through the Company-owned Fain natural gas processing plant. In February 1997, the Company initiated a project to add nitrogen rejection capabilities at the Fain Plant. This project, which is scheduled for completion in mid-1998, will allow the Company to recover in excess of 90% of the helium in the processed gas, increase NGL recoveries and upgrade residue quality to improve marketing flexibility.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company's West Panhandle properties represented approximately 12% of the Company's equivalent proved reserves and approximately 12% of the present value of estimated future net cash flows, determined in accordance with SEC guidelines. The Company has identified over 50 locations that have additional production potential in new areas or deeper zones that the Company plans to redrill in 1998.
Permian Basin. Of the $931.3 million of SEC 10 value contained in the properties in the Permian Basin region, the Spraberry field accounts for $642.6 million. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average Btu content of 1,400 Btu per Mcf. The oil and gas is produced from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. The center of the Spraberry field was unitized in the late 1950's and early 1960's by the major oil companies but until the late 1980's experienced very limited development activity. Since 1989, the Company has focused acquisition and development drilling activities in the unitized portion of the Spraberry field due to the dormant condition of the properties and the high net revenue interests available. The Company believes the area offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas reserves because of the hundreds of undeveloped infill drilling locations and the ability to reduce operating expenses through economies of scale. In February 1997, the Texas Railroad Commission (which regulates oil and gas production) entered a favorable order on the Company's application to allow administrative approval of uncontested applications to increase the density of drilling in the Spraberry field from one well per 80 acres to one well in 40 acres. The Company believes such reduced spacing may provide in excess of 1,000 additional drilling locations which have the potential to add 70 million BOE's to the Company's reserve base. Through December 31, 1997, the Company has drilled 60 wells in the Spraberry field under the reduced spacing requirements resulting in the addition of approximately 6.9 million BOE's to its reserve portfolio.
Since the early 1960's, the Company has been involved in acquisition and development activities in other fields in the Permian region which includes all of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. The Iatan field in Mitchell County, Texas, the Lusk and Dagger Draw fields in Eddy County, New Mexico, the Abell (Devonian) field in Crane and Pecos Counties of Texas, the Ozona field in Crockett and Sutton Counties of Texas and the War-Wink West Field in the Delaware Basin of West Texas are core areas for the Company's Permian region operations in terms of existing production, production and reserve growth, and identification of additional drilling locations.
The Company will continue to focus on the development of the existing properties utilizing waterflood procedures and secondary recovery technologies as these efforts have consistently resulted in increased production, reserve additions due to development drilling, and new drilling locations. In addition, all of the fields in this operational group have been screened for feasibility for carbon dioxide (CO2) flood implementation, and the Company plans to move forward in utilizing this technology in 1998. In total, the Company anticipates spending $112.5 million in 1998 in the Permian Basin to drill approximately 295 wells and to perform recompletions on approximately 135 targeted wells. Development activities will account for 95% of these planned expenditures.
International. The acquisition of Chauvco provided the Company with a significant presence in Argentina and Canada, representing 11% and 8% of the Company's SEC 10 value at December 31, 1997. The Canadian producing properties are primarily located in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada in the following areas: Thompson/Alliance, Spirit River/Rycroft, Cherhill, Killam, Choice, David, Martin Creek and Chinchaga. During 1997, these properties produced an average of 17,532 BOE's per day, net to the Company's interest. These properties currently include more than 700 development drilling locations.
The Company's Argentine properties are primarily located in the Tierra del Fuego and Neuquen basins. Chauvco's share of Argentine production during 1997 averaged 16,147 BOE's per day. The Tierra del Fuego production concession is located in the extreme southern portion of Argentina, approximately 1,500 miles south of the country's capital, Buenos Aires. Crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs are produced from six separate fields in which the Company has a 35%
working interest. The most significant area is the San Sebastian field which accounts for approximately 40% of crude oil and condensate production, 100% of propane and butane production, and 84% of natural gas sales from the concession. In Argentina, recent expansion of gas processing facilities and completed pipeline connections at Tierra del Fuego will allow handling of increased production volumes committed for delivery under a gas contract to a petrochemical plant in Chile. Natural gas deliveries under the contract to the methanol plant in Chile commenced in January 1997 at a rate of 17.0 MMcf per day.
The Company's operated production in Argentina is concentrated in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest of the country's capital city and just to the east of the Andes Mountains. Crude oil and natural gas are produced from two separate fields in the Loma Negra/NI Block, the Huincul field in the Dadin Block and from three oil fields and one natural gas field in the Al Norte de la Dorsal Block in which the Company has a 100% working interest.
In addition to the proved producing assets of Chauvco, the Company acquired a substantial inventory of unproved oil and gas properties which will provide the Company with many exploration opportunities with the potential for significant reserve additions. Although the acquisition of a portfolio of unproved properties represents an exciting challenge to the Company's team of engineers, geologists and geophysicists, such opportunities are not without risk. U.S. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated value. These evaluations will be affected by results of exploration activities, future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of proved reserves determined by such evaluations are not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, the Company may be required to recognize significant noncash charges to the earnings of future periods. There can be no assurance that economic reserves will be determined to exist for such projects.
On a smaller scale, the Company has recently entered into agreements to begin exploratory activity in the African nations of South Africa and Gabon. The South African Block covers over five million acres along the southern coast of South Africa, generally in water depths less than 650 feet. It is located between Block 9, which produces quantities of oil from Oribi Field (up to 25,000 barrels per day) and gas from F-A Field (about 190 MMcf per day), and Pioneer's study block 13A/14A offshore Port Elizabeth. In addition, Pioneer concluded in November of 1997, a Technical Cooperation Agreement on Block 7 which is located adjacent to and west of Block 9, and covers an area of about three million acres, the most prospective portion of which is in water depths of less than 500 feet.
The Company plans to spend approximately $181.2 million internationally in 1998 as follows: $97.5 million in Argentina, $57.5 million in Canada, and $26.2 million in Africa and other international areas. The Company's international exploration budget of $50 million is primarily devoted to Africa, Argentina and Canada.
