FRANCHISED WENDY'S RESTAURANTS
As of December 29, 2002, the Company's franchisees operated 4,933 Wendy's restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 21 other countries and territories.
The rights and franchises under which most franchised restaurants in the United States are operated are set forth in one basic document, the Unit Franchise Agreement. This document gives the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy's restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy's and to use the Wendy's system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Unit Franchise Agreement provides for a 20 year term and a 10 year renewal subject to certain conditions.
Wendy's has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, now it is generally the intent of the Company to grant new Wendy's franchises on a unit-by-unit basis.
The Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a royalty of 4% of gross sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement typically requires that the franchisee pay the Company a technical assistance fee. In the United States, the technical assistance fee required under newly executed Unit Franchise Agreement is currently $25,000 for each restaurant.
The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the cost to the Company in providing technical assistance in the development of the Wendy's restaurant, initial training of franchisees or their operator and in providing other assistance associated with the opening of the Wendy's restaurant. In certain limited instances (like the regranting of franchise rights or the relocation of an existing restaurant), Wendy's may charge a reduced technical assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee. The Company does not select or employ personnel on behalf of the franchisees.
Wendy's currently offers to qualified franchisees, pursuant to its Franchise Real Estate Development program, the option of having Wendy's locate and secure real estate for new store development. Wendy's obtains all licenses and permits necessary to construct and operate the restaurant, with the franchisee having the option of building the restaurant or having Wendy's construct it. The franchisee pays Wendy's a fee for this service and reimburses Wendy's for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses Wendy's incurs in locating, securing, and/or constructing the new store.
The rights and franchises currently offered for international development are contained in the Franchise Agreement and Services Agreement (the Agreements) which are issued upon approval of a restaurant site. The Agreements are for an initial term of 10 years or the term of the lease for the restaurant site, whichever is shorter. The Agreements license the franchisee to use the Company's trademarks and know-how in the operation of the restaurant. Upon execution of the Agreements, the franchisee is required to pay a technical assistance fee. Generally, the technical assistance fee is $30,000 for each restaurant. Currently, the franchisee is required to pay monthly fees, usually 4%, based on the monthly gross sales of the restaurant, as defined in the Agreements.
See Schedule II on page 18 of this Form 10-K, and Management's Review and Outlook on pages AA-1 through AA-15 and Note 11 on pages AA-31 and AA-32 of the Financial Statements and Other Information furnished with the Company's 2003 Proxy Statement (Management's Review and Outlook and Note 11 are incorporated herein by reference) for further information regarding reserves, commitments and contingencies involving franchisees.
FRANCHISED HORTONS RESTAURANTS
Hortons franchisees operate under several types of license agreements. The typical term of a license agreement for a standard type of unit is 10 years plus aggregate renewal period(s) of approximately 10 years.
In Canada, for franchisees who lease land and/or buildings from Hortons, the license agreement generally requires between 3% and 4.5% of weekly gross sales of the restaurant, as defined in the license agreement, for royalties plus a monthly rental which is the greater of a base monthly rental payment or a percentage (usually 10%) rental payment based on monthly gross sales, as defined in the license agreement. Where the franchisee either owns the premises or leases it from a third party, the royalty required is increased by 1.5%. In the United States, for franchisees who lease land and/or buildings from Hortons, the license agreement generally requires 4.5% of weekly gross sales of the restaurant, as defined in the license agreement, for royalties plus a monthly rental which is the greater of a base monthly rental payment or a percentage (usually 8.5%) rental payment based on monthly gross sales, as defined in the license agreement.
Hortons generally retains the right to reacquire a franchisee's interest in a restaurant in the event the franchisee wants to sell its interest during the first five years of the term of the license agreement. After such period, Hortons generally retains a right of first refusal with regard to any proposed transfer of the franchisee's interest in the restaurant, together with the right to consent to any transfer to a new franchisee.
FRANCHISED BAJA FRESH RESTAURANTS
Each Baja Fresh area developer is required to enter into two types of agreements: an Area Development Agreement ("ADA") and a franchise agreement for each restaurant opened under the ADA. The ADA establishes the timing and number of stores to be developed in an area. Pursuant to the current ADA, a franchisee is required to pay a non-refundable $50,000 initial franchise fee for the first restaurant, and an initial development fee equal to $17,500 multiplied by the total number of restaurants required under the ADA (excluding the first restaurant). As each new site is accepted, the franchisee signs a franchise agreement and lease on the premises and pays an initial franchise fee of $35,000, $17,500 of which is paid in cash and $17,500 of which is paid by crediting a portion of the initial development fee paid by the franchisee. Other than this credit, the development fee is non-refundable.
The current ADA fixes royalties payable to the Company under each single restaurant franchise agreement to 5% of the franchisee's gross sales. For restaurants currently opened pursuant to older ADAs, lower initial franchise fees and royalty rates may apply (as low as a $20,000 initial franchise fee and 4% royalty rate for certain franchisees, including those who had entered into ADAs with the Company prior to fiscal year ended 1999).
The ADAs have an initial term equal to the number of years over which the franchisee is required to open restaurants, typically 5 years, but provides the franchisee with an opportunity to enter into a successor ADA subject to certain conditions. The single restaurant franchise agreements typically have a 10-year initial term, but provide the franchisee with an opportunity to enter into a two successive 5-year renewal franchise agreements subject to certain conditions.
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS
Products sold by Wendy's restaurants are advertised through television, radio, newspapers, the internet and a variety of promotional campaigns. The Company attempts to keep franchisees informed of current advertising techniques and effective promotions. The Company's advertising materials are also made available to the franchisees. Both the Restaurant Franchise Agreement (Wendy's previous form of franchise agreement) and the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement provide that franchisees will spend 4% of their gross sales, as defined in the applicable agreement, for advertising and promotions. The Restaurant Franchise Agreement and the Unit Franchise Agreement specify that 2% is to be spent on local and regional advertising (including in many cases cooperative advertising) and 2% is the required contribution to The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc. ("WNAP"). Under the Restaurant Franchise Agreement and the Unit Franchise Agreement, the Company has the ability to increase the required total advertising expenditure to 5% in certain instances. Also, under the Unit Franchise Agreement the Company may in certain circumstances change the allocation between local/regional and national advertising.
For the years 1993 through 2001, the domestic system approved the reallocation of the 4% advertising and promotions percentage, such that the 4% was reallocated as 2.5% toward national advertising and 1.5% toward local and regional advertising. For the years 2002 through 2006, the domestic system has approved the reallocation of the 4% advertising and promotions percentage, such that the 4% would be reallocated as 3% toward national advertising and 1% toward local and regional advertising.
In 2002, 2001 and 2000, approximately $207 million, $162 million and $152 million, respectively, was spent on advertising, promotions and related expenses by WNAP. WNAP is an Ohio not-for-profit corporation which was established to collect and administer the funds contributed by the Company and all domestic franchisees. WNAP's Trustees are comprised of representatives of both the Company and its franchisees.
Products sold by Wendy's Canada restaurants are advertised through television, radio and a variety of promotional campaigns. Wendy's Canadian Advertising Program Inc. ("WCAP") provides Wendy's Canada corporate and franchise restaurants (excluding Quebec, where all advertising in done locally) with in-store advertising and promotional materials. WCAP currently collects approximately 2.75% of monthly gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreement, from Wendy's Canada franchise and corporate restaurants (excluding Quebec) as contributions to this fund. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, approximately $11.0 million, $9.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, was spent by WCAP.
Products sold by Hortons restaurants are advertised through television, radio, newspapers and a variety of promotional campaigns. Hortons provides franchisees with in store advertising and promotional materials. Tim Hortons Canada is generally entitled to collect 4% of monthly gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreement, from franchisees as a contribution to the Tim Hortons Advertising and Promotion Fund (Canada) Inc. ("Ad Fund"). For the 2002 calendar year, the contribution percentage was voluntarily and temporarily reduced to 3.75% from January 1 through September 30, and further reduced to 3.5% from October 1 through the end of 2002. Tim Hortons U.S. collects 4% of monthly gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreement, from franchisees as a contribution to The Tim's National Advertising Program ("TNAP"). During 2002, 2001 and 2000, approximately $57 million, $51 million and $48 million, respectively, was spent by the Ad Fund and approximately $6.8 million, $5.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively, was spent by TNAP.
Products sold by Wendy's international restaurants outside of Canada are advertised through various media including television, radio, newspaper and a variety of promotional campaigns. Most international franchisees are required by their franchise agreement to spend at least 4% of the gross sales of their restaurants, as defined in the franchise agreement, on advertising and marketing. The Company assists its international franchisees in preparing and executing marketing plans and endeavors to keep its international franchisees informed of current advertising techniques and effective promotions.
Baja Fresh has the right to assess franchisees an advertising fee in the amount of 1% of gross sales, and to establish regions for cooperative advertising and require an additional advertising fee not to exceed 1.5% of gross sales. The Company has not made an assessment of either of these advertising fees to date.
See Note 13 on page AA-33 of the Financial Statements and Other Information furnished with the Company's 2003 Proxy Statement, which Note is incorporated herein by reference, for further information regarding advertising.
