Coteau Lake, Saskatchewan
In connection with the acquisition of Target Energy, we acquired certain working interest in Coteau Lake, Saskatchewan.
Coteau Lake is an exploration property and we have no producing oil or gas wells on this land at this time. The Coteau Lake exploration project covers 1,280 acres of land. Our gross and net interest in this project is 50%. There has been historic oil production on the Coteau Lake project lands.
On November 7, 2007, our subsidiary Target Energy entered into a Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Primrose Drilling Ventures Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta. Pursuant to the LOI, our subsidiary Target is the interest title holder of Saskatchewan Crown Land parcels 124, 125 and 126.
Primrose elected to proceed with a 50/50 joint venture with Target by reimbursing Target for 50% of its land cost on parcels 124, 125 and 126 for CAD$26,590 which was paid within 15 days of signing the LOI. Primrose would become operator of the project upon its acceptance of such appointment and agreement to assume the duties, obligations and rights of the operator. A formal Participation Agreement which included an Area of Mutual Interest which would govern future land acquisitions and timeline set out in the LOI. On December 31, 2008, an additional CAD$22,270 was spent on land acquisitions with Primrose Drilling Ventures.
On October 25, 2010, we disposed of the Coteau Lake interests for a cash consideration of $100,000 plus an additional potential payout which shall be based on a 10% profit interest on any and all productive wells drilled on the property up to $150,000. We did not take into consideration of the future potential payout as it cannot reasonably determinable as at August 31, 2012.
Belmont Lake
Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Cheetah Oil & Gas Ltd. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 40.432% of an 8% share of Cheetah’s net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Cheetah 57.76% of Cheetah’s costs currently budgeted at $77,905.36, subject to revision and 57.76% of Cheetah’s 8% share of PP-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Cheetah Oil & Gas Ltd, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah and 375,000 share purchase warrants which entitled our company to acquire 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah at a purchase price of US$0.20 per share for a period of two years.
Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Lexaria Corp. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 13.475% of a 32% share of Lexaria’s net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Lexaria 19.25% of Lexaria’s costs currently budgeted at $311,621.44, subject to revision and 19.25% of Lexaria’s 32% share of PP-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Lexaria Corp, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 499,893 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria and 499,983 share purchase warrants which entitle our company to acquire 499,983 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria at a purchase price of US$0.20 per share for a period of two years. On January 6, 2012, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with a third party (“Purchaser”). The Company has agreed to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser has agreed to purchase from the Company, 250,000 units of Lexaria Corp. at a purchase price of US$0.15 per unit, for a total of US$37,500, by the effective closing date of January 6, 2012. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Purchaser will have an option, at his sole discretion, to pay US$0.25 per unit or approximately US$62,500 to purchase the remaining 249,893 units on or before March 2, 2012. The Purchaser did not exercise the option to purchase the remaining 249,893 units. On July 30, 2012, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with the President of the Company, Robert McAllister. The Company agreed to sell Mr. Robert McAllister, and Robert McAllister has agreed to purchase from the Company, 249,893 shares of Lexaria Corp. at a purchase price of US$0.075 per share, for a total of US$18,741. As a result, as of August 31, 2012 we now own zero shares of Lexaria Corp.

Copper Hills project is located approximately 8 miles west on HWY 60 from Magdalena, NM. HWY 60 actually crosses the property. Access south of the hwy is by dirt or gravel roads. Access north of the hwy is through locked ranch gate. The property is located within the physiographic province known as the Datil-Mogollon Section, locally characterized by volcanic highlands.
The geology of the project area was described by Wilkinson (1976). A northerly trending fault separates volcanic rocks to the west from younger piedmont gravels, alluvium and basalt to the east. Volcanic rocks are dominantly Oligocene ‘Spears Formation’ andesitic volcaniclastics. The important ‘Nipple Mountain’ tuff member is an interbedded lithic and variably welded tuff with deposition controlled by northeast and east-northeast trending, partly fault bounded paleovalleys. The overlying ‘Hells Mesa Formation’ and the ‘A-L Peak Tuff’ represents a change to ash flow volcanism related to the Mt. Withington caldera collapse. The caldera margin is situated 7 ½ km south of the Copper Hills prospect.
Structurally the property is situated within a north-northwest trending uplifted block bounded to the east by the ‘Mulligan Gulch’ graben. Three major structural trends are present at Copper Hills. The west-northwest trending ‘Capitan’ lineament is a pre-volcanic feature that was reactivated in the Oligocene. The northeast to east-northeast trending ‘Morenci-Magdalena’ lineament is also a basement feature that in part controlled deposition of the Nipple Mountain tuff. The north to 335° trend reflects the monoclinal eastern edge of the uplifted block and controlled the emplacement of intrusive stocks and later Basin and Range faulting. Convergence of the three structural trends in the vicinity of the Copper Hills prospect resulted in an intense shattering of the rocks.
Mineralization at Copper Hills includes fracture controlled and disseminated copper oxides (plus silver) at the Copper Hills prospect and epithermal gold-silver veins. Wilkinson (1976) describes previous work conducted on the property. Various stakeholders held mining claims in the area almost continuously between 1950 and 2007. During the 1950’s minor copper oxide production from the Copper Hills main outcrop took place and five short holes were drilled. In 1968 the Banner Mining Company reportedly drilled a deeper hole to 1,622 ft (494.5 m) and intersected pervasive propylitic alteration with abundant fresh and oxidized pyrite throughout the hole. Samples taken from the last 100 ft reportedly contained small amounts of pyrite plus chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena. Numerous other prospecting pits and shafts are found on the property and most appear to be related to exploration and minor extraction of minerals associated with epithermal vein type systems. The Banner hole is on the eastern edge of a strong IP-chargeability anomaly defined by the IP survey completed by Wright geophysics in August, 2011.
The most recent exploration work done at Copper Hills was by Coyote Copper in the early part of 2008 which included a ground magnetics geophysical survey, followed by a reconnaissance and field verification mapping and rock chip sampling program and a soil sampling geochemical survey. Enertopia engaged Wright geophysical to manage an IP geophysical survey conducted in August, 2011. Wright also interpreted the results and provided a technical report.
In the Fall of 2011 IP/Res Survey was completed and returned sulphide targets at depth that have been recommended for drilling.
The total costs incurred to date and all planned future costs are as follows:
Exploration costs incurred by Enertopia to date ~ $140,000
Future exploration plans involve a two phase drill program described below:
A two phase exploration program:
Phase 1 would commence with 3 core drill holes to an average depth of 550 meters designed to test the strong IP-chargeability anomalies defined by the geophysical survey completed in August, 2011. In addition, reverse circulation drilling will be undertaken to verify the grade and extent of the copper (+silver) mineralization as documented by previous operators, within and peripheral to the Copper Hills Prospect. This is will require about 750 m of drilling in 10 reverse circulation holes each about 75 m in depth spaced on a 50 m x 50 m grid. The total Phase 1 program will cost of $720,000.
Contingent upon Phase 1 providing positive results it is recommended for Phase 2 that additional drilling be undertaken to add to the grade and extent of the copper (+silver) mineralization as documented by previous operators, within and peripheral to the Copper Hills Prospect. This is will require about 1,500 m of drilling in 20 reverse circulation holes each about 75 m in depth designed to extend the a 50 m x 50 m grid.
An additional 2,500 m of core drilling is recommended to offset the two core holes into the IP anomaly. Other facets of a Phase 2 program include conducting additional geological mapping, prospecting and sampling of priority targets based on geophysical and geochemical survey interpretations. The cost of Phase 2 will be about $1,210,000. The total for both phases is US$1,930,000.
The property is without known reserves and the program is exploratory in nature.
Results from the ground IP survey show a strong chargeability anomaly to the east of the Tres Montosas fault. The anomaly is about 500 meters wide east-west and about 1,000 meters long north-south. Wright concludes that the chargeability anomaly may be related to “pyritic alteration”. The IP anomaly is coincident with the presence of oxidized pyrite and copper at the surface along with quartz veining, silicification and strongly anomalous base metal anomalies along north-trending structures. These features are permissive of a porphyry-style hydrothermal system.
The exploration program would be funded through equity financing or a joint venture. The proposed work is dependant whether on the type of financing or joint venture that the company completes.
The required permits include BLM notice level application for an area of disturbance estimated to be less than 5 acres. Location map of drill locations and road or routes for vehicle traffic. The State of New Mexico also requires a minimal impact exploration permit application to be filed at the same time as the BLM notice level application is filed.
Mildred Peak Project, Arizona
On July 19, 2011, the Company entered into a letter of intent and paid US$15,000 deposit to Altar Resources. Subsequent to August 31, 2011, on October 11, 2011, the Company signed a Mineral Purchase Option Agreement with Altar Resources with respect to an option to earn 100% interest, subject to a 2.5% NSR in a property known as Mildred Peak. The mining claims are in Arizona covering approximately 7,148 acres from Altar Resources which holds the mining claims directly and indirectly through federal mining claims and state mineral exploration leases; or, represented that it would hold such claims in good standing at the time of closing a definitive agreement.

Mildred Peak is located on BLM land and State lands as such mineral and surface rights are held by the BLM and Arizona State. Enertopia has acquired an option of 57 located mining claims.
There are 57 federal located unpatented mining claims.
There are 12 State mineral exploration permits.
These mining claims and mining permits are valid for one year and need to be renewed annually at the rate of $140 per BLM mining claim on or before August 31st and $500 per Arizona State exploration mining permit on or before the anniversary payment date. The State of Arizona also has a yearly per acre exploration fee of $10 per acre in years one and two and $20 per acre in years 3-5.
The Mildred Peak Property is located in the Baboquivari Mountains of southern Arizona, approximately 65 miles southwest of Tucson, AZ and 15 miles (23 km) north of the USA/Mexico border. The Mildred Peak Property comprises approximately 7,148 acres and consists of 12 state mineral exploration permits 6,015 acres and 57 federal mining claims 1,133 acres.
The Company also has a right of first refusal (ROFR) on an additional two state mineral exploration permits and three federal mining claims covering approximately 1,240 acres.
The Mildred Peak area was historically the site of two gold mines; the Gold Bullion and Jupiter mines which are situated inside the ROFR lands, as well as the numerous smaller mines, including the Iowana mine. Subsequent drilling, sampling and trenching by numerous companies revealed the potential for the property to host a gold deposit(s). Previous exploration by others resulted in the discovery of up to 67.43 grams gold per tonne (g Au/t) at or near the south zone and 40.65 g Au/t at or near the north zone from surface rock samples.
Mildred Peak is situated in the Baboquivari Mountains region contains sedimentary, volcanic and intrusiverocks that were originally part of a Jurassic continental magmatic arc (Lajack, 1994).These rocks were then subjected to a Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary episode of metamorphism and thrusting (Haxel et al., 1980). The Mildred Peak area, along the most of the Baboquivari Mountains make up the lower plate of the Baboquivari thrust.
The northern and southern portion of the Mildred Peak prospect is underlain by a northeast-striking, altered early Jurassic metaconglomerate unit. Immediately south of the Shaffer Canyon fault, which trends northeast, the Jurassic metaconglomerate is overlain by metasiltstone and argillite, which in turn is overlain by Jurassic volcanic rocks (Somerville, 2002). All units were hydrothermally altered and intruded by prominent rhyolite dikes in the mid-Tertiary.
Previous work conducted at or near the Mildred Peak Property indicates that mineralization is dominantly hosted within a thick, shallow dipping Jurassic metaconglomerate unit throughout the property. To a lesser extent, mineralization has also been recognized in mid-Tertiary felsic bodies that intruded the metaconglomerate unit. The style of mineralization reported to date indicates that potential exists for epithermal Bonanza type vein hosted high grade precious metal deposits as well as more disseminated fine grained lower grade Carlin type precious metal deposits (Berger and Bethke, eds., 1985). The presence of lower grade gold occurrences associated within quartz veins in the argillite-greenstone unit near Mildred Peak also indicate that there is also potential for shear hosted mesothermal gold deposits.
The gold mineralization at the Mildred Peak Property is found within two diverse geologic settings. First, around Jupiter Canyon-Weaver Canyon in the northern region and the Arroyo del Puente area in the southern region of the prospect area, extensive silicification and pyritization affected Early Jurassic metaconglomerate and intrusive porphyry (Lajack, 1994). Anomalous amounts of gold are found throughout the silicified area and most significantly within the metaconglomerates. These are the rocks that have produced the majority of gold in the past and have been the subject of exploration more recently. The cross-cutting (approximately E-W striking) mid-Tertiary dikes and quartz veins are associated with the highest concentrations of gold, including the Gold Bullion and Jupiter mines. Mineralization of silicified areas occurred during the mid- Tertiary and may be associated with (1) rhyolite intrusion, (2) remobilization of early Jurassic stratabound epigenetic mineralization, or (3) remobilization of early Jurassic syngenetic, stratabound mineralization (Lajack, 1994). This precious metal mineralization is most likely the results of high level hydrothermal processes.
The relatively limited amount of reconnaissance sampling/exploration demonstrates that numerous bedrock sources for gold mineralization exist within the Mildred Peak Property and verifies the findings of others. Based on the positive results to date, the character of the property is of sufficient merit to justify further exploration.
Exploration should include (but not be limited to) an aggressive staged exploration program.
The exploration program would be funded through equity financing or a joint venture. The proposed work is dependant whether on the type of financing or joint venture that the company completes.
The required permits include BLM notice level application for an area of disturbance estimated to be less than 5 acres. Location map of drill locations and road or routes for vehicle traffic. The State of Arizona also requires a minimal impact exploration permit application to be filed at the same time as the BLM notice level application is filed.
