Item 2:
Description of Property
General Background
Since our inception in late August 2000, we have begun to build a solid asset base and achieved steady growth, primarily through property acquisitions, but with some exploitation activities. From our inception through December 31, 2005, our proved reserves have grown to 30,197,536 Boe, at an average acquisition/drilling cost of $2.21 per Boe. Many properties contain both oil and gas reserves. In those cases, the oil and gas reserves and the volume of oil and gas produced are converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of their approximate relative energy content. The common unit which we use is “Barrels of oil equivalent” or “Boe.” Acquisition and drilling costs “per Boe” is calculated by dividing the net capitalized costs ($66,748,047), computed in accordance with applicable accounting standards, as shown under “Capitalized Costs Relating to Oil and Gas Producing Activities” under Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities, by our reserves in Boe (30,197,536).
As of December 31, 2005, our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax PV10 value of approximately $683 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows of approximately $446 million, approximately 31% of which came from properties located in New Mexico, approximately 56% from our properties in Texas, approximately 9% from our properties in Oklahoma and approximately 4% from our properties in Kansas. We spent approximately $64 million on capital projects during 2003, 2004 and 2005. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling. Our capital budget for 2006 is approximately $61 million for development of existing properties. Although our focus will be on development of our existing properties, we also intend to continue seeking acquisition opportunities which compliment our current portfolio. We intend to fund our development activity primarily through use of cash flow from operations and cash on hand, while potential drawings on our credit facility and proceeds from future equity transactions would also be available for development projects or future acquisitions. We believe that our acquisition expertise, together with our operating experience and efficient cost structure, provides us with the potential to continue our growth.
The following table summarizes our total net proved reserves, pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows as of December 31, 2005.
Proved Reserves
Our 30,197,536 Boe of proved reserves, which consist of approximately 82% oil and 18% natural gas, are summarized below as of December 31, 2005, on a net pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows basis. Our reserve estimates have not been filed with any Federal authority or agency (other than the SEC).
As of December 31, 2005, New Mexico proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $216.5 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $136.6 million, our proved reserves in Texas had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $380.4 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $251.5 million, our proved reserves in Oklahoma had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $62.3 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $41.7 million and our proved reserves in Kansas had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $23.9 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $15.8 million.
As of December 31, 2005, approximately 26% of the 30.2 million Boe of proved reserves have been classified as proved developed producing, or “PDP”. Proved developed non-producing, or “PDNP” reserves constitute approximately 4%, proved developed behind-pipe “PDBP” reserves constitute approximately 8% and proved undeveloped, or “PUD”, reserves constitute approximately 62%, of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2005.
Approximately thirty-eight percent (38%) of our reserves for the year ended December 31, 2005 are associated with secondary recovery projects that are either in the initial stage of implementation or are scheduled for implementation. We anticipate that secondary recovery will be attempted by the use of waterflood of these reserves, and the exact project initiation dates and, by the very nature of waterflood operations, the exact completion dates of such projects, are uncertain.
Total proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value as of December 31, 2005 of approximately $683 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $446 million, 25.8% or $145.5 million and $94.5, respectively, of which is associated with the PDP reserves. An additional $39.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively, is associated with the PDNP reserves and $53.1 million and $34.9 million, respectively, is associated with PDBP reserves ($237.8 million and $155.3 million, respectively, for total proved developed reserves, or 38.5% of total proved reserves’ pre-tax PV10 value). The remaining $445.2 million and $290.4 million, respectively, is associated with PUD reserves.
Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2005 are summarized in the table below.

Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Significant New Mexico Operations
East Hobbs Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. In May 2004 we acquired a 82.24% working interest and a 67.6% net revenue interest in this lease primarily from EnerQuest Oil and Gas, Ltd., an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $10,008,440. “Net revenue interest” is the owner’s percentage share of the monthly income realized from the sale of a well’s produced oil and gas. The net revenue interest is a lesser number as compared to the working interest, due to the mineral owner royalty and other overriding royalties on the well. Although the Purchase and Sales Agreement transferred the revenue and the related operating costs from East Hobbs to us beginning March 1, 2004, Arena did not control the property interests until May 7, 2004. As a result, the acquisition date for accounting purposes was May 7, 2004 and the operations of East Hobbs’ operations were included in our results of operations from May 7, 2004. Revenues and operating costs for the months of March and April were estimated and treated as adjustments to the purchase price. This lease covers approximately 920 acres. There are currently 28 producing wells. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, four of which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease is held by production.
Seven Rivers Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. We acquired a 70.6% working interest and a 56.48% net revenue interest in this property in May 2003. This lease was acquired from Permian Resources Holding, Inc., an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $900,000. The remaining working interest is owned by unaffiliated parties. There are currently 40 producing wells on this lease. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, six of which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease consists of approximately 2,240 acres and is held by production.
North Benson Queen Unit - Eddy County, New Mexico. In October 2003 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 78.15% net revenue interest in this lease, which currently has 22 producing wells. This lease was acquired from United Resources, L.P., an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $500,000. The lease covers approximately 1,800 acres, and we believe this property can support a number of additional wells, 23 of which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease is held by production.
The North Benson Queen Unit Waterflood will require additional volumes of water to support the waterflood expansion. A sufficient and economical source of water has been identified and contracted for. A water line of approximately four miles in length will be constructed across Bureau of Land Management lands to transport the water to the North Benson Queen Unit. Permit applications have been submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and we are awaiting final approval. The construction of the water line should require approximately thirty days at a cost of $250,000. The development of the North Benson Queen Unit waterflood is scheduled for 2006 at estimated costs of $4,800,000.
Significant Texas Operations
Fuhrman-Mascho leases - Andrews County, Texas. In December 2004 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 75% net revenue interest in these leases from four entities; Paul D. Friemel & Assoc, Inc., Compostella Oil Company, Redco Oil & Gas Inc. and Terry N. Stevens, Inc., all unaffiliated companies. The purchase price, including acquisition costs, was $10,966,495 and consisted of $9,667,381 of cash paid to the sellers, $44,421 in cash acquisition costs, 179,658 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $1,260,091, or $7.00 per share, and the issuance of put and call options with a net value of $24,602. These leases cover approximately 11,300 acres. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, 147 of which are included in our estimate of PUD. These leases are held by production.
Y6 Lease - Fisher County, Texas. We acquired a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in this lease in June 2001. This lease was acquired from Durango Operating Company, Inc. an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $750,000. There are currently 12 producing wells on this lease. A portion of this property has been waterflooded, and when we begin our future development operations on this property, we plan to waterflood the remaining acreage. A waterflood operation is a method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil. The water from injection wells physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells. This potential waterflood project (and the estimated $1,050,000 cost thereof) is included as PUD in our reserve report. This lease consists of approximately 1,697 acres and is held by production.
West San Andres Unit - Yoakum County, Texas. In October 2003 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 79.60% net revenue interest in this lease from Permian Resources, Inc. an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $500,000. The lease covers approximately 1,200 acres, and currently has 12 producing wells. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, four of which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease is held by production.
Dodson Lease - Montague County, Texas. We purchased a 100% working interest and an 81.25% net revenue interest in this lease in June 2002. This lease was acquired from Nocona minerals Partnership, an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $200,000. There are currently three producing wells and nine other wells on this approximately 570 acre lease, all of which is held by production.
Significant Oklahoma Operations
Ona Morrow Sand Unit - Cimarron and Texas Counties, Oklahoma. We own a 100% working interest and an 81.32% net revenue interest in this lease which has been producing since our acquisition in July 2002. This lease was acquired from Bass Petroleum, Inc., an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $735,000. This lease has approximately 2,120 acres and 11 producing wells. We believe this property could support a number of additional wells, to of which are included in our estimate of our PUD. This lease is held by production.
Eva South Morrow Sand Unit - Texas County, Oklahoma. We own a 100% working interest and an 85.41% net revenue interest in this lease which was also acquired in July 2002. This lease was acquired from Ensign Operating Company, an unaffiliated company, for a cash payment of $827,500. The lease consists of approximately 489 acres and has seven producing wells. We believe this property could support a number of additional wells, two of which have been included in our estimate of our PUD. This lease is held by production.
Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz and Hanes Leases - Cimarron County, Oklahoma. We own 100% of the working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in these four leases acquired in September 2002. All have been producing leases since the date of our acquisition. The Midwell Appleby and Smaltz leases consist of approximately 1,640 acres with six producing wells, and we believe there are up to three additional drilling locations on these leases. The Hanes lease contains approximately 640 acres and two producing wells. We believe this property could support a number of additional wells, three of which are included in our estimate of PUD. All of these leases are held by production.
Roy Hanes Lease - Texas County, Oklahoma. We own a 24.5% working interest and a 21.44% net revenue interest in this lease, which is a property operated by XTO Energy, Inc, an unaffiliated company, who also owns the remaining working interest. The interest in this lease was acquired at the same time we acquired our interests in the Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz and Hanes leases, and there has been production on this lease since that time. This lease consists of approximately 640 acres, and is currently held by production.
The Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz, Hanes and Roy Hanes leases were acquired from Burk Royalty Co., Ltd., R.A. Kimball Property Co., Ltd. and Kimball Family Resources, Ltd., all unaffiliated companies. The cost of these leases was $550,179, with $100,000 paid in cash and the balance paid through our issuance of 99,885 shares of our common stock valued at $4.00 per share (the then current market value), and the issuance of put and call options with a net value to the sellers of $50,639.
Significant Kansas Operations
Koehn/Rexford Unit - Haskell & Gray County, Kansas. This lease consists of approximately 640 acres. After entering into a farmout agreement with Bird Creek Resources, Inc., an unaffiliated company, we drilled and completed an initial gas well on this lease. Under the terms of this agreement, we agreed to drill one well and could drill additional wells on the property. In exchange for each well drilled, we will be assigned 100% of the working interest (80% of the net revenue interest) in the well and related oil and gas until payout of all costs of drilling, equipping and operating the well. After payout, our working interest in the wells and related oil and gas will decrease to 75% (60% of the net revenue interest).
In 2002, we successfully drilled one well at a cost of approximately $153,000 to drill, complete and connect to the pipeline and thus will have reached payout when we recover this amount from production. After payout, Bird Creek Resources, Inc. will own the remaining 25% working interest.
On March 20, 2002, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Petro Consultants, Inc., to drill and operate the well on the above-mentioned property. Under the terms of the agreement, Petro purchased 27% of the working interest in the well for $88,200. On May 20, 2002, after the well was successfully drilled, we issued 70,000 shares of common stock (valued at $1.26 per share) to Petro to repurchase the 27% working interest in the well.
In February 2004, we successfully drilled one additional well on this acreage at a cost of approximately $159,000 to drill, complete and connect to the pipeline and thus will have reached payout when we recover this amount from production. After payout, Bird Creek Resources, Inc. will own the remaining 25% working interest.
In November 2004, we completed the installation of a pipeline from our Koehn lease to a gatherer/purchased pipeline. Total cost on installation of the pipeline was approximately $144,000. The installation of this pipeline was necessary to be able to begin producing from our wells in that area. Production started on December 11, 2004.
Schmidt Unit - Gray County, Kansas. During 2004 we leased an additional 640 acres offsetting our Koehn/Rexford Unit for a total of approximately $8,582. In November 2004, we successfully drilled one well on this acreage at a cost of approximately $183,520 to drill, complete and connect to the pipeline. We began producing from this well on December 23, 2004.
Beals Prospect - Comanche County, Kansas. In July 2003 we acquired a 100% working interest and an 80.5% net revenue interest in this lease, consisting of 1,560 acres. This lease was acquired from Bengalia Land and Cattle Company, an unaffiliated party, for a cash payment of $60,000. These leases will expire in April 2006; however, the Company is in the process of extending the leases an additional year.
Syracuse Prospect - Hamilton County, Kansas. During 2005 we leased 15,680 acres for a total of approximately $433,134. These leases provide us a 100% working interest and an 81% net revenue interest. During 2005, we drilled two wells, both of which are still under analysis and are being considered for completion. Additionally, we sold 41.25% of the working interest in these wells, for total proceeds of $340,000.
Rocky Prospect - Comanche County, Kansas. During 2005 we leased 4,160 acres for a total of approximately $141,412. These leases provide us a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest. During 2005, we drilled two wells on this property. One well was completed and put into production in December 2005. We sold a 41.25% working interest in this well for total proceeds of $170,000. The second well was drilled successfully but was pending completion at December 31, 2005. We sold a 50% working interest in this well for proceeds of $215,000, plus a commitment to pay a determined amount if the well was successful, dependant upon what zone or zones the well was to be completed in.
Acreage
The following table summarizes gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2005 by region (net acreage is our percentage ownership of gross acreage). Acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded.
Production History
The following table presents the historical information about our produced natural gas and oil volumes.
The average oil sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold, in Bbl. The average gas sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold, in Mcf. The total average sales price amounts are calculated by dividing total revenues by total volume sold, in Boe. The average production costs above are calculated by dividing production costs by total production in Boe.
Productive Wells
The following table presents our ownership at December 31, 2005, in productive oil and natural gas wells by region (a net well is our percentage ownership of a gross well).
Drilling Activity
During 2005 we completed the drilling of forty-six wells. Thirty-six wells were drilled on our Fuhrman Mascho properties in Andrews County, Texas. Six of the wells were drilled in Kansas, two in Gray County, Kansas, offsetting our existing wells there and four in Hamilton and Greeley County, Kansas on acreage acquired during 2005. The four wells in Hamilton and Greeley Counties were exploratory wells. Three wells were drilled on our East Hobbs property in Lea County, New Mexico. One well was drilled on our Eva South property in Texas County, Oklahoma.
Cost Information
We conduct our oil and natural gas activities entirely in the United States. As noted previously in the table appearing under “Production History”, our average production costs, per Boe, were $8.92 in 2003, $8.85 in 2004 and $7.54 in 2005. These amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs by our total volume sold, in Boe.
Costs incurred for property acquisition, exploration and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are shown below.
(1) The amount shown for 2005 for acquisition of unproved properties is net of proceeds received for partial working interests sold in wells drilled in Kansas.
Reserve Quantity Information
Our estimates of proved reserves and related valuations were based on reports prepared by Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc., independent petroleum and geological engineers, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities.” The estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors.
Our oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States. A summary of the changes in quantities of proved (developed and undeveloped) oil and natural gas reserves is shown below.
Our proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the standardized measure as described below were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69. Future cash inflows were computed by applying year-end prices to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in producing and developing the proved oil and natural gas reserves at year end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of properties involved. Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences, tax credits and loss carryforwards relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10 percent annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value or the present value of our oil and natural gas properties.
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
The changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Management’s Business Strategy Related to Properties
Our goal is to increase stockholder value by investing in oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on capital employed. We plan to achieve this goal by exploiting and developing our existing oil and natural gas properties and pursuing acquisitions of additional properties. Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following:
Developing and Exploiting Existing Properties. We believe that there is significant value to be created by drilling the identified undeveloped opportunities on our properties. We own interests in a total of 29,696 gross (22,174 net) developed acres and operate essentially all of the net pre-tax PV10 value of our proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we owned interests in approximately 20,600 gross undeveloped acres (16,645 net). We believe that our current and future cash flow will enable us to undertake the exploitation of our properties through additional drilling activities. Our expected capital budget for development of existing properties in 2006 is approximately $61 million.
Pursuing Profitable Acquisitions. We have historically pursued acquisitions of properties that we believe to have exploitation and development potential comparable to our existing inventory of drilling locations. We have developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing core properties. We have an experienced team of management and engineering professionals who identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. While our emphasis in 2006 and beyond is anticipated to focus on the further development of our existing properties, we will continue to look for properties with both existing cash flow from production and future development potential.
Controlling Costs through Efficient Operation of Existing Properties. We operate essentially 100% of the pre-tax PV10 value of our total proved reserves, which we believe enables us to better manage expenses, capital allocation and the decision-making processes related to our exploitation and exploration activities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our oil and gas production costs per Boe averaged $7.54 and general and administrative costs averaged $2.69 per Boe produced.
Other Properties and Commitments
We currently lease our principal executive offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At December 31, 2005, the lease was for approximately 3,224 square feet of office space, at an annual rental of $30,000. This lease is set to expire at December 31, 2006. The current facilities are believed adequate for our current operations.
