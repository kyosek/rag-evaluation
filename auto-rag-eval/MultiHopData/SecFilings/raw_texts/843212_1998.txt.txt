HISTORY OF PROPERTIES
The Company has emerged from the development stage and in addition to accumulating an inventory of oil and gas properties for future recovery, has begun to drill selected developmental wells on the properties which it holds. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, the Company acquired Simmons Oil Company, Inc. ("Simmons") through a business combination accounted for as a purchase. Simmons owns certain oil and gas properties that had been acquired prior to the acquisition of Simmons by the Company. The Company intends to further evaluate these properties and develop those which merit such efforts, based upon this continuing evaluation. Many of these properties contain existing wells that are not currently productive and which cannot be expected to become productive, if at all, without additional evaluation, work and repair. The Company has begun an extensive workover program with
the purpose of revitalizing these fields. At June 30, 1998, the workover and development program, while commenced, has not progressed to the point of substantial completion. Therefore, oil and gas production and related revenue from these workover properties are relatively minimal and proven reserves have not been allocated to these properties. In some instances, these wells are being plugged and abandoned in favor of more potentially productive properties in the Company's core areas of development.
The Company acquired Hycarbex, Inc. in a business combination accounted for as a purchase in April, 1995 and changed the name to Hycarbex-American Energy, Inc. ("Hycarbex") Hycarbex is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Hycarbex holds an Exploration License granted by the government of Pakistan to explore for oil and gas reserves in a particular Concession now comprised of approximately 4,000 square kilometers. The Company shot 256 kilometers of 2D seismic surveys across this Concession, drilled its initial exploratory well on the Concession in early 1998, and is currently preparing to drill the second exploratory well in late 1998. While the prospects of economic productivity have been evaluated by independent consultants to the Company whose report to management indicates certain Probable Recoverable Reserves and additional potential test drillsites, there can be no definitive evaluation of the potential value of this project until additional drilling and testing is completed.
In June, 1997, the Company acquired oil and gas properties totaling approximately 1,400 acres located in the Blue Ridge, Boling, and Manvel Fields, Fort Bend County, Texas. The acquisition included 82 producing and non-producing wells and all associated production equipment on the properties. The purchase price was $1,000,000 payable in a combination of cash and production payments over a maximum of four years. The Company paid $75,000 as down payment and executed a Note for $925,000. Under the terms of the purchase, the Company is committed to pay a minimum of $250,000 per year for the next four years, or until a total of $1,000,000 has been paid, whichever occurs first, through a combination of payments of $10,000 for each new drillsite that is drilled and payments to the seller in the form of an overriding royalty interest from gross production. During the fiscal year, the Company commenced its program to drill new wells on the properties acquired and to rework some of the previously existing wells.
A summary of the oil and gas properties areas in which the Company owns an interest are as follows:
FORT BEND COUNTY, TEXAS.
The Company owns interests in the Blue Ridge and Boling oil fields with 11 leases comprising approximately 1846 gross acres and 1729 net acres.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, the Company drilled six developmental wells in the Boling Field, with five of the six currently in various stages of completion or production. The Company has a significant number of proved undeveloped locations which it plans to drill in the Boling and Blue Ridge Fields.
Subsequent to June 30, 1998, the Company drilled two additional developmental wells in the
Boling field, with both currently in various stages of completion and production. The Company intends to drill a significant number of additional developmental wells in this field, pending the ultimate outcome of the initial eight tests.
LIBERTY COUNTY, TEXAS.
The Company previously held interests in the North Dayton oil field with nine wells previously drilled by other operators located on approximately 211 acres. Subsequent to June 30, 1997, the Company relinquished 161 acres of these properties, and has drilled 5 new wells in this field on the remaining 50 acres all of which are currently shut in, . The Company is in the process of evaluating the economic potential of these wells as they are completed and tested, and reviewing the viability of prospective recompletions of the old wells on this property.
GALVESTON COUNTY, TEXAS.
The Company previously held interests in the Dickinson and Gillock fields with leases comprising approximately 220 acres. The Company relinquished its interest in the Dickinson field and added the acquisition of an additional lease in the Gillock field comprised of 673 acres. The Company also sold one lease in the Gillock field. The remaining holdings of the Company are currently comprised of 673 net acres in the Gillock field.
JACOBABAD, PAKISTAN.
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Hycarbex-American Energy, Inc., obtained an Exploration License from the government of Pakistan to explore for oil and gas reserves . The Concession is located in the Middle Indus Basin, near the city of Jacobabad, Pakistan. The prospect covers 4,000 square kilometers (approximately 1 million acres ). The Company is currently studying all phases of this project in order to adopt a plan that will maximize the financial return from the Concession. Preparations for the drilling of the second exploratory well by the Company in late 1998 are currently underway.
A. DRILLING HISTORY
Set forth below is a tabulation of wells completed in the period indicated in which the Company has participated and the results thereof for each of the three years ended June 30, 1998.

D. PRODUCTION AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS
As of June 30, 1997 and 1998, the Company received oil revenues from 10 and 14 wells, respectively. All of these wells are oil producers, with no sales of gas. The additional productive wells identified herein are in various stages of recompletion. Many have begun or are expected to begin to generate production subsequent to June 30, 1998, which production is not reflected in the following production numbers:
1996 (FN 1) 1997 1998 ----------- ------- ---------- Net Oil Sales (Bbls) in the Fiscal Year ended June 30: ............. N/A 14,241 42,663 =========== ======= ========== Avg. Price per Barrel: ................. N/A $ 19.90 $ 15.03 =========== ======= ==========
- ----------------------
FN 1 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, the Company had de minimis sales of oil and gas which consisted only of production from preliminary testing of wells.
All wells in the U.S. fields were shut in for repairs and maintenance as of June 30, 1998, and had been shut in for varying periods of time prior to June 30, 1998, thereby reducing the amount of net sales by the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998.

FN 1 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, the Company had de minimis sales of oil and gas which consisted only of oil production from preliminary testing of wells.
FN 2 The Company does not presently produce natural gas.
E. OIL AND GAS RESERVES
The Company did not report reserves to any other agency of the U. S. government.
The Company's proved reserves and PV-10 Value from its U.S. proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties have been estimated by Sigma Energy Corporation in Houston, Texas. The Company's Pakistan Probable Recoverable Reserves and PV-10 Value from its Pakistan undeveloped gas properties have been estimated by Martin Petroleum and Associates in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The estimates of these independent petroleum engineering firms were based upon review of production histories and other geologic economic, ownership and engineering data provided by the Company. In accordance with SEC guidelines, the Company's estimates of future net revenue from the Company's proved and probable reserves and the present value thereof are made on the basis of oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment. Future net revenues at June 30, 1998 on the Company's U.S. properties reflect a weighted average price of $12.50 per BOE vs. $19.50 in its June 30, 1997 estimates.
The proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserve figures presented in this report are estimates based on reserve reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers. The estimation of reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers, resulting in imprecise determinations particularly with respect to new discoveries. Estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially, depending, in part, on the assumptions made and may be subject to material adjustment. Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves, which comprise a substantial portion of the Company's reserves, are, by their nature, much less certain than proved developed reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available
data as well as engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production or price changes for produced hydrocarbons subsequent to the date of the estimate may result in changes to such estimates. The estimates of future net revenues in this report reflect oil and gas prices and production costs as of the date of estimation, without escalation, except where changes in prices were escalated under the terms of existing contracts. There can be no assurance that such prices will be real or that the estimated production volumes will be produced during the period specified in such reports. Since June 30, 1998, (the date of the estimate and the date of this report) oil and gas prices have generally remained stable. The estimated reserves and future net revenues may be subject to material downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. A material change in estimated proved reserves or future net revenues could have a material effect on the Company.
UNITED STATES RESERVE ESTIMATES
The following tables present total proved developed and proved undeveloped reserve volumes as of June 30, 1998, and June 30, 1997, and estimates of the future net revenues and PV-10 Value therefrom. There can be no assurance that the estimates are accurate predictions of future net revenues from oil reserves or their present value.

The Company attributes the decline in present valuations to the relative decline in oil prices at the time of the estimates - wherein the weighted average price had declined from $19.50 at June 30, 1997, to $12.50 at June 30, 1998. This reflects a 36% decline in product prices, while present value has declined 43%. The differential also includes the downward adjustment of 10,900 barrels, net of actual production, as well as a relatively fixed operating cost base.
"Proved developed" oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating method. "Proved undeveloped" oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. In recent year the market for oil and gas has experienced substantial fluctuations, which have resulted in significant swings in the prices for oil and gas. The Company cannot predict the future of oil and gas prices or whether a future decline in prices will occur. Any such decline would have an adverse effect on the Company.
PAKISTAN RESERVE ESTIMATES - PROBABLE RECOVERABLE RESERVES
As previously reported and filed in a Form 8-K dated September 22, 1998, the Company retained Martin Petroleum and Associates to perform a preliminary reserve study on its Jacobabad Concession in the Middle Indus basin in central Pakistan. These reserves are not categorized as proven. Further, these reserves remain categorized by the Company as unproven. However, management has determined that the independent estimates of Probable Recoverable Reserves in the preliminary reserve study represent material information which merited disclosure to the shareholders. These independent estimates also served as justification to management to continue further exploratory drilling on its Pakistan Concession. The following summary represents total probable recoverable undeveloped natural gas reserve estimates as of June 30, 1998, and estimates of the future net revenues and PV-10 Value therefrom. There can be no assurance that the estimates are accurate predictions of future net revenues from these gas reserves or their present value.
GROSS PROBABLE RECOVERABLE GAS RESERVE ESTIMATES 5.159 TCF (Trillion Cubic Feet)
NET PROBABLE RECOVERABLE GAS RESERVE ESTIMATES 3.231 TCF (Trillion Cubic Feet)
NET PRESENT VALUE (Discounted @ 10%) $1,767,600,000 (TO THE COMPANY'S INTEREST)
Probable Recoverable Reserves as defined in the preliminary reserve study are "reserves which analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data does not demonstrate to be proved under current technology and existing economic conditions, but where such analysis suggests the likelihood of their existence and future recovery."
The estimation of reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers, resulting in imprecise determinations particularly with respect to new discoveries. Estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially, depending, in part, on the assumptions made, and may be subject to material adjustment. Estimates of probable undeveloped reserves, which are a substantial portion of the Company's reserves, are, by their nature, much less certain than proved developed reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data as well as engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production or price changes subsequent to the date of the estimate may result in changes to such estimates. The estimates of future net revenues in this report reflect gas prices and production costs as of the date of estimation, without escalation, except where changes in prices were escalated under the terms of existing contracts. There can be no assurance that such prices will be real or that the estimated production volumes will be produced during the period specified in such reports. Since June 30, 1998, (the date of the estimate and the date of this report) gas prices have generally remained stable. The estimated reserves and future net revenues may be subject to material downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, prevailing gas prices and other factors. A material change in categorization of reserves or future net revenues could have a material effect on the Company.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
Many of the Company's oil and gas properties are held in the form of mineral leases. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of developed and undeveloped properties. Title investigations covering the drillsites are generally completed, however, before commencement of drilling operations or the acquisition of producing properties. Generally, the Company's working interests are subject to customary royalty and overriding royalty interests, liens, current taxes, operating agreements and other customary imperfections of title which do not immediately affect operations. Properties acquired by purchases are also often subject to environmental covenants designed to protect the seller from liability for environmental damage. The Company believes that its methods of investigating title to, and acquisition of, its oil and
gas properties are consistent with practices customary in the industry and that it has generally satisfactory title to the leases covering its proved reserves.
