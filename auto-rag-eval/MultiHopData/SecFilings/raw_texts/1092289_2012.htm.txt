Item 2. Properties
Turkey
General. As of May 1, 2013, we held interests in 39 onshore and offshore exploration licenses and 12 onshore production leases covering a total of approximately 4.4 million gross acres (approximately 3.3 million net acres) in Turkey. We acquired our interests in Turkey through acquisitions, as well as through farm-in agreements with existing third-party license holders and through applications submitted to the Turkish General Directorate for Petroleum Affairs (the “GDPA”), the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey.
The following map shows our interests in Turkey:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2012, we had total net proved reserves of 9,492 Mbbl of oil and 12,229 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 7,946 Mbbl of oil and 12,074 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 15,229 Mbbl of oil and 104,140 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey.
Equipment Yards. As of May 1, 2013, we leased equipment yards in Muratli, Diyarbakir and Tekirdag and owned equipment yards at Selmo and Edirne.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and natural gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. The royalty rate is 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. Our revenue from the Selmo oil field is subject to an additional 10% royalty, which is offset by the amount of exploration expense that TEMI and DMLP, the owners of our interest in the Selmo oil field, incur in Turkey. If those exploration expenses do not equal or exceed the amount of this additional 10% royalty, we would owe the difference. Dividends repatriated from Turkey would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 15% unless reduced by a tax treaty.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA.
Index to Financial Statements The GDPA awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells. A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for petroleum. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments. A final three-year term may be granted as an appraisal period for any oil or natural gas discovery registered in the previous terms. No single company may own more than an aggregate of 100% of eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the hectares under the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder applies to convert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares, to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years and may be extended for two further terms of ten years each. Annual rentals are due based on the hectares comprising the lease. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease.

In 2013, we plan to perform workovers of existing wells on this license in order to establish commercial production, which would allow us to extend the license an additional three years. We are the operator of License 4126, which expires in December 2013.
Velimese (License 3791) and Cayirdere (License 3792). We own a 50% working interest in Licenses 3791 and 3792, which cover an aggregate of approximately 125,000 gross acres. As of May 1, 2013, we had seven producing wells on the Cayirdere exploration license and no producing wells on the Velimese exploration license. TPAO is the operator of Licenses 3791 and 3792, which expire in August 2013 and October 2013, respectively. We plan to apply for production leases on each of these licenses and reapply for exploration licenses covering the remaining acreage in 2013.
Southeastern Turkey. The following map shows our interests in southeastern Turkey:
Selmo (Production Lease 829). We own a 100% working interest in Production Lease 829, which covers 8,886 acres and includes the Selmo oil field. As of May 1, 2013, there were 48 producing wells on the Selmo production lease. For 2012, our net production of oil in the Selmo field was approximately 813,322 Bbls of oil, at
Index to Financial Statements
an average rate of approximately 2,222 Bbls per day. We are the operator of Production Lease 829, which expires in June 2015. We plan to submit an application to extend the expiration date of Production Lease 829 to June 2025.
Molla (Licenses 4174 and 4845) and West Molla (License 5046). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4174, 4845 and 5046, which cover an aggregate of approximately 112,000 acres adjacent to the northern border of our former License 3118 (now Production Lease 3118-5003). In 2012, we drilled the Goksu-3H and Bahar-1 wells, which have produced approximately 66,000 gross Bbls and 44,000 gross Bbls of oil, respectively, as of May 1, 2013. We are the operator of Licenses 4174, 4845 and 5046, which expire in June 2014, March 2015 and June 2016, respectively.
Arpatepe (Production Lease 5003 and License 5025). We own a 50% working interest in Production Lease 5003 and License 5025, which cover approximately 11,200 and 84,600 gross acres, respectively. For 2012, our net production of oil from the Arpatepe field was approximately 43,436 Bbls of oil, at an average rate of approximately 119 Bbls per day.

Aladdin is the operator of Production Lease 5003 and License 5025, which expire in November 2028 and February 2016, respectively.
Bakuk (License 5064 and Production Lease 5043). We own a 50% working interest in License 5064 and Production Lease 5043. The exploration license covers approximately 61,000 gross acres, and the production lease covers approximately 34,000 gross acres. As of May 1, 2013, there was one producing well on the Bakuk production lease. Tiway Turkey, Ltd. (“Tiway”) is the operator of License 5064 and Production Lease 5043, which expire in June 2016 and January 2032, respectively.
Idil (License 4642). We own a 50% working interest in License 4642, which covers approximately 123,000 gross acres. We plan to drill one well on this license in 2013. We are the operator of License 4642, which expires in October 2014.
Index to Financial Statements Central Basins. Our exploration licenses in central Turkey cover largely unexplored tertiary basins. We are currently seeking partners for these exploration licenses. Through farm-outs, we expect to reduce our exploration risk and accelerate the exploration and development activities on the farmed out properties. We intend to remain as operator of the properties that we farm-out. The following map shows our interests in central Turkey:
Yuksekkoy (Licenses 4350) and Adana (License 4842). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4350 and 4842, which cover an aggregate of approximately 242,000 acres in the Adana area of central Turkey. We are the operator of Licenses 4350 and 4842, which expire in March 2014 and June 2015, respectively. Based on reviews of the prospectivity within these licenses, we have applied to relinquish both of these licenses as of February 12, 2013.
Sivas Basin (Licenses 4729, 4730, 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, 4735, 4736, 4737, 4738, 4739, 4740 and 4741). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4729, 4730, 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, 4735, 4736, 4737, 4738, 4739, 4740 and 4741, which cover an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million acres in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. In 2012, pursuant to our farm-out agreement with Shell, we acquired 2D seismic and airborne gravity data over the licenses. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in December 2014.
Gurun (License 4325). We own a 90% working interest in License 4325, which covers approximately 122,000 gross acres in central Turkey. In April 2009, we farmed-in for a 90% interest in License 4325 for cash consideration and the obligation to carry a 10% interest in the first well drilled. During 2012, we drilled the Konak-1 exploration well, which did not encounter economic levels of hydrocarbons. We are the operator of License 4325, which expires in February 2014.
Index to Financial Statements Gaziantep (Licenses 4607, 4648, 4649 and 4656). We own a 62.5% working interest in Licenses 4607, 4648, 4649 and 4656 (subject to a 0.78% overriding royalty interest), which cover an aggregate of approximately 488,000 gross acres near the Turkish border with Syria. During 2012, we drilled the Alibey-1 exploration well, which was our first horizontal well to discover oil. We are the operator of these licenses, which expire in October 2013, except for License 4607, which expires in August 2013.
Bulgaria
General. As of May 1, 2013, we held interests in one onshore exploration permit and one production concession in Bulgaria. We acquired all of our Bulgarian interests through the purchase of Direct Bulgaria in February 2011. In January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in the Republic of Bulgaria. The legislation also had the effect of preventing conventional drilling and completion activities. In June 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament amended the legislation to clarify that conventional drilling and completion activities were not intended to be affected by the law. As long as this legislation remains in effect, our unconventional natural gas exploration, development and production activities in Bulgaria will be significantly constrained. The following map shows our interests in Bulgaria and Romania at December 31, 2012:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2012, we had total net proved reserves of 9 Mbbl of oil and 234 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 3 Mbbl of oil and 71 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 4 Mbbl of oil and 107 Mmcf of natural gas in Bulgaria.
Commercial Terms. Bulgaria’s petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties and income tax.
Index to Financial Statements The royalty ranges from 2.5% to 30%, based on an “R factor” which is particular to each production concession agreement, but is typically calculated by dividing the total cumulative revenues from a production concession by the total cumulative costs incurred for that production concession.
The production concession holder pays Bulgarian corporate income tax, which is assessed at a rate of 10%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Bulgaria are subject to a dividend withholding tax between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary to conduct petroleum operations. There is also a 20% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while natural gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Bulgaria for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in two stages: exploration permit and then production concession.
Under an exploration permit, the government grants exploration rights for a term of up to five years to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, including drilling. The recipient of an exploration permit commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. The area covered by an onshore exploration permit may be as large as 5,000 square kilometers. The exploration permit may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms, subject to fulfillment of minimum work programs, and may be extended for an additional one-year term in order to appraise potential geologic discoveries. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable, subject to government approval. The permit holder is required to pay an annual area fee equal to 30 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $20 at March 1, 2013) per square kilometer, or 45 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $30 at March 1, 2013) per square kilometer in the event the permit term is extended.
Upon the registration of a commercial discovery, an exploration permit holder may apply for a production concession. The production concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The duration of a production concession is 35 years and may be extended by a further 15 years subject to the terms and conditions of the production concession agreement. Interests under a production concession are transferable, subject to government approval. No bonus is paid to the government by the company upon conversion to a production concession.
Koynare. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 3.02% overriding royalty interest, in the Koynare production concession covering approximately 163,000 acres. The Koynare Concession Area contains the Deventci-R1 well, where we discovered a reservoir in the Jurassic-aged Ozirovo formation at a depth of approximately 13,800 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. In November 2011, we commenced drilling the Deventci-R2 appraisal well, on the Koynare Concession Area, which we suspended following the enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. We expect to resume drilling the Deventci-R2 well in 2013. As of May 1, 2013, we were coordinating our 2013 Koynare Concession Area work program with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy, Economy and Tourism. We are the operator of the Koynare production concession, which expires in 2047.
Stefenetz. In November 2011, we initiated the application procedure for a production concession covering approximately 395,000 acres over the southern portion of our former A-Lovech exploration permit. The Stefenetz Concession Area is estimated to contain over 300,000 prospective acres for Etropole shale formation at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. During 2012, we initiated an environmental impact assessment, which the Bulgarian government must approve prior to granting the production concession.
Index to Financial Statements In September 2011, we entered into an agreement with LNG pursuant to which LNG funded the drilling of an exploration well on the Stefenetz Concession Area to core and test the Etropole formation. This well, the Peshtene-R11, reached total depth in late November 2011, from which we collected more than 900 feet of core. We suspended drilling and completion of the Peshtene-R11 well following enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. We and LNG are evaluating the core data and developing a conventional completion program for the Peshtene-R11 well. If the well is successful and we obtain a production concession over the Stefenetz Concession Area, LNG would fund up to an additional $12.5 million in exchange for a 50% working interest in the production concession.
Aglen. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 1% overriding royalty interest, in the Aglen exploration permit, which covers approximately 1,700 acres within the boundaries of the former A-Lovech exploration permit and lies within the boundary of the Stefenetz Concession Area. The Aglen permit contains a prospective deep natural gas field that produced approximately 9.0 Bcf of natural gas before being abandoned in the late 1990s. We are the operator of the Aglen permit, which was set to expire in April 2012. Due to the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation, a force majeure event was recognized by the government. As of May 1, 2013, we were coordinating our Aglen work program with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy, Economy and Tourism.
Romania
General. As of May 1, 2013, we held a 50% working interest in Sud Craiova Block E III-7, which covers approximately 1.0 million gross acres in western Romania. Sterling is the operator of the Sud Craiova license, which was due to expire in December 2013. In 2012, the Romanian government temporarily suspended unconventional exploration of hydrocarbons, including fracture stimulation, pending a government review of unconventional drilling and completion techniques. As a result, on May 10, 2013, we and Sterling notified the government that we were relinquishing the license. As of December 31, 2012, there were no reserves associated with our Romanian properties. See “-Bulgaria-General” for a map showing our former interest in Romania.
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following table summarizes our net proved, probable and possible reserves at December 31, 2012 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, PV-10 and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2012:
Index to Financial Statements
(1) The PV-10 value of the estimated future net revenue is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure:
Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
At December 31, 2012, our estimated proved reserves were 11,578 Mboe, a decrease of 13.7% compared to 13,419 Mboe at December 31, 2011. During 2012, we added estimated proved reserves of 2,303 Mboe through extensions and discoveries driven by our 2012 drilling activity in Turkey. These increases were offset by production volumes of 1,655 Mboe and performance revisions in existing producing wells of 2,489 Mboe. The estimated undiscounted capital costs associated with our proved reserves is $93.3 million.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2012, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 5,094 Mboe, a decrease of 19.1% compared to 6,293 Mboe at December 31, 2011. This decrease in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to revisions for existing undeveloped reserves in Selmo to reflect the results of recent new wells. During 2012, we incurred $19.9 million in capital expenditures to drill and complete 14 proved undeveloped wells. At December 31, 2012, no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves. We intend to convert the proved undeveloped reserves disclosed as of December 31, 2012 to proved developed reserves within five years of the date they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves.
Probable Reserves
Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable
Index to Financial Statements
reserves estimates. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
At December 31, 2012, our estimated probable reserves were 9,972 Mboe, an increase of 44.3% compared to 6,912 Mboe at December 31, 2011. This increase in probable reserves was primarily attributable to the Bahar and Goksu discoveries on the Molla licenses.
Possible Reserves
Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
At December 31, 2012, our estimated possible reserves were 32,608 Mboe, an increase of 11.7% compared to 29,194 Mboe at December 31, 2011. This increase in possible reserves was primarily attributable to the Bahar and Goksu discoveries in the Molla licenses.
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain an outside independent engineering firm to prepare estimates of our proved, probable and possible reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Our internal audit department has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2012. Senior management reviews and approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally

or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of three outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves, and we are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves, using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves presented as of December 31, 2012 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our external engineers. The technical person at DeGolyer and MacNaughton that is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. He has over 30 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with DeGolyer and MacNaughton to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them for the preparation of their reserves estimates. We retain a third-party consultant as the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our reserve estimation process. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and Geology from Texas A&M University. She has over 30 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, including experience in production and reservoir engineering, and is a member of multiple professional organizations.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third-party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 21-Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves and standardized measure information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved, probable and possible reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2012 included a detailed review of our Selmo, Arpatepe, Bakuk, Molla and Thrace Basin properties in Turkey and our West Koynare field in Bulgaria. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that their estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether proved reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
Index to Financial Statements Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under Canadian Law
As a reporting issuer under Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario securities laws, we are required under Canadian law to comply with National Instrument 51-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities” (“NI 51-101”) implemented by the members of the Canadian Securities Administrators in all of our reserves related disclosures. DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated the Company’s reserves as of December 31, 2012, in accordance with the reserves definitions of NI 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluators Handbook (“COGEH”). Our annual oil and natural gas reserves disclosures prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and COGEH and filed in Canada are available at www.sedar.com.
Oil and Natural Gas Production
The following table sets forth our net production of oil and natural gas for 2012, 2011 and 2010:
(1) Does not include nominal production from properties in other countries.
(2) “Oil” volumes include condensate (light oil) and medium crude oil.
(3) During 2012, 2011 and 2010, our net production of oil in the Selmo oil field was 813,322 Bbls, 838,615 Bbls and 411,964 Bbls, respectively.
Production Prices and Production Costs
The following table sets forth the average sales price per Bbl of oil and Mcf of natural gas and the average production cost, not including ad valorem and severance taxes, per unit of production for each of 2012, 2011 and 2010:

Oil and Natural Gas Properties, Wells, Operations and Acreage
Productive Wells. The following table sets forth the number of productive wells (wells that were producing oil or natural gas or were capable of production) in which we held a working interest as of December 31, 2012:
(1) “Gross wells” means the wells in which we held a working interest (operating or non-operating).
(2) “Net wells” means the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
Developed Acreage. The following table sets forth our total gross and net developed acreage as of December 31, 2012:
(1) “Gross” means the total number of acres in which we had a working interest.
(2) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres.
Undeveloped Acreage. The following table sets forth our undeveloped land position as of December 31, 2012:
Index to Financial Statements
(1) “Gross” means the total number of acres in which we had a working interest.
(2) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres.
(3) On May 10, 2013, we notified the Romanian government that we were relinquishing our Sud Craiova license.
Undeveloped Acreage Expirations. The following table summarizes by year our undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years:
(1) Excludes the Koynare production concession that we were awarded in 2013, which expires in 2047. Also excludes the Stefenetz Concession Area for which we have applied for a production concession.
(2) “Gross” means the total number of acres in which we had a working interest.
(3) “Net” means the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres.
(4) Includes 494,211 net acres in Romania, which we are relinquishing.
We anticipate that we will be able to extend the license terms for substantially all of our undeveloped acreage in Turkey scheduled to expire in 2013 through the execution of our current work commitments.
