ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Mineral Exploration Activity
Properties
The majority of the Company's assets are located in Argentina. The Company owns a 25,000-acre ranch called the La Josefina Estancia, on which the Company's La Josefina project is located.
The Company also owns mobile housing units, trucks and additional mechanical equipment, all purchased within the last ten years and in good physical condition, to support exploration activities on the Company's projects, all located in Argentina.
La Josefina Property
The La Josefina property was our primary exploration property because it occupies 52,800 hectares and approximately 90% of the nearly 65,000 meters drilled by us. It is located in North-Central Santa Cruz province in southern Argentina, within the region known as Patagonia.
Exploration Agreement between Fomicruz and CCSA
In March 2007, CCSA was awarded the exploration and development rights from Fomento Minero de Santa Cruz Sociedad del Estado ("Fomicruz") through a required public bidding process to explore the La Josefina Project. As Fomicruz is a government owned company in Santa Cruz province in Argentina, it cannot make individual agreements with a private company without first publishing the offer and giving other private companies the opportunity to submit bids, but the first company making an offer has the right to match any new offer.
The definitive agreement between CCSA and Fomicruz was finalized in July, 2007. Pursuant to this agreement, CCSA was obligated to spend US$6 million in exploration and complete pre-feasibility and feasibility studies during a 4 year exploration period (excluding three months each year for winter holiday) commencing in October, 2007 at La Josefina in order to earn mining and production rights for a 40-year period in a joint venture partnership ("JV") with Fomicruz. CCSA may terminate this agreement at the end of each exploration stage if results are negative.
The 4-year exploration period was originally planned to proceed in the following three stages:
At the successful completion of positive pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, which cannot be assured, a new joint venture company will be formed to develop the project. This new company will have joint participating ownership with 91% owned by CCSA and 9% by Fomicruz; however, upon inception Fomicruz may elect to increase its participating interest in the new joint venture company to either a 19%, 29% or 49% by reimbursing CCSA 10%, 20% or 40%, respectively, of CCSA's total investment in the project. Once the choice is made by Fomicruz, there are no means to modify the agreement.
Other conditions of the agreement:
1.
CCSA posted a US$600,000 performance bond (equal to 10% of the total proposed exploration investment).
2.
CCSA must maintain the La Josefina mining rights by paying the annual canons due the province on the project's 398 pertenencias.
3.
CCSA must complete surface agreements (lease or buy) with the surface landowners, as required by the Federal mining law, to gain legal access to the farms (estancias) that cover the project. Most of the project and all of the current target areas lie within two large farms that have been unoccupied for many years - Estancia La Josefina and Estancia Piedra Labrada. The major part of mineralization occurs on Estancia La Josefina, which CCSA purchased in 2007. CCSA rents Estancia Piedra Labrada, which it uses as an exploration field camp.
Since CCSA fulfilled its exploration requirement mandated by the agreement with Fomicruz, the performance bond was no longer required to secure the La Josefina project. In June 2010, the Company used the bond to secure the La Valenciana project.
On November 15, 2012, we signed an amendment to our agreement with Fomicruz which extends the time we have to develop the La Josefina project by four years, from 2015 to 2019. The Company has agreed to make a minimum investment of US$12 million, of which it has already invested approximately US$9 million. Additionally, and subject to proof of compliance with committed investments, the Company has the option to continue exploration for a second additional term of four years, ending on June 30, 2019, requiring it to make an additional investment US$6 million, which will bring the total investments in the La Josefina Project to US$18 million.
Total costs incurred to date are approximately US$15 million.
The 2012 agreement provided a participating interest for Fomicruz over the minerals and metals extracted of 19% and the purchase option of up to a 49% participating interest in the incorporation of the future Company to be organized for the production and exploitation of the project, having Fomicruz contributing capital for the equivalent of such increase in percentage of participation. The Company has the right to buy back any increase in Fomicruz's ownership interest in the JV Corporation at a purchase price of USD$200,000 per each percentage interest owned by Fomicruz down to its initial ownership interest of 19%; the Company can purchase 10% of the Fomicruz's initial 19% JV Corporation ownership interest by negotiating a purchase price with Fomicruz.
In December, 2007, CCSA purchased the "La Josefina Estancia", a 92 square kilometer parcel of land within the La Josefina Project area. CCSA plans to use the La Josefina Estancia as a base of operations for Santa Cruz exploration. The purchase price for the La Josefina Estancia was US$710,000.
Initially, the La Josefina property was excluded from our exploration agreement with Eldorado Gold. This property was made subject to the exploration agreement with Eldorado Gold on May 7, 2013, an agreement later terminated by Eldorado in July 2013.
In 2014, the Company conducted a shallow Diamond drilling campaign, including 12 holes totaling 651 meters in length completed on the Maria Belen target and 15 holes totaling 957 meters on the Sinter target. Detailed results of the La Josefina drilling program are included in the Company's website, www.huntmining.com.
By late 2015, when the options for test milling the material that would be mined at La Josefina under this bulk sampling program seemed very limited, the Company began talks and eventual negotiations with Coeur Mining Inc. to the purchase the assets of the Mina Martha project approximately 110 km (65 miles) to the south of La Josefina from Coeur's Argentine subsidiary, Coeur Argentina SRL.
The Company has been actively pursuing a new exploration partner for the La Josefina project, as of the date of this filing these discussions are still in process.

Much of the following information is derived from, and based upon the La Josefina 2010 Technical Report, which is available for Hunt Mining Corp. on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") at www.sedar.com.
Property Description and Location
The La Josefina Project is situated about 450 km northwest of the city of Rio Gallegos, in the Department of Deseado, Santa Cruz province, Argentina within a scarcely populated steppe-like region known as Patagonia.
The La Josefina Project consists of mineral rights composed by an area of 528 square kilometers established in 1994 as a Mineral Reserve held by Fomicruz, an oil and mining company owned by the Santa Cruz provincial government.
The boundaries of the property are summarized in the following table:
*
The Argentine National Grid System (Gauss-Krüger) uses the Gauss-Krüger (also known as Transverse Mercator or TM) projection and is based on the Campo Inchauspe datum which uses the International 1924 (also known as Hayford) ellipsoid. Argentina is divided into seven zones which, similar to UTM zones, are north-south slices centered on 72°, 69°, 66°, 63°, 60°, 57° and 54° W longitude. Unlike UTM which effectively has two meridians of zero scale distortion, in Gauss-Krüger only the central meridian has zero scale distortion. Unlike UTM where the easting offset is always 500,000m, each zone in the Gauss-Krüger Campo Inchauspe system has a different offset to remove coordinate ambiguity between zones. Zone 1 has an easting offset of 1,500,000m with each successive zone adding 1,000,000m to the offset. Consequently, grid coordinates are often quoted without explicitly specifying the zone as would normally be done with UTM coordinates. A new national grid named POSGAR is currently being introduced. This datum uses the WGS84 ellipsoid and has already become common in some provinces.
The La Josefina Project comprises 16 Manifestations of Discovery totaling 52,776 hectares which are partially covered by 399 pertenencias, listed in the following table:
There is no geophysics. Geochemistry is conducted through ICP analysis (35+ elements) of all field and drill-hole samples. Even if no elevated precious metal grades are encountered this trace element analysis can still expose possible trends which often preclude gold and silver mineralization.
Royalties
Mineral properties in Argentina carry no federal royalties but the provinces are entitled to collect up to 3% mine-mouth royalty (MMR).
In Santa Cruz, the province has opted to drop this MMR to 1% if the operation is a precious metals mine that produces doré bullion within the province. The agreement between CCSA and Fomicruz stipulates that any doré bullion resulting from future La Josefina operations must be produced in the province, so it is likely the project will carry the minimal 1% MMR. However, because La Josefina is a Mining Resource in which the mineral rights belong to Fomicruz, the project also carries an additional 5% MMR payable to the province. Therefore, the total MMR for any future gold/silver/base metal production at La Josefina under the current agreement could total 6%.
Environmental Liabilities
There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the La Josefina Property.
Permits Required
No permits are required at this time to conduct the proposed exploration.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The project is located in the Deseado Massif mineral district in the north-central part of Santa Cruz province, the southernmost of several Argentine provinces comprising a vast, sparsely-populated, steppe-like region of South America known as Patagonia. The nearest town to the project is Gobernador Gregores (population 2,500), about 110 kilometers to the southwest. The nearest Atlantic coastal town is Puerto San Julián (population 6,800), 190 kilometers to the southeast. The project is reached by driving east from Gobernador Gregores for 40 km on gravel Provincial Route 25 - or west from Puerto San Julián for 170 km on the same road - and then north on gravel Provincial Route 12 for 110 km. Provincial Route 12 crosses the edge of the project and continues another 240 kilometers north to the oil town of Pico Truncado (population 16,500) in the northeastern part of the province.
The provincial gravel roads are generally accessible via two-wheel drive vehicles in dry weather but can become slippery or cannot be used for short periods when wet, so four wheel drive vehicles are sometimes required to access the project. Gobernador Gregores and Puerto San Julián are both served by fixed wing flights two or three times per week, to and from Comodoro Rivadavia (population 135,813), an important industrial center and port city. Comodoro Rivadavia lies 428 km north of Puerto San Julián. It can be reached via paved National Route 3, a major coastal highway. Comodoro Rivadavia serves as the region's major supply center for the booming petroleum and mining industries and is served by several airline daily flights to Buenos Aires and other major cities in Argentina. National Route 3 runs from Buenos Aires on the north to Ushuaia at the southernmost tip of the continent and offers all-weather access to a number of sea ports.
The Patagonia region is classified as a continental steppe-like climate. It is arid, very windy and has two distinct seasons, cold and warm. As Patagonia is located in the southern hemisphere, the cold winter months are from May to September and the warmer summer months are from November to March. The average annual precipitation averages only 200 mm (8 inches), much of which occurs as winter snow. Average monthly temperatures range from 3°C to 14°C, but vary widely depending on elevation. The winds are persistent, cool, dry and gusty, averaging about 36 km/h and directed predominantly to the east-southeast off the Andean Cordillera.
The La Josefina project area consists largely of subdued hilly terrain with internal drainages and playa lakes. Elevations range from 300 meters to 800 meters above sea level. Hill slopes are not steep, usually less than 10 degrees, and the rock exposures on these hillsides are typically abundant. Almost all of the mineralization and significant geochemical and geophysical anomalies are found on the crests or the flanks of these subdued hills.
The area is covered by sparse vegetation, consisting mostly of scattered low bushes and grass. In the area the only inhabitants are farm owners and employees. The nearest farms are Los Ventisqueros, Maria Esther, Las Vallas, La Florentina, La Laguna, La Josefina and Piedra Labrada.
The local economy was formerly based largely on sheep herding and marine fishing but in the late-1980s, sheep herding began a steep decline because of the Hudson volcano eruption and a descending economy; for those reasons many of the former large sheep farms are now unoccupied and in disrepair. The prolific sheep herds have since been replaced by overpopulated herds of wild guanacos, ostriches and flamingos (in the playas). One hundred km southeast of the property is the gold-silver epithermal Cerro Vanguardia Mine owned by AngloGold Ashanti Limited and Fomicruz.
Away from the towns and villages in Patagonia there are few power grids and scant telephone service. The many mineral exploration and development camps scattered widely throughout the Deseado Massif typically rely on diesel or gasoline generators for electrical power and satellite phones or radios for communications. Some communities in the region now have wind power generating stations and experimental hydrogen plants (Pico Truncado for example) and it is possible such stations might someday be utilized in mining camps to supplement their power requirements. However, the recent effort by the Santa Cruz Provincial Government to pave the Provincial Route 12, which runs within several kilometers of the project, may also include the construction of a power line which runs along the highway.
Near surface water tables exist on the La Josefina property.
Manpower is available in the larger communities to serve most exploration or mining operations.
History
Santa Cruz province - and indeed much of Patagonia - has only a short history of mineral prospecting and mining. Until the Cerro Vanguardia mine was commissioned in late 1989, only a few mineral occurrences had been identified within the 100,000 square kilometer area of the Deseado Massif. Notably, although Coeur Mining Corporation ceased active mining operations at its Martha Mine in September, 2012, the Desado Massif continues to host three producing mines: the Cerro Vanguardia Mine (AngloGold Ashanti Limited - Fomicruz), the San Jose - Huevos Verdes Mine (Hochschild Mining plc - Minera Andes Incorporated) and the Manantial Espejo Mine (Pan American Silver Corp.). Additionally, several new mines are being readied for production, and many active exploration projects (including Coeur Mining's Joaquin exploration project) are in progress.
In 1975, the first occurrence of metals known in the La Josefina area was publicly mentioned by the Patagonian delegation of the National Ministry of Mining. They reported the presence of an old lead-zinc mine in veins very near Estancia La Josefina. The mineralization received no further attention until 1994 when a research project by the Institute
of Mineral Resources of the Universidad Nacional de la Plata and the geology department of the University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco examined the occurrence. That investigation corroborated not only the presence of base metals, but also precious metals.
In 1994, immediately after the La Josefina gold-silver discovery, Fomicruz claimed the area as a Provincial Mineral Reserve and explored the project in collaboration with the Instituto de Recursos Minerales (INREMI) of La Plata University. The geology and alteration of the project area was mapped at a scale of 1:20,000. Mineralized structures and zones of sinter were mapped at 1:2,500, trenches across the structures were continuously sampled and mapped at scales of 1:100 and ground geophysical surveys consisting of 6,000 m of IP-resistivity and 5,750 meters of magnetic surveys were completed over sectors of greatest interest.
In 1998, after four years of exploring and advancing interest in the project, Fomicruz offered La Josefina for public bidding by international mining companies. In accordance with provincial law, the winner would continue exploring the project to earn the right to share production with Fomicruz of any commercial discoveries. The bid was awarded to Minamérica S. A. ("Minamerica"), a private Argentine mining company. Minamerica dug a limited number of new trenches, initiated a program of systematic surface geochemical sampling, completed several new IP-Resistivity geophysical survey lines and drilled the first exploration holes on the project - 12 diamond core holes totaling 1,320 meters in length. The results of this effort were relatively encouraging but Minamerica nevertheless abandoned the project a year later in 1999.
In 2000, Fomicruz resumed exploration of the project and continued their efforts until 2006. Pits were dug to bedrock on 100- grids over some of the target areas, 3,900 meters of new trenches were dug and sampled, more than 8,000 float, soil and outcrop samples were collected for geochemical analyses, some new IP-Resistivity surveys were completed under contract to Quantec Geophysical Co., and 59 diamond core holes (total 3,680 meters) were drilled to average shallow depth below surface of 55 s. Of these holes, 37 were NQ-size core (47.6mm diameter) and 22 were HQ-size core (63.5mm).
Fomicruz reported spending more than US$2.8 million in exploring and improving infrastructure on the La Josefina Project from 1994 to 2006. In late-2006, the La Josefina Project was again opened to international bidding and in May, 2007, CCSA was awarded the right to explore the project. Throughout 2007 and 2008, CCSA was mainly focused on an intensive drill plan (37,605 meters), and in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 reviewed all the data gathered in order to generate a geological model for the project, and continued working on regional exploration to define new additional targets for next drilling stages.
Geologic Setting
The La Josefina Project is located near the center of a large non-deformed stable platform known as the Deseado Massif, which covers an area of approximately 100,000 square kilometers in the northern third of Santa Cruz province. The Deseado Massif is a virtual twin of the Somun Cura Massif which encompasses an equally large area in the two adjoining provinces to the north. These two massifs are major metallotectonic features of the Patagonia region, and they are products of the massive continental volcanism formed by extensional rifting during the breakup of the South American and African continents in Jurassic time. The information in this paragraph is derived from "Tectonic Evolution of South America" prepared by Ramos, V.A and Aguirre-Urreta, M.B. in 2000 on behalf of the International Geological Congress.
The massifs are composed primarily of rhyolitic lavas, tuffs and ignimbrites which were erupted over a 50-million year period in middle-to late-Jurassic time (125 to 175 million years ago). The eruptives created a vast volcanic plateau which was subsequently segmented into the two massifs. These massifs are separated and bounded by sediment-filled basins: the Neuquén Basin north of the Somun Cura Massif, the San Jorge Basin between the massifs, and the Austral-Magellan Basin south of the Deseado Massif. These basins, filled largely with Cretaceous-age non-marine sedimentary rocks, are now sites of Argentina's largest oil and gas fields.
General Geology of the Deseado Massif
The geology of the Deseado Massif region has been described and discussed in numerous papers and reports published only during the last fifteen years. The geology has been mapped at various scales by government agencies, most recently covered by a series of 1:250,000 quadrangles published by the Instituto de Geología y Recursos Minerales and Servico Geológico Minero Argentino.
The Deseado Massif is dominated by a few major regional sequences comprised of felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks deposited in middle- to late-Jurassic time. The rocks are broken by a series of regional fractures that probably represent reactivated basement fracture zones. Faults that were active during the period of intense Jurassic extension and volcanism trend mostly NNW-SSE and form a series of grabens, half-grabens and horst blocks which are tilted slightly to the east. Since Jurassic time, the rocks have been cut by normal faults of several different orientations, mainly NW-SE and ENE-WSW, but have undergone very little compression. As a result, they remain relatively undeformed and generally flat-lying to gently dipping, except locally where close to faults, volcanic domes or similar features.
Exposures of rocks older than Jurassic are limited. The oldest pre-Jurassic "basement" rocks are small outcrops of metamorphic rocks thought to be late Precambrian to early Paleozoic in age (about 540 Ma). These rocks have been assigned to the La Modesta Formation in the western part of the area and to the Complejo Río Deseado in the eastern part. They consist of schists, phyllites, quartzites, gneisses and amphibolites and plutonic intrusions.
The Precambrian and older Paleozoic rocks are unconformably overlain by thick continental sedimentary sequences of late-Paleozoic to early-Mesozoic age, called La Golondrina Formation and El Tranquilo Group. La Golondrina Formation is Permian (299-251 Ma) and is up to 2,200m of arkosic to lithic sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates deposited in N-S to NW-SE rift basins along older reactivated basement structures. El Tranquilo Group is Triassic in age (251- 200 Ma) and is up to 650m of rhythmically bedded arkosic sandstones and shales which grade upward into conglomerates and redbeds.
The Triassic sequence is intruded and overlain by the first indications of igneous activity related to the crustal separation and extension initiated in early Jurassic: La Leona and the Roca Blanca Formations. La Leona Formation, early Jurassic in age (175-200 Ma), is composed of calc-alkaline granitic intrusive bodies sparsely scattered throughout the northeastern part of the Deseado Massif. The Roca Blanca Formation is also early Jurassic age, and consists of up to 900m of a coarsening-upward fluvial to lacustrine mudstone and sandstone sequence deposited in grabens or other rift basins, mainly in the south-central part of the Deseado Massif. The upper third of the sequence is distinctly richer in volcanic tuffs and other pyroclastic materials.
The Jurassic volcanic rocks are divided into formal units, but can be treated as a single bimodal (andesite-rhyolite) Jurassic volcanic complex. There are three units in this volcanic complex: the Cerro Leon and Bajo Pobre Formations and the Bahía Laura Group. The last two units make up the most extensive unit in the massif.
The Cerro Leon unit (lower to middle Jurassic in age) consists of hypabyssal mafic rocks composed of andesitic to basaltic dykes and shallow intrusions located in the south-central part of the massif. The Bajo Pobre Formation (middle to upper Jurassic in age) is typically 150-200m thick and is locally up to 600m thick. It is composed of andesites and volcanic agglomerates with minor basalts, which intercalate upwards with mafic tuffs, conglomerates and sediments. Olivine basalts, common in the lower part of the formation in the El Tranquilo anticline region are thought to be products of fissure eruptions from rifts related to the early stages of the Gondwana breakup and continental separation.
The Bahia Laura Group (middle to upper Jurassic in age) covers more than half the area of the massif and hosts more than 90 percent of the known gold-silver occurrences. It is a complex sequence of felsic volcanic-sedimentary rocks that has been divided into two formations according to whether there is a predominance of volcanic flows (Chon Aike Formation) vs. a predominance of volcaniclastic and sedimentary debris (La Matilde Formation). These two formations are complexly intercalated and have rapid lateral changes in facies and thickness which make it virtually impossible to define a coherent regional stratigraphy.
Non-marine sediments of late Jurassic to early Cretaceous age occur at various places throughout the Deseado Massif filling structural or erosional basins in the underlying Jurassic terrain. The presence of continental sediments in these basins, typically less than 150 meters thick, indicates that the massif remained as a positive geological feature throughout the Cretaceous. The most extensive cover rocks are a series of young basalt lava flows, Miocene to Quaternary in age, which blanket large parts of the region. The flows are typically only a few meters thick except where they fill paleo-valleys in the old land surface. In some cases, these thicker lava accumulations stand in relief above the surrounding landscape, providing classic examples of inverted topography caused by differential erosion. The youngest deposit consists of an extensive veneer of Quaternary gravels, especially in the eastern part of the massif.
Geology of the La Josefina Project Area
The oldest unit in the area is the La Modesta Formation, which crops out west of the La Josefina Estancia. It is formed mainly by grey to greenish micaceous-quartz schists and phyllites that occur in small outcrops. An angular unconformity separates the overlying La Modesta Formation from the mid-Jurassic basic to intermediate volcanic rocks of the Bajo Pobre Formation. The most extensive unit is represented by the Jurassic Bahia Laura Group which is divided in the Chon Aike Formation and La Matilde Formation tuffs. The Chon Aike formation is divided into nine members, representing each event a separated volcanic event. Each of the members is comprised of generally similar sequences consisting of basal surge breccia followed by pyroclastic flows (ignimbrites), ash-fall tuffs and finally by re-worked volcaniclastic detritus. Rhyolitic domes intrude the volcanic sequence, grading towards lavas in their upper parts. The lava flows and breccias are best developed in the southern part of the prospect area, where they occur with small vitrophiric bodies. Those volcanic events took place along 4 million years in the upper Jurassic and emplaced the epithermal system that generated the mineralization. Around 800 meters east of La Josefina farm old facilities there is a hill oriented north-south 200 meters long and 20 meters wide, with outcrops of a mega-breccia made out of ignimbrite boulders about 2-3 cubic meters in size. Finally, covering large extensions in the northern part of the area, Tertiary and Quaternary basaltic levels complete the geological sequence.
La Josefina basically draws matching geological features of The Deseado Massif:
·
There is one outcrop of metamorphic basement rocks belonging to the Paleozoic-age La Modesta Formation
·
There are several small inliers of andesitic volcanics belonging to the Bajo Pobre Formation which underlies the Chon Aike Formation
·
The area is dominated by Jurassic-age rhyolitic volcanic units. They belong to Chon Aike Formation.
·
Sedimentary and volcaniclastic units of Roca Blanca and La Matilde Formations are not present in the area, or perhaps have not been recognized or mapped yet
·
About half of the area is covered by thin Quaternary basalt flows
·
The project is crossed by a number of conjugate NNW-SSE and NE-SW sets of strong fault lineaments which are similar to those occurring throughout the Deseado Massif region
The La Josefina project is without known reserves as defined by SEC industry Guide No. 7
Deposit Types
The Deseado Massif is characterized by the presence of low-sulphidation type epithermal vein deposits that are spatially, temporally and genetically related to a complex and long-lived (more than 30 million years) Jurassic bimodal magmatic event associated with tectonic extension that spread out in a surface of 60,000 km2. The Deseado Massif hosts three active mines, including Cerro Vanguardia (AngloGold Ashanti Limited/Fomicruz), San José (Hochschild Mining plc/Minera Andes Incorporated) and Manantial Espejo (Pan American Silver Corp.). In addition, the region boasts a number of projects at the feasibility stage as well as more than 30 properties at the exploration stage.
Epithermal deposits are high-level hydrothermal systems which usually form within one kilometer of the surface at relatively low temperatures, generally in the range of 50°C to 200°C. They commonly represent deeper parts of fossil geothermal systems and some are associated with hot-spring activity at or near the surface. The term low-sulphidation represents a variety of epithermal deposits characteristically deficient in sulfide minerals. These low-sulphidation systems are also often called "quartz-adularia" vein systems after the two most common gangue (non-valuable) minerals in the veins - quartz and adularia (a potassium-aluminum bearing silicate mineral that forms from low-temperature hydrothermal solutions and is considered diagnostic of a low-sulphidation environment. The known deposits are steeply-dipping to sub-vertical fissure vein systems associated with intermediate to felsic volcanic centers in areas of regional faulting and are localized by structures, up to a or more in width and hundreds of s to several kilometers in length.
Most of the epithermal systems in the Deseado Massif consist of steeply-dipping tabular veins and breccias. The mineralization of economic interest in these veins generally occurs over a limited vertical range and is concentrated in discrete bodies ("shoots") of comparatively small lateral dimensions. They are comprised of quartz veins, stockwork veins and breccias that carry gold, electrum (a gold-silver alloy), silver sulfosalts, and up to a few percent sulfide minerals, mainly pyrite, with variable, but usually small, amounts of base metal sulfides - sphalerite, galena, and/or
chalcopyrite. The thickening and thinning along and down the structure - often referred to as "pinch and swell" - is responsible for rod-like high-grade ore shoots that are hallmarks of these systems. Common gangue minerals in the veins are quartz and other forms of silica, such as chalcedony, together with variable amounts of adularia, sericite, and sometimes distinct blades of calcite and rarely barite, either of which may be totally replaced by silica.
The metals associated with low sulphidation epithermal systems are commonly zoned laterally along strike and vertically with depth. The zonation can vary considerably from area to area, but the classic zonation pattern consists of a gold and silver top giving way vertically over a few hundred s depth to a relatively silver-rich zone with continuously increasing base metals (dominantly lead and zinc with sparse copper) at increasing depth. Mineralized epithermal vein systems are also very commonly associated with anomalous amounts of arsenic, mercury, antimony, thallium and/or potassium. Any or all of these elements can form broad halos of varying widths and intensities around the vein systems and they often serve as pathfinder elements in the geochemical exploration for epithermal mineral deposits. The geochemical signature of the Deseado Massif's typical epithermal deposit is characterized by anomalous precious metals (gold-silver) and locally anomalous amounts of arsenic, mercury, antimony, mercury, lead, zinc, manganese and copper.
The alteration halos extending outward in the wall-rocks away from the vein systems are typically relatively small in extent. In the Deseado Massif, more than 90 percent of the epithermal occurrences are hosted by silica-rich rhyodacitic tuffs and ash flow tuffs of the Chon Aike Formation. These rocks are chemically non-reactive and thus not usually widely or conspicuously altered, except perhaps close to the vein where they may be intensely and pervasively silicified. Halos of argillic, sericitic and prophyllitic alteration typically extend outward from the vein for a few s to rarely a few tens of s. In contrast, the andesitic lavas and volcaniclastics of the underlying Bajo Pobre Formation, which host about five percent of the epithermal occurrences, often show conspicuous clay alteration envelopes of variable width and intensity extending outward from the silicification adjacent to the vein.
In addition to the classic low sulphidation epithermal vein systems, La Josefina contains an additional target that represents an uncommon variation of the epithermal deposit model known as hot springs-type gold. Formed as the surface expression of an epithermal system at depth, hot springs-type deposits are characterized by laminated silica layers, known as "sinter," which occasionally may contain some gold. The pipeline conduit, or feeder, for these sinters may contain hydrothermal breccias ("pipeline" breccias).
La Valenciana Property
La Valenciana is the Company's second most advanced project. The property is located on the central-north area of the Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, and is located 25 kilometers to the west of the Company's main Piedra Labrada base camp. The project encompasses an area of approximately 29,600 hectares, and is contiguous to the Company's La Josefina property to the east. The La Valenciana project is comprised of 11 Manifestations of Discovery covering segments of Estancia Canodon Grande, Estancia Flecha Negra, Estancia Las Vallas, Estancia La Florentina, Estancia La Valenciana and Estancia La Modesta (inactive ranches).
Exploration Agreement between Fomicruz and CCSA
In 2010, the right to develop and mine the property was opened up for bidding to private companies. Hunt Mining Corp, through CCSA, was awarded the prospects and mining rights. We entered into an agreement with Fomicruz effective as of November 15, 2012, for the right to explore and develop the La Valenciana property for a period of seven years. The agreement with Fomicruz requires the Company to spend USD $5,000,000 in exploration on the project over 7 years.
Total costs incurred to date are approximately US$4 million.
Since CCSA fulfilled its exploration requirement mandated by the La Josefina agreement with Fomicruz, the performance bond was no longer required to secure the La Josefina project. In June 2010, the Company used the bond to secure the La Valenciana project.
If the Company elects to exercise its option to bring the La Valenciana project into production it must grant Fomicruz a 9% ownership in a new JV Corporation to be created by the Company to manage the project. If Fomicruz elects to increase their ownership they can under the following formula up to a maximum of 49% interest.
·
To purchase an additional 10% in the JV corporation, Fomicruz must reimburse the Company for 10% of the exploration expenses made by the Company during the exploration period;
·
To purchase the next 10% interest in the JV corporation, Fomicruz must reimburse the Company for 20% of the exploration expenses made by the Company during the exploration period;
·
To purchase a final additional 20% interest in the JV Corporation, Fomicruz must reimburse the Company for 25% of the exploration expenses made by the Company during the exploration period; bringing Fomicruz's total ownership interest in the JV Corporation to 49%.
At the Company's option it can purchase all but the 9% granted ownership interest in the JV Corporation from Fomicruz for USD $200,000 per percentage point owned. The remaining 9% can be purchased for a mutually agreed amount, to be determined by negotiation between Fomicruz and the Company
Royalties
Mineral properties in Argentina carry no federal royalties but the provinces are entitled to collect up to 3% mine-mouth royalty.
In Santa Cruz, the province has opted to drop this MMR to 1% if the operation is a precious metals mine that produces doré bullion within the province. The agreement between CCSA and Fomicruz stipulates that any doré bullion resulting from future La Valenciana operations must be produced in the province, so it is likely the project will carry the minimal 1% MMR. However, because La Valenciana is a Mining Reserve in which the mineral rights belong to Fomicruz, the project also carries an additional 5% MMR payable to the province. Therefore, the total MMR for any future gold/silver/base metal production at La Josefina under the current agreement could total 6%.
Environmental Liabilities
There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the La Valenciana Property.
Permits Required
No permits are required at this time to conduct the proposed exploration.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
As the property is adjacent to La Josefina, similar conditions exist. The project is located in the Deseado Massif mineral district in the north-central part of Santa Cruz province, the southernmost of several Argentine provinces comprising a vast, sparsely-populated, steppe-like region of South America known as Patagonia. The nearest town to the project is Gobernador Gregores (population 2,500), about 110 kilometers to the southwest. The nearest Atlantic coastal town is Puerto San Julián (population 6,800), 190 kilometers to the southeast. The project is reached by driving east from Gobernador Gregores for 40 km on gravel Provincial Route 25 - or west from Puerto San Julián for 170 km on the same road - and then north on gravel Provincial Route 12 for 110 km. Provincial Route 12 crosses the edge of the project and continues another 240 kilometers north to the oil town of Pico Truncado (population 16,500) in the northeastern part of the province.
The provincial gravel roads are generally accessible via two-wheel drive vehicles in dry weather but can become slippery or cannot be used for short periods when wet, so four wheel drive vehicles are sometimes required to access the project. Gobernador Gregores and Puerto San Julián are both served by fixed wing flights two or three times per week, to and from Comodoro Rivadavia (population 135,813), an important industrial center and port city. Comodoro Rivadavia lies 428 km north of Puerto San Julián. It can be reached via paved National Route 3, a major coastal highway. Comodoro Rivadavia serves as the region's major supply center for the booming petroleum and mining industries and is served by several airline daily flights to Buenos Aires and other major cities in Argentina. National Route 3 runs from Buenos Aires on the north to Ushuaia at the southernmost tip of the continent and offers all-weather access to a number of sea ports.
The Patagonia region is classified as a continental steppe-like climate. It is arid, very windy and has two distinct seasons, cold and warm. As Patagonia is located in the southern hemisphere, the cold winter months are from May to September and the warmer summer months are from November to March. The average annual precipitation averages only 200 mm (8 inches), much of which occurs as winter snow. Average monthly temperatures range from 3°C to 14°C, but vary widely depending on elevation. The winds are persistent, cool, dry and gusty, averaging about 36 km/h and directed predominantly to the east-southeast off the Andean Cordillera.
The area is covered by sparse vegetation, consisting mostly of scattered low bushes and grass. In the area the only inhabitants are farm owners and employees. The nearest farms are Los Ventisqueros, Maria Esther, Las Vallas, La Florentina, La Laguna, La Josefina and Piedra Labrada.
The local economy was formerly based largely on sheep herding and marine fishing but in the late-1980s, sheep herding began a steep decline because of the Hudson volcano eruption and a descending economy; for those reasons many of the former large sheep farms are now unoccupied and in disrepair. The prolific sheep herds have since been replaced by overpopulated herds of wild guanacos, ostriches and flamingos (in the playas). One hundred km southeast of the property is the gold-silver epithermal Cerro Vanguardia Mine owned by AngloGold Ashanti Limited and Fomicruz.
Away from the towns and villages in Patagonia there are few power grids and scant telephone service. The many mineral exploration and development camps scattered widely throughout the Deseado Massif typically rely on diesel or gasoline generators for electrical power and satellite phones or radios for communications. Some communities in the region now have wind power generating stations and experimental hydrogen plants (Pico Truncado for example) and it is possible such stations might someday be utilized in mining camps to supplement their power requirements. However, the recent effort by the Santa Cruz Provincial Government to pave the Provincial Route 12, which runs within several kilometers of the project, may also include the construction of a power line which runs along the highway.
Near surface water tables exist on the La Valenciana property.
Manpower is available in the larger communities to serve most exploration or mining operations.
Geology and Mineralization
Geology of La Valenciana Project, within the Deseado Massif, is characterized by abundant middle-to-late Jurassic Age volcanic and volcaniclastic rock units. The units are dominated by rhyolitic to rhyodacitic ignimbrite flows and lava domes together with subordinate agglomerates, volcanic breccias and tuffs with minor basalts, andesites and volcanic agglomerates intercalated upward with mafic tuffs, conglomerates and sediments. Faults active during the period of intense Jurassic extension and volcanism generally trend NNW-SSE and form a series of grabens, and horst blocks.
Since Jurassic time, the rocks have been cut by normal faults of several different orientations, but have undergone only a moderate amount of compression. In general, the Jurassic rocks remain relatively undeformed and remain flat to gently dipping, except locally where close to faults, volcanic domes or similar features. Thin Quaternary Age basalt flows conceal about half of the Jurassic Age rocks on the La Valenciana project.
The type of mineralization and alteration styles present across the project area are classified as sulfidation type epithermal deposits. Gold and silver occur in fissure vein systems localized in structures, often a meter or more wide and hundreds of meters long. They are comprised of quartz veins, stockworks and breccias, rich in adularia with some calcite, that carry gold, silver, electrum and some sulfides, primarily pyrite with small amounts of base metal sulfides.
The La Valenciana project is without known reserves as defined by SEC industry Guide No. 7.
The exploration targets consist of gold and silver mineralized quartz veins in volcanic host rocks. Current work is conducted on the La Josefina and La Valenciana claim blocks. La Josefina includes four major vein systems while La Valenciana harbors three. A total of more than 900 trenches and drillholes have been drilled with approximately 40,000 assayed samples. Higher gold values exceed 100 g/tone and higher silver values are above 1,000 g/t. Veins are formed by upward fluid migration and are therefore typically open to depth.
There is no geophysics. Geochemistry is conducted through ICP analysis (35+ elements) of all field and drill-hole samples. Even if no elevated precious metal grades are encountered this trace element analysis can still expose possible trends which often preclude gold and silver mineralization.
History
Several historical exploration programs, consisting of trenching, mapping and drilling by Fomicruz carried out from 1994 to 2000 and air geophysics including gamma spectrometry from 1996 to 1998, have taken place to date at La Valenciana, with the most recent exploration being conducted by CCSA. Initially, the La Valenciana property was excluded from our exploration agreement with Eldorado Gold. This property was made subject to the exploration agreement with Eldorado Gold on May 7, 2013, an agreement later terminated by Eldorado in July 2013.
In 2014, CCSA conducted a shallow Diamond drilling campaign on the La Valenciana project. This was the first drill program undertaken by the Company at La Valenciana and consisted of 42 holes totaling 3,000 meters, designed to partially test four separate targets: Principal, 19 holes totaling 1,135 meters; Valenciana, 6 holes totaling 438 meters; Rosario, 7 holes totaling 521 meters; and Florentina, 10 holes totaling 726 meters. Detailed results of the La Valenciana drilling program are included in the Company's website, www.huntmining.com.
The Company has been actively pursuing a new exploration partner for the La Valenciana project, as of the date of this filing these discussions are still in process.
There was no drilling activity during 2016 at La Valenciana.
Bajo Pobré Property
The Bajo Pobré property covers 3,190 hectares and is mainly on the Estancia Bajo Pobré. The property is located 90 kilometers south of the town of Las Heras.
In January, 2006, CCSA signed a letter of intent with FK Minera S.A., an arm's length party to CCSA and CCSA's former parent corporation, to acquire a 100% interest in the Bajo Pobré property, a gold exploration property located in Santa Cruz province, Argentina. On March 27, 2007 CCSA signed a definitive lease purchase agreement with FK Minera to acquire the Bajo Pobré property. Pursuant to this agreement, CCSA can earn up to a 100% equity interest in the Bajo Pobré property by making cash payments and exploration expenditures over a 5 year earn-in period.
The required expenditures and ownership levels upon meeting those requirements are:
The Company has completed all lease payments to FK Minera S.A., the owner of the Bajo Pobré property. The parties to the contract have finalized an amendment to the contract terms and therefore the Company's ability to retain rights to explore the Bajo Pobré property is affirmed. As part of the amendment, the Company's obligation of exploration expenditures has been waived by FK Minera S.A., thus affirming the Company's right to ownership.
Royalties
If CCSA is able to commence commercial production on the Bajo Pobré property, CCSA shall pay FK Minera S.A. the greater of a 1% Net Smelter Royalty ("NSR") on commercial production or US$100,000 per year. CCSA has the option to purchase the NSR for a lump sum payment of US$1,000,000 less the sum of all royalty payments made to FK Minera S.A. to that point.
Environmental Liabilities
There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the Bajo Pobré Property.
Permits Required
No permits are required at this time to conduct the proposed exploration.

Geology and Mineralization
The Bajo Pobré project comprises an extensive low sulphidation epithermal gold/silver vein and stock work system located in the North-central region of the Deseado Massif in Santa Cruz Argentina. The known extent of the Bajo Pobré gold system encompasses more than 12 kilometers of exposed vein strike within a 5 square kilometer area of intense hydrothermal alteration. The main vein system generally trends northeast and is comprised of at least five outcropping sub-parallel structures, varying between 1 and 10 meters in width, with an average outcrop width of 3 meters. These sub parallel veins converge on a hill which shows extensive stockwork, strong silicification, acid leaching and argillic alteration. The mineralization is hosted within permeable dacitic to andesitic tuffaceous rocks of the Jurassic age Bajo Pobré Formation.
The Company's Bajo Pobré project does not have any known reserves, and the property does not have any processing infrastructure or equipment on site. There are no power generation facilities on the property, and if it was to become a mine a power generation facility would have to be built or power lines would have to be run to the project. The property does have access to a good water supply that can be utilized for both drilling and processing should it become a mine.
The Bajo Pobré project is without known reserves as defined by SEC industry Guide No. 7.
History
The Bajo Pobré property was discovered in 1970 and has been worked intermittently by several government entities and private companies. However, serious exploration was not initiated until the mid- 90's with detailed geologic mapping and surface sampling. Assays from this sampling yielded up to 40 grams per ton gold. Drill targets identified from surface sampling were augmented in 2002 with additional targets derived from geophysical surveys. In 2003 and 2004, the property saw a limited amount of exploration drilling which tested a small portion of these targets. The specific work that was conducted from 1996 to 2004 included 62 line kilometers of IP/resistivity geophysical surveys, the emplacement and sampling of 40 trenches totaling 2,500 meters, more than 1000 surface chip and channel samples and 12 widely spaced shallow drill holes.
The Company has conducted cursory reconnaissance on the Bajo Pobré property. The Bajo Pobré property was included in our exploration agreement with Eldorado Gold, an agreement later terminated by Eldorado in July 2013.
Mineral Exploration Activity
The Company completed detailed geological mapping, surface soil sampling and advanced drill targeting during 2012 on the Bajo Pobré project. The Company did not carry out any exploration work on the Bajo Pobré project in 2013, 2014, 2015 or 2016.
Total costs incurred to date are approximately US$1.5 million.
There are no current detailed plans to conduct exploration on the property.
El Gateado Property
In March, 2006, CCSA acquired the right to conduct exploration on, through a claims staking process, the El Gateado property for a period of at least 1,000 days, commencing after the Argentine Government issues a formal claim notice, and retain 100% ownership of any mineral deposit found within.
We have not yet received a formal claim notice pertaining to the El Gateado property. Should a mineral deposit be discovered, CCSA has the exclusive option to file for mining rights on the property. The surface rights of our El Gateado claim are held by the following Ranches, Estancia Los Ventisqueros, Estancia La Primavera, Estancia La Virginia and Estancia Piedra Labrada. The El Gateado claims are filed with the government of Argentina under file #406.776/DPS/06.
The El Gateado project is without known reserves as defined by SEC industry Guide No. 7.
El Gateado is a 10,000 hectare exploration concession filed with the Santa Cruz Provincial mining authority. The El Gateado property is located in the north-central part of Santa Cruz province, contiguous to La Josefina on the east.

The El Gateado property shares the same general geology as all of the other Santa Cruz properties controlled by the Company. The gold-silver mineralization found at El Gateoado is hosted by rhyolitic volcanics of the Chon Aike Formation, which is the host for most other mineral occurrences found throughout the Deseado Massif. The type of mineralization and alteration observed can be characterized as low sulfidation, epithermal in style. Gold and silver occur in fissure vein systems localized by structures, often more than a meter wide and variable in length. They are comprised of veins, stockworks and breccias, rich in silica with some calcite. The majority of the exposed veins seen on the property are steeply-dipping to sub-vertical. The textures and other characteristics reported for these veins are indicative of high-level systems. This suggests gold-silver mineralization in the veins should extend well below the depths tested by the drilling done to date.
The El Gateado property does not have any processing facilities or equipment. The property has water available on site for drilling and processing if it was to become a mine after successful exploration, which cannot be assured.
The property does not have access to power, so power generation facilities would either have to be developed on site or power lines would have to be run to the project. At this early stage, the Company has not fully estimated what this would cost. The El Gateado property, being early stage, does not have any known reserves and the work has been exploratory in nature.
History
No known exploration had taken place at El Gateado prior to the work completed by CCSA from 2006 to 2011. During that time CCSA conducted an exploration program consisting of surface channel outcrop sampling, trenching, geological mapping, topographic surveying and more than 3,500 meters of diamond core drilling.
Mineral Exploration Activity - El Gateado
CCSA began field reconnaissance work on the El Gateado property in 2006 with the completion of a topographic survey, base map generation, and a staked grid. In late 2006 and early 2007, CCSA drilled 13 holes on the El Gateado property. Results of this drilling program, based on assay results over 1 g/t Au, were as follows (and are included in the Company's Filing Statement dated November 30, 2009, as filed on SEDAR on December 3, 2009):
CCSA incurred approximately US$706,000 in exploration expenses on the initial El Gateado drilling program. CCSA's management conducted all exploration processes except for drilling, which was conducted by an independent Argentine drilling contractor. All assay results above were based on assay work performed by an independent assay laboratory.
CCSA was encouraged by these drilling results. However, we did not conduct any exploration activity on the El Gateado property in 2008, 2009 or 2010.
In the first quarter of 2011, CCSA prepared roads and drill pads at El Gateado. Our Company has spent approximately $50,000 on this infrastructure work. During 2011, the Company completed 2,358 meters of drilling on the El Gateado property.
The Company did not carry out any exploration work on the El Gateado project in 2012, 2013 or 2014.
Total costs incurred to date are approximately US$1.5 million.
There are no current detailed plans to conduct exploration on the property.
Mina Martha Property
Location
The Martha property ("Martha") is located in the Province of Santa Cruz, Argentina (Figure 1.1.1). The closest community is the town of Gobernador Gregores, situated approximately 50 road kilometers (km) to the west-southwest of Martha. The property is the site of past exploration for, and surface and underground mining and recovery of, silver and gold from epithermal veins and vein breccias, previously operated by Coeur Mining Inc. (formerly, Coeur d'Alene Mine Corp, "Coeur"), and Yamana Inc. ("Yamana").
Figure 1.1.1. Location of the Martha Property in the Province of Santa Cruz, Argentina.
Property Description and Ownership
The property was purchased by Cerro Cazador SA (CCSA), an Argentine subsidiary of Hunt, from an Argentine subsidiary of Coeur. The intent to purchase was announced February 10, 2016 and closed May 11, 2016 as disclosed by Hunt on its website (www.huntmining.com). See note 7 of the 2016 financial statements for details on the purchase of the Mina Martha property.
The Martha property consists of approximately 7,850 hectares of concessions, various buildings and facilities, surface and underground mining and support equipment, a 480 tonne per day (tpd - maximum) crushing, grinding and flotation plant, tailings facility, various stockpiles and waste dumps, employee living and cafeteria quarters, and miscellaneous
physical materials remaining from the former operations of Coeur. In addition, Hunt has access to surface ranch ("estancia") lands surrounding the mine and mill site that are approximately 35,700 hectares in size.
Royal Gold Inc. holds a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty on all production from the Martha property; the obligation for which transferred from Coeur to Hunt (www.royalgold.com). In addition, the provincial government holds a 3% pit-head royalty from future production-
Geology and Mineralization
Silver and gold mineralization at Martha is hosted in Jurassic-aged felsic volcanic rocks of the Chon Aike Formation of the Bahia Laura volcanic complex (BLVC). Host rocks are relatively shallowly dipping ignimbrites, locally inter-bedded with thin sections of sedimentary strata.
The oldest geological unit in the Martha area is a crystal rich, dacitic ignimbrite, which is overlain by a thin, tuffaceous unit. Further up in the Chon Aike sequence rocks change to crystal rich, rhyolitic ignimbrite followed again by a thin layer of tuffaceous sediments. The upper part of the sequence at Martha is comprised of lithic rich, rhyodacitic ignimbrite related to a caldera-forming, volcanic event.
Most of the historic mineral deposits were hosted in the crystal rich ignimbrites and tuffaceous units (Paéz et al, 2015) although, locally, upper lithic fragment tuffs and ignimbrites can host high-grades of vein-hosted silver and gold. An example of the latter is the mineralization in the Betty deposit at Martha.
Martha mineralization is epithermal, intermediate sulfidation in style, hosted in quartz veins, veinlets and vein breccias cutting the margins of the Jurassic-aged caldera (Primero de Abril Caldera; Paéz et al, 2015). Vein widths vary significantly on surface from a few centimeters up to several meters. Banded textures are common in the wider veins. Adularia is a common gangue mineral in the quartz veins.
Status of Exploration
Exploration at Martha ceased in 2012; being focused in that year on work in the immediate mine area only. No district-scale exploration has been conducted since 2011. Exploration targets exist in the immediate mine and greater property areas. Hunt has plans to recommence prioritized exploration to support a future estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and potential recommencement of operations.
Currently, Hunt is compiling historic exploration data from all exploration data left on site to be used to support its future exploration, development and production activities.
Development and Operations
Currently the mine and mill facilities at Martha are dormant. All production operations at Martha ceased in 2012. Coeur maintained watch over the property and conducted some cleanup and environmental monitoring during the dormancy. This work continues by Hunt to ready the property for new exploration and development in support of a potential recommencement of production.
Hunt is considering initial potential production from remnant blocks of silver and gold mineralization in the Martha vein and to the east in the R4 and Del Medio System veins. Hunt's plan is to verify historic mineralization on these and other proximal structures with its own program of exploration and evaluation to determine the viability of new mining from surface and underground platforms. Other vein-hosted silver and gold mineralization targets occur on the Martha property and are slated for subsequent exploration confirmation and evaluation.
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates
There are no current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves on the Martha property. The former operator, Coeur filed the most recent Technical Report for Martha on www.sedar.com, January 2010, in which it disclosed Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources effective at the end of 2009. In 2012, Coeur suspended activities at Martha and restated Martha's Mineral Reserves as Mineral Resources, effective at year-end 2012 and annually thereafter; comprised of 52,000 tonnes
of Indicated Mineral Resources with an average silver grade of 465 g/t and an average gold grade of 0.58 g/t and 185,000 tonnes of Inferred Mineral Resources with an average silver grade of 163 g/t and 0.17 g/t of gold (Table 6.4.2). These Mineral Resources are considered historic in nature.
The Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify any of these historical estimates as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves. Hunt Mining is not treating the historical estimates as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.
Property Location
Martha is located in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, at 48o , 41', 33.94" south latitude and 69o , 42', 00.79" west longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds) at approximately 350 meters elevation (Figure 4.1.1). Access to Martha is by approximately 50 km of all-weather, graded, gravel roads commencing in Gobernador Gregores, a community of approximately 7,000 residents, to the east on provincial road (Ruta Provincial) 25, then turning north-northeast on Ruta Provincial 12, then east on a private access road to the site of the former mill and mine.

Minas (granting production rights).
The initial stage in the concession process is filing a Cateo which gives the filer exclusive prospecting rights over that area. Cateos can be any size but may not exceed 10,000 hectares. Once granted, the holder of a Cateo has exclusive right to establish an MD to protect its discoveries on a Cateo. MD's are filed as either a vein or a disseminated discovery. A square protection zone of up to 840 hectares for a vein, or 7,000 hectares for a disseminated MD can be declared around the discovery. The holder must provide an annual report presenting a program of work and investment for the protection zone. Once an MD is filed and granted the remaining area of the original Cateo is relinquished. An MD can later be converted to a Mina granting the holder the right to commence production subject to obtaining other permits. Surface landowners must grant permission to access mineral concessions.
All of Hunt's concessions at Martha are held as Minas. Annual payments are made to the Santa Cruz provincial government - half in June, half in December - located in the city of Rio Gallegos. In addition to the mineral concessions, Hunt has a 20-year renewable lease, from an Argentine corporation, of a nearby ranch (estancia) called "Estancia Cerro Primero de Abril". This ranch, approximately 35,700 hectares in size, surrounds the Martha mine and mill area.

Royalties and Taxes
The provincial governments in Argentina own the minerals. In October 2014, a new provincial law increased the mining royalty applicable to doré and concentrate to 3% of the pit-head (mine mouth) value, with certain allowable deductions. In addition, Royal Gold holds a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty on Martha.
We are not aware of any other rights, encumbrances, or obligations attached to Hunt's Martha property.
Environmental Liabilities
In conjunction with the purchase of the Martha assets, Coeur provided Hunt with guarantees against any employment and environmental liabilities. The amount of the guarantee is approximately$1,000,000. On May 6, 2016 the Company purchased the Mina Martha project that has an estimated life of 8 years. The Company is legally required to perform reclamation on the site to restore it to its original condition at the end of its useful life. In accordance with FASB ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations, the Company recognized the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation.
The Company capitalized that cost as part of the carrying amount of the flotation plant acquired as part of the Mina Martha project, which is depreciation on a straight-line basis over 8 years. See financial statement note 8 for details of the asset retirement obligation.
Permits Required to Conduct Work
Hunt is applying to reinstate previous operating permits granted by the province, including those to operate the historic mine, plant and tailings. To accomplish this, Hunt has engaged an independent consultant to perform an environmental audit of the property as agreed with the province. With regard to community relations, Hunt has experience with the local communities, notably the town of Gobernador Gregores. We are not aware of any impediments to the Martha project from the community relations aspect. We are not aware of any other significant factors or risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability of Hunt to perform work on the property.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
Martha is located 50 km by road northeast of Gobernador Gregores and 175 km westnorthwest of Puerto San Julian; both active population centers in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina. Access to Martha is via public gravel roads comprised of provincial routes 25 (east to west) and 12 (north to south). The Martha area is fully accessible by two-wheel-drive vehicles most of the year. The topography of the area is dominated by rounded hills, and flat-topped mesas separated by valleys and canyons with an altitude of about 350 m above sea level at the former mill site. Martha is located in a moderately arid area of southern Argentina where the chief vegetation types are drought resistant shrubs and grasses. The climate can be cold in winter with frequent snowfalls and strong winds but work is rarely affected by the weather.
The project site infrastructure includes offices, first-aid facilities, workshops, warehouse, powder magazines, underground mining equipment, surface utility and miscellaneous vehicles, crushing and grinding circuits (4 lines; 120 tonnes per day - tpd - each, maximum, throughput), flotation concentrators (two lines of rougher and cleaners), a tailings storage facility, water tanks, diesel storage, diesel power generation, communication satellite and WIFI and LAN networks, among others. In addition, all consumables remaining on site became the property of Hunt with the purchase.
Worker housing and cafeteria facilities exist at the Martha mill site though some employees commuted from Gobernador Gregores. Approximately 5 km west of the former mine there is also a 60-person camp with housing and dining facilities, warehouse/storage facilities, an office, and a laboratory with wet chemistry and fire assay capabilities. Some historic core and exploration samples are stored near the camp. Hunt's current workforce consists of geologists and support staff that stay in onsite camp facilities or in Gobernador Gregores.
Some surface water is available from ponds and springs. Process water was also available from dewatering activities of the underground operations. Water for domestic use at the camp is transported in trucks from Gobernador Gregores. Power is provided by on-site diesel generators.
History
Exploration and production at Martha has a relatively short history, commencing in the late 1990's with the activities of Yamana. There is no evidence of preYamana mining activity.
Yamana
In 1997, Yamana conducted regional exploration reconnaissance work in Santa Cruz, Argentina. This program resulted in the discovery of a wide vein, up to 4.7 true width meters on surface, grading up to 6.9 grams/metric tonne (g/t) gold (Au) and 5,200 g/t silver (Ag). This discovery outcrop occurred on the vein that subsequently named Martha. Surface work continued in the area in the spring of 1997.
Yamana initiated reconnaissance drilling on the property in January 1998 with shallow reverse circulation (RC) methods. Holes drilled during this phase returned samples with precious metals values of sufficient grade, in sulfidic and oxidized material along the Martha vein system, to justify additional drilling. Definition drilling used a combination of diamond drill core (DDH) and RC methods sited between (in-filling) the reconnaissance-phase drill holes. This work supported the completion of an initial Mineral Resource estimation in late 1999, followed by creation of the first mine plan for the property in February 2000.
The mineral rights were subsequently transferred to Compañía Minera Polimet S.A (Polimet); a wholly owned subsidiary of Yamana. Mine development started in October 2000 utilizing contractors. Mine production, from shallow surface pits, started late that year and the first direct shipping ore (DSO) was exported in February 2001. Mining activities lasted until October 2001 and the export of DSO continued to February 2002. Yamana produced nearly 2,300 gold ounces and 1.7 million silver ounces from approximately 4,000 tones of material (Coeur, Martha Mine Technical Report, 2006).
Coeur
On April 3, 2002, Coeur purchased Yamana's 100 percent interest in Polimet for US$2.5 million. From that point in time to late 2007, Coeur shipped Martha mined material to its Cerro Bayo mill and concentrator facilities near the town of Chile Chico, Chile; a distance of nearly 900 kilometers by road. Beginning in January 2008, all mine production from Martha was processed at a new mill and flotation plant located at the Martha mine site.
Exploration History
Since discovery of the Martha vein by Yamana, exploration proceeded at Martha annually until Coeur terminated activities in 2012. Typically, methods used in exploration included initial prospecting, sampling and mapping, followed by detailed sampling via trenching, geochemical analyses on the collected samples, air and ground geophysical surveying and, ultimately, drilling by RC and Core methods to evaluate anomalous geochemical results; in general, all of which are typical methods used within the minerals industry.
Yamana used RC drilling methods with track-mounted drills in the early days of the project. Coeur conducted some RC drilling in the province but shifted to diamond coring methods at Martha. Core drilling, completed from surface and underground platforms, consisted of IEW (25 mm), BQ (36 mm), NQ (47 mm) and HQ (64 mm) diameter drill holes. In addition, Coeur collected a significant amount of data from other exploration techniques, such as air and ground geophysics, Aster remote sensing data collection and interpretation and high-resolution topographic data collection.
Mine and Mill Production
Mining began at Martha by Yamana and continued by Coeur until late 2012. Yamana's mine production yielded Direct Shipping Ore (DSO), from shallow pits and limited underground workings, which was sent to foreign smelters.
From 2002 through late 2007, Coeur shipped all of its Martha concentrates to its Cerro Bayo mill and flotation plant near the town of Chile Chico in Region XI of southern Chile. Concentrates were trucked east from Martha to San Julian then north to Comodoro Rivadavia then west to Chile Chico; a distance of over 900 km. The cutoff grade for Mineral Reserves was, as a result, high (Table 6.4.4).
In 2006 and 2007, exploration and definition drilling was increased to define sufficient Mineral Reserves and additional Mineral Resources to justify the capital expense to build a mill and flotation concentrator on site at Martha. This program was successful and onsite processing commenced in December 2007. As a result, the Mineral Reserve cut-off grade, effective January 1, 2008 was reduced to 550 g/t silver equivalent
During its years of production, Martha produced over 530,000 tonnes of material and over 24 million ounces of silver and 31 thousand ounces of gold).
Martha Mineralized Zones
Silver and gold mineralization at Martha is located within a series banded and brecciated, veins and veinlets. The style of mineralization has been interpreted to be intermediate-sulfidation in character. The main trend of the mineralized systems is WNW and EW and dip steeply to moderately to the S, SW. On surface, mineralized structures can be several meters wide but often are much less than a meter in true width but may expand in width in the subsurface. Figure 7.3.1 shows some of the mineralized veins on surface and in shallow mine exposures.
Exploration target area
Several valid exploration target areas exist on the acquired property. They are grouped herein into four priority areas based on historic mineral resources, proximity to the mill and the amount and results of prior exploration work.
Priority 1. Martha Cluster; This cluster has produced the majority of Martha's silver and gold and contained the largest amount of historic mineral resources all from the Martha, R4 and Del Medio System veins. Together, the three systems form a belt of WNW-striking veins that is nearly 2 km long. Generally the veins dip to the S and SW at steep to moderate angles.
Priority 2. Northern Cluster; Veins in this cluster area occur within dacitic tuff and lithic ignimbrite, which stratigraphically overlies the more favorable crystal ignimbrite. Principal veins in this cluster include: Betty, Betty West, Martha Norte, Ivana and Isabel Oeste. A few core holes, drilled in the Isabel Oeste target, in this cluster intersected high-grade silver mineralization in the crystal ignimbrite.
Priority 3. Areas peripheral to Martha; Veins in this area are Martha Oest Martha Sur, Futuro, Esperanza, Estero and Wendy. It is reasonable to expect that review of historic data will identify zones deserving of new exploration investment. Of particular interest is the large block of thin, lithic ignimbrite and crystal ignimbrite S and SW of the).
Priority 4. This area lies to the north of the main Martha concession within the Ana concession. A small breccia body of sulfidic, base and precious metal mineralization, called Tesoro, occurs in this block. Other notable vein targets in the Ana block are Leonor and Teres Exploration
The prior property owners conducted exploration at Martha relatively continuously over its more than 10-year history. Typically, work commenced with standard geologic mapping and reconnaissance to identify areas for more detailed work and, ultimately, drilling targets
Other Projects:
The Company has completed an analysis of the regional data generated from the Eldorado Exploration agreement with the goal of identifying new precious metal targets in its Santa Cruz property portfolio. The Company is determining which properties continue to have merit and warrant further generative exploration.
