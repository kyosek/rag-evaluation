The loan bears interest at a rate of 9.01% per annum, and requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $291,290 with a balloon payment of $15,921,746 due on May 1, 2008 for the entire outstanding principal balance. The loan may not be prepaid during the first 10 years, and thereafter may be prepaid in full, but not in part, only upon the payment of, among other things, a make-whole premium.
The initial term of the lease expires on April 30, 2018 with three five-year renewal terms for all or less than all of the BB Properties. If Best Buy elects a renewal for less than all properties, basic rent for shall be reduced by a percentage approximately equal to the percentage of basic rent attributable to the Best Buy properties as to which lease is not renewed. Basic rent for the second or third renewal term shall be based on fair market rental value.

If the rate is higher than 9.01% per annum, then the annual basic rent for the period will be adjusted upward on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the annual increase in the installments. No adjustment in basic rent will be made if the rate is less than 9.01% per annum.
If, by April 15, 2008, the BB Partnership is unable to obtain such a loan to refinance the outstanding balance of the existing loan, then the BB Partnership shall so notify Best Buy and, on May 1, 2008, Best Buy shall prepay the basic rent for the remaining 10 years of the initial term by making a payment in the amount of $15,750,000 (subject to certain reductions) and, so long as no default in the payment of rent or event of default related to certain financial covenants and environmental matters exists under the lease on either April 15, 2008 or May 1, 2008, no additional payments of basic rent will be payable by Best Buy for the balance of the initial term.
