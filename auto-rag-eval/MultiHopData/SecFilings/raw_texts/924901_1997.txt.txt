Substantially all of the leases provide for annual base rents plus recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant's proportionate share of and/or increases in real estate taxes and certain operating costs, as defined, and the pass through of charges for electrical usage.
(3) Total base rent for 1997 minus total 1997 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP.
(4) Base rent for 1997 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 1997. For those Properties acquired by the Company during 1997, amounts presented are annualized, as per Note 7.

(7) As this Property was acquired by the Company during 1997, the amounts represented in 1997 base rent and 1997 effective rent reflect only that portion of the year during which the Company owned or placed the Property in service. Accordingly, these amounts may not be indicative of the Property's full year results. For comparison purposes, the amounts represented in 1997 average base rent per sq. ft. and 1997 average effective rent per sq. ft. for this Property have been calculated by taking 1997 base rent and 1997 effective rent for such Property and annualizing these partial-year results, dividing such annualized amounts by the net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 1997.

In addition to being home to the two largest cities in New Jersey, Newark and Jersey City, Newark International Airport and the New York/New Jersey Harbor are also located within the five-county boundary.
Overall vacancy rates have declined in the Northern New Jersey market for the fifth consecutive year as a direct result of an increase in leasing activity and net absorption levels.

The Company owns and operates approximately 8.6 million square feet of office and office/flex space in Northern New Jersey.
Central New Jersey: The Central New Jersey market consists of Union, Somerset, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Mercer and Monmouth Counties. Encompassing approximately 2,000 square miles in six counties, Central New Jersey is notable for its proximity to major highway arteries, including Interstates 78 and 287, Route 1, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. This market continues to be a prime location for Fortune 500 headquarters, research & development operations and financial, insurance and real estate (FIRE) sector businesses.
Central New Jersey vacancy rates are decreasing while average asking rents are increasing.
