The increase in occupancy at Briar Bay Racquet Club Apartments is due in part to an overall decrease in turnover at the property. In addition, the exterior appearance of the property has favorably impacted occupancy. Exterior repairs and painting were completed in 1997 in an attempt to improve the curb appeal of this property. The increase in occupancy at Chimney Hill Apartments is attributable to the completion of several capital improvement projects coupled with increased marketing efforts in 1998. The increase in occupancy at The Citadel is attributable to a more aggressive marketing program at the property in 1998. The decrease in occupancy at Lake Forest Apartments is due to increased home ownership combined with vacancies caused by competitive market rents. The increase in occupancy at South Port Apartments is due to exterior building improvements that increased unit appeal and overall improvement in the strength of the local market.
As noted under "Item 1. Description of Business", the real estate industry is highly competitive. All of the properties of the Partnership are subject to competition from other residential apartment complexes in the areas in which they operate. The General Partner believes that all of the properties are adequately insured and are in good physical condition, subject to normal depreciation and deterioration as is typical for assets of this type and age. Each property is an apartment complex which leases units for lease terms of one year or less. No tenant leases 10% or more of the available rental space.
