ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.
GENERAL
As of March 24, 2000 we own nine existing multifamily apartment communities containing a total of 1,779 apartment homes, and three communities under development or construction that will contain approximately 853 apartment homes. Eight of our existing communities - River Oaks, Rosewood Plantation, Plantation Trace, Preston Oaks, Highland Park, Crestmark, Ivey Brook, and Bradford Creek - containing a total of 1,661 apartment units, are stabilized. Our 118-unit first phase of Addison Place, formerly referred to as Abbotts Bridge, is now in its initial lease-up phase. Addison Place's second phase, totaling 285 apartment homes and Ballantyne, totaling 319 apartment homes, are under construction. Our Old Norcross community, anticipated to total 249 apartment homes, is in the development stage. All of our communities are located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, except the Ballantyne community, which is located in Charlotte, North Carolina.
As of December 31, 1999, we owned eight stabilized communities containing a total of 1,661 apartment homes that had a physical occupancy rate of 92.6%. We sold the 118-unit Bentley Place community on August 23, 1999.
We believe that the demand for multifamily housing in Atlanta will increase due to Atlanta's growing population. According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which we refer to as the ARC, both population and job growth in Atlanta are projected to be above the national average for the foreseeable future. The ARC is the regional planning and governmental coordination agency for the 10-county Atlanta Region, which is comprised of Fulton, Dekalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton, Rockdale, Henry, Douglas, Cherokee, and Fayette counties.
The following information is based on statistical estimates published by the ARC. The population of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow 40.9% for the period from 1990 to 2010, from 2,557,800 persons in 1990 to 3,603,800 persons in 2010. The estimated population of the Atlanta Region increased by 25.3% from 2,557,800 persons in 1990 to 3,204,900 persons in 1999, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and the largest in the Southeast.
Employment of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow 52.5% for the period from 1990 to 2010, from 1,426,000 jobs in 1990 to 2,175,000 jobs in 2010. Estimated employment of the Atlanta Region increased by 29.0% from 1,426,000 jobs in 1990 to 1,840,000 jobs in 1998. According to the Georgia Department of Labor, the estimated December 1999 unemployment rate of the Atlanta Region was 2.6%, which was below the estimated December 1999 Georgia unemployment rate of 3.2% and the estimated December 1999 U.S. unemployment rate of 3.7%.
Housing units in the Atlanta Region increased an estimated 25.9%, from 1,052,430 units in 1990 to 1,324,511 units in 1999. Multifamily homes in the Atlanta Region increased 17.1% from 342,441 units in 1990 to 400,973 units in 1999.
The following table summarizes basic information about our communities.
THE COMMUNITIES
(1) Plantation Trace was completed in 2 phases. The 182-unit first phase was completed in 1990 and the 50-unit second phase was completed in 1998.
(2) Crestmark was completed in 2 phases. The 248-unit first phase was completed in 1993 and the 86-unit second phase was completed in 1997.
(3) Preston Oaks was completed in 2 phases. The 189-unit first phase was completed in 1995 and the 24-unit second phase was completed in 1998.
(4) The 118-unit first phase of Addison Place was in its lease-up phase at December 31, 1999, and its 12-month historical occupancy percentage is not comparable.
(5) Because this community is still in the development stage, the date of completion and exact number of units are estimates and are subject to change, and the square footage information is not available.
Annual operating data regarding our stabilized communities at December 31, 1999 are summarized in the following table (with the second phases of Crestmark, Preston Oaks and Plantation Trace described separately for this purpose and Windsong and Bentley Place omitted due to their sales in January 1998 and August 1999, respectively). Except for those figures noted with an asterisk, the occupancy rates shown represent the average physical occupancy of the applicable community calculated by dividing the total number of vacant days by the total possible number of vacant days for each year and then subtracting the resulting number from 100%. The figures noted with asterisks reflect the applicable data on December 31 of the specified year and are not annualized, because the applicable community was under construction and in its initial lease-up period during at least a portion of that year. During lease-up, units are leased as they are constructed and made ready for occupancy building by building, thus annualization of data is not possible during that period. Throughout this table, "N/A" means "not applicable," i.e., no unit in the community was available to be occupied during the relevant year. Footnotes are on the following page.
- --------------- (1) Plantation Trace Phase II completed its lease-up phase in November 1998 and Preston Oaks Phase II completed its lease-up in August 1998. Beginning with 1999, both phases of Plantation Trace and Preston Oaks are combined. (2) We acquired Crestmark in June 1996. Phase II of Crestmark completed its lease-up in September 1997. Beginning with 1998, both phases of Crestmark are combined. (3) Bradford Creek completed its lease-up in August 1998.
As described below, our Atlanta communities are located in Gwinnett, Fulton and Douglas Counties and six submarkets, or geographic areas, within these counties. We also have one community in Charlotte. The Ballantyne community now under construction in Charlotte is described after the Georgia properties. Each heading identifies the community or communities within the specified county and submarket. We obtained population and employment data for each Atlanta submarket from the ARC. Multiple communities are located in each of the Duluth, Peachtree Corners and Perimeter Center/North Springs submarkets; thus those communities compete not only with unaffiliated apartment communities but also with each other. Please see "Summary of Debt Secured by the Communities," which follows the description of the individual communities, for an explanation of the terms of our secured indebtedness.

The Ballantyne community will be located on a 23.8 acre site at the intersection of Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) and John J. Delaney Drive. The Ballantyne area is the largest mixed-use development in Mecklenburg County. This community will have 319 garden-style apartments. The Ballantyne community will consist of 110 one-bedroom units ranging from 765 square feet to 1,034 square feet, 143 two-bedroom units ranging from 1,150 square feet to 1,550 square feet, 48 three-bedroom units at 1,706 square feet, and 18 four-bedroom units at 2,074 square feet, along with 36 direct-entry garages. We have not developed a final estimate of the construction cost. The community is located near I-485 and I-77, which offers convenient access to downtown Charlotte and I-85.
The table on the following page summarizes the amenities of each of the existing communities and Addison Place Phase II, which is now under construction. We have not yet fully determined the specific amenities of the Ballantyne and Old Norcross communities.
SUMMARY OF AMENITIES OF THE COMMUNITIES
- ------------------- * In select units (1) Phase II only.
(2) Phase I only.
COMPETITION
All of the communities are located in developed areas, and numerous other apartment projects are located within the market area of each community. The number of competitive apartment communities in the area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease our apartments at the rental rates anticipated, and we can give no assurances regarding the development of additional competing multifamily communities in the future. The remainder of this section summarizes the competition for each of the communities. The following information reflects our study of apartment communities in each submarket that we believe to be closely competitive with our community or communities within that submarket. This section includes summary information we obtained from various sources - including developers and real estate brokers, as well as on-site visits - regarding those apartment communities. Although we have attempted to verify the information and believe that it is substantially accurate on the whole, information regarding a particular community may be incorrect due to the sources relied upon or erroneous information supplied by competitors.
Plantation Trace, River Oaks, and Bradford Creek. The Duluth submarket, which we consider to include the area within a two mile radius from these communities, currently consists of 17 multifamily communities, including River Oaks, Plantation Trace, and Bradford Creek. Although the Bridgewater apartment community - which was previously developed and sold by an affiliate of Mr. Roberts - is located more than two miles from Plantation Trace, it is also included in the Duluth market area because it offers units with attached garages and its architecture and amenities are similar to Plantation Trace. Of the 17 existing communities in the area, five were completed in the last two years, including Bradford Creek and the second phase of Plantation Trace. Due to the quality of construction, age of the communities, type of amenities, resident profiles and rental rates, we believe that only nine of the other 14 communities are in direct competition with Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek.
Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook. The Peachtree Corners multifamily submarket, which we believe includes the area within a three mile radius from these two communities, currently consists of 27 multifamily communities, including Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook. Of the 27 existing communities in the market area, only eight have been built since 1988. The remaining communities range from approximately 13 to over 20 years old. We believe that Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook draw residents from all of the other 25 communities located in the market area but that only six of the 25 communities compete closely with Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook.
Preston Oaks. We believe that the north central Perimeter multifamily submarket includes the area within a two-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by Roswell Road to the west, Ashford Dunwoody Road to the east, Spalding Drive to the north and Glenridge Drive to the south, and it currently consists of 25 multifamily communities, including Preston Oaks. Of the 24 other existing communities in the market area, only six were built before 1983. The remaining 18 communities range from approximately one to eight years of age. We believe that Preston Oaks competes with all 24 of these communities.
Highland Park. We believe the North Springs multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the north and west, Georgia 400 to the east and Dalrymple Road to the south, and currently consists of 34 communities, including Highland Park. Of the 34 existing communities in the market area, only five have been built since 1989. The remaining communities range in age from 12 years to over 20 years. We believe that Highland Park will draw residents from all of the other 33 communities located in the market area, but that only 11 of the 33 communities will compete closely with Highland Park.
Crestmark. We consider the Thornton Road multifamily submarket to be the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the Crestmark community. It is generally bounded by I-20 to the south, Blairs Bridge Road to the east, and Georgia Highway 78 to the north and west, and it currently consists of eight communities, including Crestmark. Of the eight existing communities in the market area, four have been built since 1990. We believe that Crestmark will draw residents from all of the seven other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only five of the seven other communities will compete closely with Crestmark.
Addison Place. We believe the Alpharetta multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the Abbotts Bridge community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the east,
Old Alabama to the south, Georgia 400 to the west, and Windward Parkway to the north, and it currently consists of 15 communities, including Addison Place. We believe that Addison Place will draw residents from all of the 14 other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only 13 of the 14 other communities will compete closely with Addison Place.
Ballantyne. We consider the Ballantyne multifamily submarket to include the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the community. It is generally bounded by the Princeton Road to the east, Providence Road West to the south, Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) to the west, and I-485 to the north, and it currently consists of nine communities, including Ballantyne. We believe that once construction of Ballantyne is complete, it will draw residents from all of the eight other existing communities located in the market area and will compete with the four communities under construction in the market area.
Old Norcross. We believe the Old Norcross multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the Old Norcross community. It is generally bounded by Herrington Road to the east, Club Drive to the south, Steve Reynolds Boulevard to the west, and Sugarloaf to the north and east, and it currently consists of 24 communities, including Old Norcross. We believe that Old Norcross will draw residents from all of the 23 other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only 15 of the 23 other communities will compete closely with Old Norcross.
SUMMARY OF DEBT SECURED BY THE COMMUNITIES
Information regarding our indebtedness secured by the communities is as follows:
- ------------------
(1) Each of the loans secured by the Plantation Trace, Rosewood Plantation and Addison Place Phase I communities may be prepaid upon payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% multiplied by a fraction having as its numerator the number of months to maturity and its denominator the number of months in the full term of the loan, or (b) the present value of the loan less the amount of principal and accrued interest being repaid. Each loan may be prepaid in full during the last 30 days before its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
(2) Each of the loans secured by the River Oaks, Preston Oaks, Highland Park, Ivey Brook and Bradford Creek communities may be prepaid in full upon payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the outstanding principal balance of the loan, or (b) the sum of the present value of the scheduled monthly payments to the maturity date and the present value of the balloon payment due on the maturity date, less the outstanding principal balance of the loan on the date of prepayment. Each loan may be prepaid in full during the last 90 days before its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
(3) The loan secured by the Crestmark community may be prepaid upon the payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the outstanding principal balance, or (b) the product obtained by multiplying the amount of principal being prepaid by the excess (if any) of the monthly note rate over the assumed reinvestment rate by the present value factor. If the loan is prepaid after expiration of the yield maintenance period, but more than 90 days before the maturity date, the prepayment premium shall be 1% of the unpaid principal balance of the note. The loan may be prepaid in full during the last 90 days before its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
(4) The loan secured by Addison Place Phase I includes interest only payments for the first year of $55,021 per month. Beginning with the December 2000 payment, the principal and interest payments will be $62,885 per month.
POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES TO BE DEVELOPED
From time to time Roberts Properties plans the development of other apartment communities to be located on property owned by Roberts Properties or other affiliates of Mr. Roberts, or on property that one of those entities is interested in acquiring. Mr. Roberts may elect to raise the required equity by syndicating a limited partnership. Alternatively, we may seek to raise the equity required to purchase and develop the community by selling shares. If Mr. Roberts elects to raise equity through a limited partnership, Mr. Roberts may seek to cause the partnership to be merged into the operating partnership at a later date. A transaction of that nature would require the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners of the partnership and of a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors, and we can give no assurances regarding whether Mr. Roberts will ultimately determine to seek a merger in that manner, or whether such a merger would in fact be approved by the requisite majority in interest of limited partners in the partnership and by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board.
As described above in "Part I, Item 1, Description of Business - Growth Strategies - Development Strategy," three other multifamily apartment communities that are anticipated to total 853 apartment homes are in the development or construction stage.
OTHER REAL ESTATE ASSETS
The operating partnership sold its two retail centers totaling 15,698 square feet on July 17, 1998 for $2,400,000 in cash resulting in a gain, net of minority interest, of $300,000. Net sales proceeds were $2,182,000, after deducting for closing costs and prorations of $218,000. We reinvested the net proceeds in new apartment communities. The purchaser was unaffiliated with us, and the transaction was negotiated at arms-length. The net book value of the property was $1,715,000 at June 30, 1998. We paid Roberts Properties $92,500 for consulting fees in connection with the sale. The retail centers together composed less than 1% of our assets and generated less than 2% of our gross revenues for 1998.
