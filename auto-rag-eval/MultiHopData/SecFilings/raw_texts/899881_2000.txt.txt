ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
INDUSTRIAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES
ProLogis and its consolidated entities (see -- "Consolidated Entities") have invested primarily in generic industrial distribution facilities with an average office finish level of less than 10%. Due to the costs associated
with retrofitting customer spaces, service center product has been acquired only on a very limited basis, generally as part of portfolio acquisitions in which the majority of product being acquired was bulk distribution. ProLogis' industrial distribution facilities is typically used for storage, packaging, assembly, distribution and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products.
- Distribution. -- ProLogis' distribution facilities are adaptable for both bulk distribution and light manufacturing or assembly uses. Based upon square footage, ProLogis' operating portfolio was comprised of 88.5% bulk distribution and 10.4% light manufacturing facilities as of December 31, 2000.
- Service Center and Other -- Under ProLogis' definition, service centers are multi-customer buildings that have a higher percentage of office space than distribution facilities and only have grade-level loading as opposed to truck dock loading. As of December 31, 2000, service center product constituted approximately 0.9% of the square feet in ProLogis' operating portfolio and other miscellaneous facilities, primarily office facilities acquired as part of portfolio acquisitions, constituted 0.2% of the square feet in ProLogis' operating portfolio.

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES
Partnerships
As of December 31, 2000, ProLogis held a majority interest in and controlled five partnerships (collectively, the "Partnerships"), which are consolidated with the accounts of ProLogis. Generally, pursuant to the Partnership agreements, ProLogis or one of its wholly owned entities, is the sole controlling general partner and has full responsibility for the management and control of the Partnerships. The limited partners have no authority to transact business for, or, except as noted below, participate in the management decisions of, the Partnerships. However, any decision to amend certain provisions of the applicable partnership agreement, to dissolve a Partnership prior to the term set forth in the applicable partnership agreement or to enter into certain extraordinary transactions would require the consent of all limited partners. Pursuant to the partnership agreements, ProLogis, or its wholly owned entity, as the case may be, may not voluntarily withdraw from the
applicable Partnership or transfer or assign its interests in the Partnership without the consent of all of the limited partners thereto. The limited partners may freely transfer their Partnership units to affiliates, provided that such transfer does not cause a termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and does not cause ProLogis to cease to comply with requirements under the Code for qualification as a REIT. Each of the Partnership agreements grants to the limited partners the right to exchange their Partnership units for ProLogis common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, ("Common Shares"), subject to certain conditions. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of each of the Partnerships are included in ProLogis' consolidated financial statements, and the interests of the limited partners are reflected as minority interest. See Note 6 to ProLogis' Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Partnerships, which are part of the property operations segment, are as follows as of December 31, 2000:
- --------------- (1) These facilities cannot be sold, prior to the occurrence of certain events, without the consent of the limited partners thereto, other than in tax-deferred exchange transactions.
(2) Facilities are located in the San Francisco (both South Bay and East Bay) and Tampa markets.
(3) Convertible into Common Shares on a one for one basis.

(5) Facilities are located in the Chicago, Ft. Lauderdale/Miami, Norfolk, Orlando, San Antonio and Tampa markets.
(6) ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV was formed through a cash contribution from a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis, ProLogis-IV, Inc., and the contribution of distribution facilities from the limited partner. ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV and ProLogis-IV, Inc. are legal entities separate and distinct from ProLogis, its affiliates and each other, and each has separate assets, liabilities, business functions and operations. The sole assets of ProLogis-IV, Inc. are its general partner advances to and its interest in ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV. As of December 31, 2000, ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV had outstanding borrowings from ProLogis-IV, Inc., of $0.4 million and ProLogis-IV, Inc. had outstanding borrowings from ProLogis and its affiliates of $0.4 million.

ProLogis Development Services
ProLogis Development Services, which is part of the CDFS business segment, develops distribution facilities that are often disposed of to customers, third parties or entities in which ProLogis maintains an ownership interest. ProLogis Development Services also contracts on a fee basis to develop distribution facilities for customers or third parties. ProLogis owns 100% of the preferred stock of ProLogis Development Services and realizes substantially all economic benefits of its activities. Because ProLogis advances mortgage loans to ProLogis Development Services to fund its acquisition, development and construction activities, ProLogis
Development Services is consolidated with ProLogis. ProLogis Development Services' real estate assets represented 9.7% of ProLogis' total real estate assets (at cost) as of December 31, 2000. ProLogis Development Services is not a qualified REIT subsidiary of ProLogis under the Code. Accordingly, provisions for federal and state income taxes are recognized, as appropriate.
UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES
As of December 31, 2000, ProLogis' investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities totaled $1.45 billion. These investments were structured to either allow ProLogis to comply with the requirements of the Code to qualify as a REIT or to further ProLogis' objective of increasing cash flows without raising additional capital through direct public debt and public equity offerings.
ProLogis invested in the nonvoting preferred stock of certain entities that have ownership interests in companies that produce income that is not REIT "qualifying" income (i.e., rental income and mortgage interest income) under the Code. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, ProLogis can collectively invest in these entities in amounts up to 25% of the fair market value of ProLogis' total assets, with a maximum per company investment of 5% of the fair market value of ProLogis' total assets. Of these investments, ProLogis Development Services, ProLogis Logistics, Frigoscandia S.A. and the Kingspark entities all own properties. ProLogis accounts for the investments in ProLogis Logistics, Frigoscandia S.A. and the Kingspark entities under the equity method. These entities' investments in properties are discussed under "-- CDFS Business" and "-- Temperature-Controlled Distribution Operations". Because ProLogis advances mortgage loans to ProLogis Development Services to fund its acquisition, development and construction activities, ProLogis Development Services is consolidated with ProLogis. Properties owned by ProLogis Development Services are included in the tables in "-- Geographic Distribution" and "-- Facilities" and ProLogis Development Services is discussed in "-- Consolidated Entities--ProLogis Development Services". See also "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- New Tax Legislation".
The entities discussed below under "-- Property Operations" were all formed to allow ProLogis to generate capital for future development activities while still maintaining an ownership position in the facilities. All of ProLogis' unconsolidated entities are discussed in Note 4 to ProLogis' Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The Kingspark entities' facilities and land acreage are located in 12 cities or counties in the United Kingdom.

See "Item 1. Business -- Business Strategy and Operating Segments -- CDFS Business Segment", "Item 7.
