ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have royalty interests and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage royalties, as well their respective reserves are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have royalties, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The description of our principal royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Royalties on Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential royalty revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause Royal Gold to conclude that one or more of such royalty interests are no longer principal to our business. As
of June 30, 2013, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically) to be principal to our business.
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
We own a royalty on all gold produced from the sulfide portion of the Andacollo copper and gold deposit. The Andacollo royalty equals 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the deposit at the Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold, and 50% of the gold produced in excess of 910,000 payable ounces of gold. As of June 30, 2013, approximately 167,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold.
Andacollo is an open-pit copper mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo ("Teck"). Andacollo is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo project by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curving to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Reported production at Andacollo increased approximately 33% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increase in reported production is partially due to increased mill throughput and improved mill recoveries, partially offset by lower grades. Over the last few quarters of our fiscal year 2013, Andacollo has established steady state operations will mill throughput averaging about 47,000 tonnes per day during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
Canadian Malartic (Quebec, Canada)
We own a 1.0% to 1.5% sliding-scale NSR royalty ($0.00 to $350.00 - 1.0%; above $350 - 1.5%) on the Canadian Malartic open-pit gold mine and milling operation located in Quebec, Canada, and owned by Osisko Mining Corporation ("Osisko"). The Canadian Malartic gold property is located in the Abitibi Gold Belt in Quebec, Canada, immediately south of the town of Malartic, Quebec, approximately 16 miles west of the town of Val d'Or. The northern extent of the Canadian Malartic property can be accessed directly from the Trans Canadian Highway 117.
Reported production at Canadian Malartic increased approximately 17% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, as a result of the continued ramp-up of mill throughput as operations progressed towards steady state.
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a large open-pit and underground mine, utilizing mill and heap leach processing. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline, South Pipeline, Gap and Crossroads deposits which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)Reserve Claims ("GSR1"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the "Reserve Claims," which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR royalty rate on the Reserve Claims is tied to the gold price as shown in the table below and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation.
(b)GAS Claims ("GSR2"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the "GAS Claims," which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR royalty rate on the GAS Claims, as shown in the table below, is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation.
(c)Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty ("GSR3"). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)Net Value Royalty ("NVR1"). This is a fixed 1.25% NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. The Company owns 31.6% of the 1.25% NVR (or 0.39%) while limited partners (including certain directors of the Company) in the partnership, which is consolidated in our financial statements, own the remaining portion of the 1.25% NVR. Our 0.39% portion of the NVR1 royalty does not cover the mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
The following shows the current sliding-scale GSR1 and GSR2 royalty rates under our royalty agreement with Cortez:
Reported production at Cortez decreased approximately 30% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, as Barrick continued to prioritize production from their higher grade Cortez Hills operation that is not covered by our royalty interest. During our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, mining resumed at the Pipeline and Gap pits as surface mining equipment returned from the Cortez Hills pit. Our royalty interests cover all of the Pipeline pit and part of the Gap pit.
Holt (Ontario, Canada)
We own a sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Holt portion of the Holloway-Holt mining project located in Ontario, Canada and owned 100% by St Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ("St Andrew"). The Holloway-Holt project straddles Ontario Provincial Highway 101 for approximately 25 miles beginning east of Matheson, Ontario, Canada and extending to the Quebec, Canada border. The sliding-scale NSR royalty rate on gold produced from the Holt portion of the mining project is calculated by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. For example, at a quarterly average gold price of $1,300 per ounce, the effective royalty rate payable would be 16.9%.
Reported production at Holt increased 37% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. St Andrews credited additional mine infrastructure and mine development for the operational improvements.
Las Cruces (Andalucía, Spain)
We own a 1.5% NSR royalty on the Las Cruces copper mine and milling operation located in Andalucía, Spain and operated by First Quantum Minerals Ltd. ("First Quantum"). First Quantum completed an acquisition of Inmet Mining Corporation in April 2013 and now operates the Las Cruces mine. The Las Cruces mine is located in the Seville Province of southern Spain, about 12 miles northwest of the Provincial capital city of Seville. Access to the site is by well-maintained paved roads.
Reported production at Las Cruces increased approximately 29% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increase in reported production is primarily due to continued work on process optimization and improved plant maintenance. First Quantum plans to test the plant at higher ore throughput and lower grade to assess
the metallurgical performance before Las Cruces enters into lower copper grade areas of the mine, which is expected in calendar 2014.
Mulatos (Sonora, Mexico)
We own a 1.0% to 5.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Mulatos open-pit mine and heap leach operation in southeastern Sonora, Mexico. The Mulatos mine is located approximately 137 miles east of the city of Hermosillo and 186 miles south of the border with the United States and is operated by a subsidiary of Alamos Gold, Inc. ("Alamos"). Access to the mine from the city of Hermosillo can be made via private chartered flight or paved and gravel road.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based on the gold price as shown in the following table:
The Mulatos royalty is capped at 2.0 million gold ounces of production. As of June 30, 2013, approximately 1.1 million cumulative ounces of gold have been produced.
Reported production at Mulatos increased approximately 29% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Alamos reported that the increase in reported production was primarily attributable to higher crusher throughput and the benefit of two quarters of production from the Escondida high-grade zone that was not in production in the prior year.
Alamos reported that the Escondida high-grade deposit is expected to continue to provide high grade mill feed until early calendar 2014, at which point the Escondida deep zone will be accessed to provide mill feed for an additional quarter. Alamos also reported that they anticipate receiving the permit to begin development of the El Victor and San Carlos deposit areas in the third quarter of calendar 2013, following which development activities will commence in anticipation of processing high grade from San Carlos in mid-calendar 2014.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp. The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. Access to the site is via either paved or cobbled roads west out of Concepción del Oro nine miles to the town of Mazapil and then further approximately seven miles west from Mazapil. Direct access to the mine site can also be achieved via chartered flight.
Reported production for gold at Peñasquito increased approximately 26% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, while reported production for silver, lead and zinc decreased when compared to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Goldcorp's annual guidance for Peñasquito anticipated lower production in the first half of calendar 2013 as the mine moves from a lower grade portion of the pit
to higher grade ore. The sulphide plant achieved throughput of over 105,000 tonnes per day during the second quarter of calendar 2013 following the completion of crusher maintenance, blasting improvements, and the addition of new fresh water wells. In the month of June 2013, the sulphide plant achieved throughput of over 120,000 tonnes per day.
Goldcorp has also reported that ongoing studies to develop a long-term water strategy continue to progress and that they have identified a new water source within their current permitted basin that has the potential to supply sufficient water to continue the plant ramp-up to full design capacity. The addition of the new water source provides the flexibility to resume ramp-up to the design throughput of 130,000 tonnes per day. Construction is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of calendar 2013 with completion expected in the second half of calendar 2014. Goldcorp is currently working to acquire necessary rights-of-way and is evaluating alternative routes to access the well field.
Robinson Mine (Nevada, USA)
We own a 3.0% NSR royalty on all mineral production from the Robinson open-pit mine operation operated by a subsidiary of KGHM International Ltd. ("KGHM"). Access to the property is via Nevada State Highway 50, 6.5 miles west of Ely, Nevada, in White Pine County.
Reported copper production at Robinson increased approximately 39% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to improved mill recovery and higher productivity at the mine. Mining of higher grade gold areas in the pit have resulted in favorable gold production during calendar 2013. Gold production during the remainder of calendar 2013 is likely to return to more normal gold grades.
Voisey's Bay (Labrador, Canada)
We own 90% of a 3.0% NSR royalty (or an effective 2.7% NSR royalty) on the Voisey's Bay nickel-copper-cobalt mine located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and operated by Vale Newfoundland & Labrador Limited ("Vale"). A non-controlling interest owns the remainder. The Voisey's Bay project is located on the northeast coast of Labrador, on a peninsula bordered to the north by Anaktalak Bay and to the south by Voisey's Bay. The property is 560 miles north-northwest of St. John's, the capital of the Province. Access to the property is primarily by helicopter or small aircraft. We have disputed the manner of calculation of our royalty payments. Please refer to Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the dispute.
Reported nickel production at Voisey's Bay increased approximately 9% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, while reported copper production decreased approximately 5% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. In late March 2013, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, announced amendments to their Voisey's Bay Development Agreement including a commitment from Vale to pursue underground mining to extend the mine life. The agreement also allows Vale to continue processing concentrate outside of the province while construction is being finalized at the Long Harbour processing plant.
Wolverine (Yukon Territory, Canada)
We own a 0.00% to 9.445% sliding-scale NSR royalty on all gold and silver produced from the Wolverine underground mine and milling operation located in Yukon Territory, Canada, and operated by Yukon Zinc Corporation ("Yukon Zinc"). The Wolverine property is located 106 miles north-northwest of Watson Lake in south central Yukon Territory. Access to the property is provided by a 17 mile gravel road heading south and then northeast to the Robert Campbell Highway at a point approximately 120 miles north of Watson Lake. Direct access to the mine site can also be achieved via chartered flight.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty on all gold and silver is based on the silver price as shown in the following table:
Reported production at Wolverine increased significantly over the prior year. Yukon Zinc reported that the mine reached its design capacity rate of 1,700 tonnes per day during the first quarter of calendar 2013, and that process circuit modifications and the integration of new equipment have improved plant performance. In June 2013, Yukon Zinc announced that it reduced production at Wolverine by 40% and its workforce by 30% in an effort to reduce costs and improve its working capital situation. Yukon Zinc reported that the cost reduction steps are a result of current lower metal prices and market conditions. Milling operations will be batch processed in two week periods to efficiently process 1,900 tonnes per day. Mining will reduce to a one shift per day operation. Yukon Zinc reported that they are committed to review the project economics in October 2013 and evaluate the possibility to resume full production.
Principal Royalties on Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal royalty interests on development stage properties (listed alphabetically). Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Mt. Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
We own the right to purchase 52.25% of the payable gold produced from the Mt. Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, and operated by Thompson Creek. The Mt. Milligan project is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mt. Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road.
Upon commencement of production at the Mt. Milligan project, RGLD Gold AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, will purchase 52.25% of the payable ounces of gold at a cash purchase price equal to the lesser of $435, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price for each payable ounce of gold.
As of May 2013, Thompson Creek estimated that project completion was at 92%. Thompson Creek also reported that the Mt. Milligan project remains on schedule with mill commissioning to commence in August 2013, followed by commercial production expected in the fourth quarter of calendar 2013.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
We own a 0.78% to 5.23% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. The Company owns an additional royalty equivalent to 1.05% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick's operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of
Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interest is applicable to all gold production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million, (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) Royal Gold also increased its interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note:Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
Pascua-Lama is one of the world's largest gold and silver desposit with nearly 18 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, 676 million ounces of silver contained within the gold reserves, and an expected mine life of 25 years. It is expected to produce an average of 800,000-850,000 ounces of gold and 35 million ounces of silver annually during its first full five years of operation.
Construction activities on the Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama mining project are currently suspended pursuant to a court ruling while Barrick addresses environmental and other regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of Chilean authorities. Barrick has submitted a plan for review by the regulators to construct a water management system in compliance with permit conditions for completion by the end of 2014, after which it expects to resume the remaining construction work in Chile. Barrick intends to re-sequence construction of the process plant and other facilities in Argentina in order to target first production by mid-2016. Barrick expects capital costs for this project to total $8.0 to $8.5 billion, though Barrick has stated that it is unable to fully assess the impact on the overall capital budget, operating costs and schedule of the Pascua-Lama project until the regulatory and legal issues are clarified.
Reserve Information
Table 1 below summarizes proven and probable reserves for gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, cobalt and molybdenum that are subject to our royalty interests as of December 31, 2012, as reported to us by the operators of the mines. Properties are currently in production unless noted as development ("DEV") within the table. The exploration royalties we own do not contain proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2012. Please refer to pages 31-33 for the footnotes to Table 1.

(2)Gold reserves were calculated by the operators at the following per ounce prices: A$1,600-Paddington; $1,500-Bald Mountain, Cortez, Gold Strike, and Williams; A$1,500-South Laverton; $1,490-Bousquet/Cadillac/Joannes; $1,475-Canadian Malartic; $1,400-Don Mario, Holt, Leeville, Mulatos, and Twin Creeks; A$1,400-Southern Cross; $1,366-Schaft Creek; $1,350-Dolores, Peñasquito, Tulsequah Chief, and Wharf; $1,310-Soledad; $1,300-Pinson; A$1,300-Meekatharra: Nannine, Paddy's Flat; Reedys and Yaloginda; $1,250-El Limon, Gwalia Deeps, King of the Hills, and Taparko; $1,200-Gold Hill, Inata, and Pascua Lama; $1,100-Don Nicolas and Mara Rosa; $1,010-Andacollo; $1,000-Robinson; $983-Pine Cove; $690-Mt. Milligan. No gold price was reported for Balcooma, El Toqui, Kundip, Kutcho Creek, Marigold, and Wolverine.
(3)Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Reserve" is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. "Proven (Measured) Reserves" are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established.
"Probable (Indicated) Reserves" are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
(4)Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of
"mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(5)The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)"Contained ounces" or "contained pounds" do not take into account recovery losses in mining and processing the ore.
(7)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $375-1.75%; >$375 to $400-2.0%; >$400 to $425-2.25%; >$425-2.5%. All price points are stated in 1986 dollars and are subject to adjustment in accordance with a blended index comprised of labor, diesel fuel, industrial commodities and mining machinery.

(9)NVR1 and GSR3 reserves and additional mineralized material are subsets of the reserves and additional mineralized material covered by GSR1 and GSR2.
(10)Round Mountain, a joint venture between Kinross and Barrick, has the right, at any time, to purchase the royalty interest for $10.0 million less any royalty payments paid prior to the purchase option being exercised. The royalty is subject to a minimum royalty payment of $100,000 per year, which is capped at $1.0 million. As of March 31, 2013, minimum royalty payments totaling $975,000 have been received. Once all royalty payments and the minimum royalty payment equals $10.0 million, the royalty terminates.
(11)The 1.0% to 2.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty will pay 2.0% when the price of gold is above $350 per ounce and 1.0% when the price of gold falls to $350 per ounce or below. The 0.6% to 0.9% NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $300-0.6%; $300 to $350-0.7%; > $350 to $400-0.8%; > $400-0.9%. The silver royalty rate is based on the price of gold.
(12)The 0.6% to 0.9% sliding-scale NSR applies to the M-ACE claims. The operator did not break out reserves or resources subject to the M-ACE claims royalty.
(13)Royalty only applies to Section 29 which currently holds about 95% of the reserves reported for the property. An additional Cordilleran royalty applies to a portion of Section 28.
(14)Royalty only applies to Section 29 which currently holds about 95% of the reserves reported for the property. Additional Rayrock royalties apply to Sections 28, 32 and 33; these royalty rates vary depending on pre-existing royalties. The Rayrock royalties take effect once 200,000 ounces of gold have been produced from open pit mines on the property. As of March 31, 2012, approximately 103,000 ounces have been produced.
(15)Royalty is capped at $300,000 plus simple interest.
(16)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to under $350-0.0%; $350 to under $400-0.5%; $400 to under $500-1.0%; $500 or higher-2.0%.
(17)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $350-1.0%; above $350-1.5%.
(18)This is a metal stream whereby the purchase price for gold ounces delivered is $435 per ounce, or the prevailing market price of gold, if lower; no inflation.
(19)This is a metal stream whereby Royal Gold is entitled to 12.5% of payable gold until 48,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered; 7.5% thereafter, whereby the purchase price for gold ounces delivered is $450 per ounce on the first 48,000 ounces of gold; $500 per ounce thereafter, or the prevailing market price, if lower.
(20)Gold royalty rate is based on the price of silver per ounce. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of silver per ounce-royalty rate): Below $5.00-0.0%; $5.00 to $7.50-3.778%; >$7.50-9.445%.
(21)The Company's royalty is subject to a 2.0 million ounce cap on gold production. There have been approximately 1.1 million ounces of cumulative production as of March 31, 2013. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $299.99-1.0%; $300 to $324.99-1.50%; $325 to $349.99-2.0%; $350 to $374.99-3.0%; $375 to $399.99-4.0%; $400 or higher-5.0%.
(22)Operator reports reserves by material type. The sulfide material will be processed by milling. The oxide material will be processed by heap leaching.
(23)The royalty rate is 75% until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been produced; 50% thereafter. There have been approximately 155,000 cumulative payable ounces produced as of March 31, 2013. Gold is produced as a by-product of copper.
