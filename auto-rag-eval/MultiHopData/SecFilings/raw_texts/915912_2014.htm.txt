ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ("Development Communities") and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities, and exclude communities owned by the Residual JV. While we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis, we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year.
The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year period to the current year period is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year period. The Company generally establishes the classification of communities as of the beginning of the calendar year; however, in 2014, effective April 1, 2014, the Company updated its classification of communities primarily to include communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in the results of operations of our Established Community portfolio for the balance of the year. The Established Communities for the year ended December 31, 2014 are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2013, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year period. Any discussion of results of operations for the Established Communities for the year ended December 31, 2014 excludes communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The Established Communities as of December 31, 2014, as updated effective April 1, 2014, are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of April 1, 2013, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year period. Established Communities as of December 31, 2014 include most of the stabilized operating communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in, and that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Other Stabilized Communities for the year ended December 31, 2014 include the stabilized operating communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.
•
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's pre-redevelopment basis and is expected to have a material impact on the operations of the community, including occupancy levels and future rental rates.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land, where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community, or where we are the designated developer in a public-private partnership. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
We currently lease our corporate headquarters located in Arlington, Virginia, as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2014, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in, excluding indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, were classified as follows:
____________________________

Reflects the community classification effective April 1, 2014, which includes most stabilized communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in our Established Communities portfolio.
(2)
Metro NY/NJ Established Communities includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater in January 2015.
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
We generally establish the composition of our Established Communities portfolio annually. Determined as of January 1 of each of the respective years, the Established Communities portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, had 23, 19 and 11 communities added, respectively, and six, seven and 17 communities removed, respectively. The Company removes a community from its Established Communities portfolio for the upcoming year (and then generally maintains that designation) if the Company believes that planned activity for a community for the upcoming year will result in that community's expected operations not being comparable to the prior year period. The Company believes that a community's expected operations will not be comparable to the prior year period when it intends either (i) to undertake a significant capital renovation of the community, such that the Company would consider the community to be classified as a Redevelopment Community; or (ii) to dispose of a community through a sale or other disposition transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company removed four, five and 10 communities, respectively, from its Established Communities portfolio due to a reclassification to the Redevelopment Community portfolio on account of then current or expected redevelopment, and removed two, two and seven communities, respectively, from its Established Communities portfolio due to the planned disposition of the communities.
Effective April 1, 2014, the Company updated its operating segments primarily to include communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in the results of operations of our Established Community portfolio for the balance of the year. The Established Communities portfolio as of December 31, 2014 added 43 stabilized communities to the Established Communities portfolio, primarily those acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition, and removed one community from our Established Communities portfolio effective January 1, 2014, due to a reclassification to the Redevelopment Community portfolio.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities include garden-style apartment communities consisting of multi-story buildings in landscaped settings, as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings. As of January 31, 2015, our Current Communities consisted of 142 garden-style (of which 16 are mixed communities and/or include town homes), 21 high-rise and 89 mid-rise apartment communities.
Our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features, which may include:
•
fully-equipped kitchens;
•
lofts and vaulted ceilings;
•
walk-in closets;
•
fireplaces;
•
patios/decks; and
•
modern appliances.
Other features at various communities may include:
•
swimming pools;
•
fitness centers;
•
tennis courts; and
•
wi-fi lounges.
As described in Item 1. "Business," we operate under three core brands Avalon, AVA and Eaves by Avalon. Our core "Avalon" brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services. "AVA" targets customers in high energy, transit-served urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus. "Eaves by Avalon" is targeted to the cost conscious, "value" segment in suburban areas. We believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price.
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service-oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe our mission of Enhancing the Lives of our Residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities, excluding indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, are located in the following geographic markets:
____________________________
(1)
New Jersey Current Communities includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater in January 2015.
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we completed construction of 4,121 apartment homes in 17 communities and sold 3,234 apartment homes in 12 communities. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 19.5 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the weighted average age of our Current Communities is 13.1 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2015, we owned (directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries):
•
a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 225 operating communities, 12 of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in October 2026, November 2028, May 2041, July 2046, December 2061, September 2065, November 2067, April 2095, May 2105, September 2105, April 2106 and March 2142;
•
a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in Fund I, Fund II, the U.S. Fund and the AC JV. Subsidiaries of Fund II own a fee simple interest in 10 operating communities, subsidiaries of the U.S. Fund own a fee simple interest in nine operating communities, and subsidiaries of the AC JV own a fee simple interest in three operating communities;
•
a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a "DownREIT," as described more fully below, that owns one community; and
•
a membership interest in four limited liability companies, that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community.
For some communities, a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration. We have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in October 2026, November 2028 and April 2095.
We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in 24 of the 26 Development Communities and a leasehold interest in two of the Development Communities with the land leases expiring in December 2086 and November 2106. The land lease expiring in 2086 provides an option for the Company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term.
In our partnership structured as a DownREIT, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. Limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Under the partnership agreement for the DownREIT, the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2015, there were 7,500 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities
As of December 31, 2014, we had 26 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 8,524 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $3,011,000,000. In addition, the land for two Development Communities that we control under long-term land lease agreements is subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately $7,704,000 in 2015 in the aggregate. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually, or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (including the factors identified under "Forward-Looking Statements") for further discussion of development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities, unless otherwise noted in the table.
_________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Projected total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
Development community subject to a ground lease.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company completed the development of the following communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Total capitalized cost is as of December 31, 2014. The Company generally anticipates incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments.
(2)
The Company has a 20.0% ownership interest in this community through the AC JV.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2014, there were eight communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $131,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost does not include capitalized costs incurred prior to redevelopment.
(2)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
Development Rights
At December 31, 2014, we had $180,516,000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own, and $67,029,000 in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through an option to purchase or lease the land. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 37 Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of December 31, 2014 includes $144,099,000 in original land acquisition costs. The original land acquisition cost per home ranged from $24,000 per home in Connecticut to $74,000 per home in New York. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 10,384 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.
For 24 Development Rights, we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel. While we generally prefer to hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, for the 13 remaining Development Rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights, for which future development is not yet considered probable, are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2014, we incurred a charge of approximately $3,964,000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed.
You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors," for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The following presents a summary of these Development Rights:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
Land Acquisitions
We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2014 we acquired land parcels for 12 Development Rights, as shown in the table below, for an aggregate investment of approximately $139,685,000.
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land and related acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
Land was acquired through a joint venture in which the Company owns a 70.0% interest.
(3)
In 2014, we acquired this additional parcel of land for the development of Avalon Glendora, expected to have a total of 280 apartment homes for a projected total capitalized cost of $82.5 million.
In January 2015, we acquired land for $325,000,000 associated with three Development Rights located in New York, NY and Bellevue, WA. If developed as expected, the development rights related to this land will contain 910 apartment homes for a projected total capital cost of $509,717,000.
Other Land and Real Estate Assets
We own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately $20,941,000, which we do not currently plan to develop. These parcels consist of (i) land that we originally planned to develop and (ii) ancillary parcels acquired in connection with Development Rights that we had not planned to develop. We believe that the current carrying value for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value, or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired. However, we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value, less costs to dispose.
Disposition Activity
We (i) sell assets when they do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development or redevelopment activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015, we sold our interest in five wholly-owned communities, containing 1,660 apartment homes. The aggregate gross sales price for these assets was $411,700,000.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured and self-insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault and the Hayward Fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. We have in place with respect to communities located in California and Washington, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $150,000,000 of coverage. Earthquake coverage outside of California and Washington is subject to a $175,000,000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate. In California the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building with a maximum of $25,000,000 per loss. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence except that the next $350,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional self-insured retention until the total incurred self-insured retention exceeds $1,500,000. We self-insure a portion of our primary property insurance which includes the earthquake risks.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In December 2007, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back-stop program. Congress reauthorized TRIPRA in January 2015 for six years. We have also purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $400,000,000 including insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIPRA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through TRIPRA (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.
An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and the Company’s related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) that protect the Company, up to $30,000,000 per occurrence, from employee theft of money, securities or property. This amount may not be sufficient to cover losses that may be in excess of the policy limits.
Edgewater Casualty Loss
In January 2015 a fire occurred at our Avalon at Edgewater apartment community located in Edgewater, New Jersey ("Edgewater"). Edgewater consisted of two residential buildings. One building, which contained 240 apartment homes, was destroyed and is uninhabitable. The second building, which contains 168 apartment homes, has been reoccupied and we currently believe it only suffered minimal damage. We are currently assessing our direct losses resulting from the fire, which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild, as well as our liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire. To date, a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us, including three purported class actions. While we currently believe that our direct losses and liability to third parties will be substantially covered by our insurance policies, including coverage for the replacement cost of the building, third party claims, and business interruption loss, subject to deductibles as well as a self-insured portion of the property insurance for which we are obligated for 12% of the first $50,000,000 in losses, we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter.
As of December 31, 2014, Edgewater was encumbered with a fixed-rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 5.95%, and an outstanding principal balance of $75,012,000, due in May 2019 (the “Edgewater Mortgage”). The Edgewater Mortgage stipulates that in the event of a casualty loss such as the Edgewater fire, the lender has absolute discretion to determine the disposition of the insurance proceeds, and can compel us (i) to direct the insurance proceeds to be used for the restoration of Edgewater, or (ii) to apply the insurance proceeds to repay the outstanding loan balance, at par. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we are complying with all lender requirements, and are working with the lender to resolve open issues related to the Edgewater Mortgage.
ITEM 3.
