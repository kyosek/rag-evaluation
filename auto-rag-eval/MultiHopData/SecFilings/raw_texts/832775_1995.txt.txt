Albion, Michigan
The restaurant is located at 118 E. Michigan Avenue. The 3,034 square foot, single-story building was built on a 32,670 square foot parcel in 1990 utilizing a wood frame with brick facing.
Beginning in September 1990, the Partnership did not receive rent payments on the Hardee's restaurants located in Albion, Michigan and St. Johns, Michigan (the "Properties"). As a result of eviction proceedings commenced by the Partnership against the defaulting lessee on January 5, 1991 due to nonpayment of rent, the Partnership obtained legal possession of the Albion property on February 25, 1991 and the St. Johns property on March 18, 1991 and the leases were terminated. Subsequently, Wolverine Fast Food, Inc. ("Wolverine"), the defaulting lessee, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. Upon obtaining possession of the Properties, the Partnership entered into a lease (the "Interim Lease") with an affiliate of the Partnership (the "Affiliated Lessee") until a suitable unaffiliated lessee could be found. Simultaneously, the Partnership entered into negotiations with Hardee's Food Systems, Inc. ("Hardee's"), the franchisor, to manage and operate the Properties until a new franchisee/tenant for the Properties could be located.
During the period that the properties were operated by the Affiliated Lessee, the operating expenses and management fees exceeded the revenues generated by the restaurants. As a result, the Partnership advanced $398,915 to the Affiliated Lessee as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, which was fully reserved in 1993 and written off in 1994.
After taking possession of the Properties, the Partnership, in conjunction with Hardee's, had sought replacement operators for the Properties. During that time, Wolverine approached the Partnership to re-lease the restaurants on a long-term basis. Because the Partnership had been unable to identify another long-term tenant for the restaurants and because Hardee's began to actively support Wolverine and substantial improvement in the performance of the remaining Wolverine restaurants was reported, the Partnership entered into negotiations with Wolverine to re-lease the Properties.
As a result of discussions with Wolverine, the Partnership agreed to lease the Properties to Wolverine, Kenneth Schiefelbein, Barbara Schiefelbein and Jon Guiles, individual principals of Wolverine, for a period of 20 years. The lease term commenced at the St. Johns property on April 1, 1992 and June 1, 1992 at the Albion property. Beginning February 1993, the St. Johns property and beginning July 1993 the Albion property became seriously delinquent
on payments of rent to the Partnership. Although the tenant made irregular rent payments, these delinquencies increased each month throughout the remainder of 1993. In December 1993, Wolverine abandoned the St. Johns property and in January 1994, the Albion property was vacated. On February 2, 1994, the Wolverine petition to the Bankruptcy court was modified from a Chapter 11 to a Chapter 7 filing. In conjunction with the lease negotiations, as well as with the lawsuits filed by the Partnership against Schiefelbein and Guiles, Schiefelbein and Guiles executed agreements with the partnership for non-dischageable debt obligations. A non-dischargeable judgement in the amount of $2.5 million was entered against Schiefelbein and a non-dischargeable judgement in the amount of $1.5 million was entered against Guiles.
The Partnership entered into a lease with a new tenant, Jasaza, Inc., to operate the Albion property as a Hardee's restaurant. The base rent on the property began at a level below the original lease with Wolverine but was to increase each year. In addition, starting in year three of the lease, percentage rents was to be due. On April 8, 1994, the Partnership was notified that Jasaza, Inc., the replacement tenant, was terminating its lease at the Albion Hardee's as of April 12, 1994. The Partnership continues to actively market this property for a replacement tenant.
During the third quarter of 1994, the Partnership recorded an allowance for impairment of $500,000 related to an other than temporary decline in the value of the real estate for the St. Johns, Michigan and Albion, Michigan properties. This allowance has been recorded as a reduction of the properties' cost, and allocated to the land and building based on the original acquisition percentages of 30% (land) and 70% (building).
During the fourth quarter of 1994, the Partnership executed a lease with a Dairy Queen franchisee to be the new tenant at the St. Johns, Michigan property. The lease is for a five year term and commenced February 1, 1995. Base rent is $2,500 per month with monthly percentage rent of 5% due after monthly sales exceed $37,500. The lease provides an option to renew for one five year period. The new lease rent is lower than the rent from the previous tenant.

During 1995 Chi-Chi's, the sub-tenant under the Foodmaker master lease, closed each of its three restaurants owned by the Partnership because they were not profitable. Under the terms of the three leases, Foodmaker, the master tenant and guarantor, is continuing to pay rent for the properties.
Chi-Chi's has undertaken to release the three closed restaurants. In March 1996, a potential sub-tenant executed a second sub-lease with Chi-Chi's for the Charlotte, North Carolina property. This sub-lease is currently being reviewed by both Foodmaker and the Partnership and must be accepted by all three parties before it
becomes effective. Foodmaker will continue to be the guarantor under terms of the second sub-lease.
Foodmaker owns, operates and franchises Jack In The Box, a chain of fast-food restaurants located principally in the western and southwestern United States. Until January 27, 1994, Foodmaker also owned Chi-Chi's, Inc. ("Chi-Chi's"), a chain of full-service, casual Mexican restaurants located primarily in the Midwestern and Midatlantic United States.
For the year ended October 31, 1995, Foodmaker recorded revenues of $1.019 billion from their 863 franchise owned and 389 company owned stores.
The following table summarizes the operations of the Partnership's properties.
Risks of Ownership
The possibility exists that the tenants of the Partnership's properties may be unable to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the terms of their leases, including making base rent or percentage rent payments to the Partnership. Such a default by the tenants or a premature termination of any one of the leases could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Partnership. As discussed in Items 2 and 7, the past tenant in the Partnership's Albion, Michigan and St. Johns, Michigan Hardees' is in default on its leases. The St. Johns, Michigan property has been re-leased at a lower base rent with the new tenant paying for all remodeling and capital improvements needed. The Partnership may be unable to successfully locate a substitute tenant for the Albion, Michigan property due to the fact that the building had been designed or built primarily to house a specific operation. Thus, the Albion, Michigan property and other Partnership properties may not be readily marketable to a new tenant without substantial capital improvements or remodeling. Such improvements may require expenditure of Partnership funds otherwise available for distribution. In addition, because in excess of 30% of the Partnership's cash available for investment has been invested in properties operated as Ponderosa family restaurants, the Partnership is subject to some risk of loss should adverse events affect Ponderosa and in turn adversely affect the Ponderosa lessees' ability to pay rent to the Partnership.
