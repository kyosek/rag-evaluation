Mid-Continent Region. Since 1973 St. Mary has been active in the Mid-Continent region. Operations there are managed by our 35-person Tulsa, Oklahoma office. We have ongoing exploration and development programs in the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma and Texas. The Mid-Continent region accounts for 26 percent of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, or 152.1 BCFE, 85 percent of which were proved developed and 96 percent of which were natural gas. In 2003 our capital expenditures in the Mid-Continent were $72.2 million. We participated in drilling 77 gross wells in this region in 2003, 90 percent of which were completed as producers. We operated 39 of these drilling projects. In addition, we participated in 10 gross recompletions with the same 90 percent success rate.
St. Mary's development and exploration budget in the Mid-Continent region for 2004 totals $59.5 million. We plan to operate 31 drilling wells in the Mid-Continent region during 2004 and to utilize five to seven drilling rigs throughout the year. Our 2004 budget also reflects participation in an additional 16 wells to be operated by other entities.
Anadarko Basin. Our long history of operations and proprietary geologic knowledge enables us to sustain economic development and exploration programs despite periods of adverse industry conditions. We apply state of the art technology in hydraulic fracturing and innovative well completion techniques to accelerate production and associated cash flow from the region's tight gas reservoirs. We also continue to benefit from the continuing consolidation of operators in the basin as we pursue attractive opportunities to acquire properties.
Approximately 77 percent of our 2004 Mid-Continent capital budget is allocated to deeper, higher-potential wells in the Morrow/Springer formations as well as the Atoka formations at the Northeast Mayfield Field in Beckham County, Oklahoma on the southern edge of the Anadarko Basin. The remaining 23 percent of the drilling activities for 2004 will be focused on low-to-medium-risk development in the Cromwell, Granite Wash, Osborne, Red Fork and Spiro formations.
The Northeast Mayfield prospect is the largest concentration of our reserves. This field represents approximately 39 BCFE or seven percent of our proved reserves and $123.5 million, or approximately 10 percent of our total PV-10 value. Our average working interest in this field is 25 percent, and we have an interest in approximately 48 gross wells of which we operate 38 percent.
Other significant fields in the Mid-Continent region are the Centrahoma field located in Coal County, Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin and the Elk City field in Beckham County, Oklahoma. Centrahoma represents three percent of total proved reserves and $41.4 million or three percent of total PV-10 value, and Elk City represents two percent of total proved reserves and $36.0 million of PV-10 value. Here we operate 86 percent and 16 percent of the wells in the respective fields and have an average working interest of approximately 72 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
Rocky Mountain Region. Nance Petroleum Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Mary, has conducted operations in the Williston Basin in eastern Montana and western North Dakota on our behalf since 1991. This area has expanded into the Green River and Wind River basins with properties acquired from Choctaw and Flying J and into the Hanging Woman Basin with our coal-bed methane project. The acquisition of the Flying J properties added approximately 92.0 BCFE of reserves to the Company as of the acquisition date. In total, the Rocky Mountain region accounted for 49 percent of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, or 290.1 BCFE, 95 percent of which were proved developed and 78 percent of which were oil.
Our office in Billings, Montana includes a 58-person staff. A significant portion of the exploration and development in the Rocky Mountain region is based on the interpretation of 3-D seismic data. We have successfully used 3-D seismic imaging to delineate structure and porosity development in the Red River formation.
St. Mary spent $100.3 million on exploration, development and acquisitions in the Williston Basin in 2003. The acquisition of the Flying J properties comprised $68.7 million of our total property acquisitions for the Company. As of the end of 2003, the Flying J properties were producing 2,112 barrels of oil and 7,362 Mcf of gas on a daily basis. In total, the incremental production from the Flying J acquisition in 2003 was 7.3 BCFE.
Our capital budget for the Rocky Mountain region is approximately $63.9 million in 2004. This increase is a result of the increased development of the dolomite portion of the Bakken formation and $12.2 million is dedicated to the development of our coalbed methane project at Hanging Woman Basin. In 2004 we plan to drill 26 conventional operated wells with working interests ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent, with nine of these wells having a working interest greater than 90 percent. We also plan to drill 112 wells in our coalbed methane project at Hanging Woman Basin, all of which we will operate. We will operate projects representing approximately $43.4 million of the total Rocky Mountain budget.
The concentration of our fields is less significant in the Rocky Mountains. The total of the Rough Rider, the Bainville North, Brush Lake and Standard Draw fields represent approximately 47.9 BCFE (7.9 MBOE) or eight percent of our total proved reserves. The PV-10 value represented by these four fields is $90.4 million, approximately 7 percent of our total reserves. Our average working interest varies from a low of 27 percent in the Standard Draw
field to a high of 98 percent in the Brush Lake field.
ArkLaTex Region. Our 18-person office in Shreveport, Louisiana manages St. Mary's operations in the ArkLaTex region. The ArkLaTex region accounts for 11 percent of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, or 67.8 BCFE; 80 percent of which were proved developed and 89 percent of which were natural gas. In 1992, we acquired oil and gas properties and rights to over 6,000 square miles of proprietary 2-D seismic data in the region. Much of the Shreveport office's successful exploration and development programs have derived from niche acquisitions. These acquisitions have provided access to strategic holdings of undeveloped acreage and proprietary packages of geologic and seismic data, resulting in an active program of additional development and exploration.
Our holdings in the ArkLaTex region are comprised of interests in approximately 346 producing gross wells, including 104 wells operated by us; interests in leases totaling approximately 76,400 gross acres; and mineral servitudes totaling approximately 14,300 gross acres. The development of the Huxley field in Shelby County, Texas was the focus of the 2003 activity for the region. This field represents 14.6 BCFE or two percent of the total reserves for the Company. The PV-10 value attributable to the Huxley field is $41.4 million. The Box Church Field located in Limestone County, Texas represents three percent of our proved reserves and two percent of PV-10 value and continues to be a highly profitable area for St. Mary. Production from the Box Church Field in 2003 was 1.3 BCFE.
In 2004 we will continue to focus on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields in which to apply our proprietary geologic models and production techniques. We anticipate participating in 41 gross wells in the ArkLaTex region and will operate 24 of those drilling projects. The total capital expenditures budgeted for the region in 2004 is $21.6 million and will include drilling in the Spider prospect and a mix of exploratory and development programs throughout our prospect inventory.
Gulf Coast Region. St. Mary's presence in south Louisiana dates to the early 1900's when our founders acquired a franchise property in St. Mary Parish on the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. These 24,914 acres of fee lands yielded $4.6 million of gross oil and gas royalty revenue in 2003. Our Gulf Coast region presence increased significantly in 1999 with the acquisition of King Ranch Energy. The Gulf Coast region accounts for six percent of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, or 33.1 BCFE, 94 percent of which were proved developed and 31.1 BCF of which were natural gas.
Our team based in Houston, Texas manages St. Mary's diverse activities in our Gulf Coast and Permian Basin regions. Moving the Gulf Coast operations from Lafayette, Louisiana to Houston is anticipated to be a catalyst for growth for us in the region. Our exploration and development budget in the Gulf Coast region for 2004 is $18.4 million of which 55 percent of these expenditures will be for operated projects.
The most significant field in the Gulf Coast region is the Judge Digby Field, located outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana in Point Coupee Parish. As of the end of December 2003, this field represented slightly more than three percent of our total PV-10 value with 12.6 BCFE of proved reserves. Production from the Judge Digby field totaled 6.5 BCFE in 2003. Production from this field continues to decrease and this area is becoming a smaller component of the value of the Company.
Fee Lands. Since the initial discovery of oil on our fee lands in 1938, our cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowner's royalties, from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle fields have exceeded $245 million. We currently lease 9,945 acres and have granted a seismic option to Seismic Exchange, Inc. on the remaining 14,969 acres. A 3-D seismic shoot over the entire fee land has been concluded and we anticipate receiving the newly shot and processed 3-D seismic early in 2004. These optioned acres are located primarily in the middle portion of our property where little exploration has taken place historically. If the lease option is exercised, the lease will provide us a 25 percent royalty and the option to participate for up to 25 percent as a working interest owner. This working interest election is an individual well-by-well election. We are hopeful this will encourage development drilling by our lessees, facilitate the origination of new prospects and stimulate exploration interest in deeper, untested horizons. However, there can be no assurance that such activities will result. Our principal operators on the fee properties are BP, Cabot and Amerada Hess.
Permian Basin Region. The Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of eastern New Mexico and western Texas and is one of the major producing basins in the United States. The basin includes hundreds of oil fields undergoing secondary and enhanced oil recovery projects. 3-D seismic imaging of existing fields and advanced secondary recovery programs are substantially increasing oil recoveries in the Permian Basin. Our holdings in the Permian Basin resulted from a series of property acquisitions since 1995. We believe that our Permian Basin operations provide us with a solid base of long-lived oil reserves, promising longer-term exploration and development prospects and the potential for secondary recovery projects. The Permian Basin region accounted for nine percent of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, or 50.6 BCFE, of which 70 percent were proved developed and 87 percent were oil.
St. Mary participated in drilling 19 gross wells in 2003 with a 74 percent success rate. The Parkway Delaware water flood project, located in Eddy County, New Mexico represents 19.8 BCFE or three percent of our proved reserves. The East Shugart Delaware Unit is a pilot water flood located in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico that is analogous to the Parkway Delaware Unit. In the fourth quarter of 2003, production increased in response to pilot water flood activities. Proved reserves, primarily related to increased recovery due to the water flood, now total 15.0 BCFE. Production from the Permian Basin properties represented 4 BCFE or five percent of the total production for the Company in 2003.
Our Permian Basin capital budget for 2004 is $10.0 million. We plan to drill four injection wells and perform recompletion work in the East Shugart Delaware waterflood, and we plan to drill six in-fill wells in the Parkway field.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
In addition to the acquisition from Flying J of the oil and gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region, we completed a few smaller niche acquisitions during the past year. In January 2003 we acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in the Ft. Chadbourne field in Coke and Runnels Counties, Texas at a favorable price. Later in the year, we sold our 100 percent working interest ownership in the Ft. Chadbourne field, recognizing a gain on the sale.
In total the acquisitions in 2003 added 112.4 BCFE of proved reserves of which 87 percent was proved developed. In addition to the proved reserves, we acquired significant leasehold acreage in the Flying J acquisition.
The total dispositions of oil and gas properties in 2003 resulted in net proceeds of $23.5 million, and the reserves attributable to the sales were 45.6 BCFE.
Reserves
The following table presents summary information with respect to the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, as prepared by both Ryder Scott Company, independent petroleum engineers, and us. For the periods presented, Ryder Scott Company evaluated properties representing a minimum of 80 percent of our total PV-10 value while we evaluated the remainder. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves owned by St. Mary. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated. You should read the following table along with the sections entitled "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Estimates of oil and gas reserves are not precise."

Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2003, we had working interests in 1,449 gross (737 net) productive oil wells and 1,616 gross (370 net) productive gas wells. Productive wells are either producing wells or wells capable of commercial production although currently shut in. One or more completions in the same wellbore are counted as one well. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced when it first commenced production, and such designation may not be indicative of current production.
Drilling Activity
All of our drilling activities are conducted on a contract basis with independent drilling contractors. We do not own any drilling equipment. The following table sets forth the wells drilled and recompleted in which St. Mary participated during each of the three years indicated:
