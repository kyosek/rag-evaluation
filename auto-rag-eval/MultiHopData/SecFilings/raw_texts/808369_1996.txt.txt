DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
1200 WHIPPLE ROAD is a one-story warehouse/distribution property located in the Hayward-Fremont market area, approximately 25 miles southeast of San Francisco. At December 31, 1996, the property was 100% leased to Broadway Stores, Inc. under a lease which runs through August 2003. The property is described in the March 17 Supplement, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
RICHLAND MALL is a one-level enclosed mall located in Richland Township, Pennsylvania. Tenants include Bon Ton Department Store, Redner's Market, Footlocker, and Radio Shack. At December 31, 1996, the Mall was approximately 95.0% leased with 9,062 square feet vacant. Excluding Bon Ton Department Store and Redner's Market, the two anchor stores, the Mall was 79.3% leased. Leases covering approximately 1.5%, 5.9% and 3.6% of the space are scheduled to expire in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Richland Mall is described in the Partnership's Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 19, 1988 (the "July Report"), which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
Richland Mall has suffered from the continued weakness of the retail sector. Additionally, the current design, which is essentially an enclosed community center, has been unsuccessful in this market. Over the past year, due to a decrease in mall traffic caused by this outdated design, a number of retailers have vacated the center. Additionally, the Clemens Market (25,988 square feet) vacated in November 1996, their lease having expired and their new store having been completed approximately 1 1/2 miles north of Richland. Wal-Mart, which has been attempting to enter this market for the past few years, has received zoning approval and intends to begin construction in April 1997. The Wal-Mart store is expected to open in November 1997.
In an effort to strengthen Richland Mall's position in this market, management has embarked on a plan that will (i) address the physical drawbacks of the center and (ii) enhance tenant mix. Both of these goals, if achieved, are expected to increase the consumer appeal of the center, and thus, sales. The plan consists of three separate parts. The first part consists of releasing the vacant grocery store to a new tenant. This has been accomplished and a lease has been signed with Redner's Market ("Redners"), a regional grocer. Redner's will take the Clemens space of approximately 26,000 square feet and also will take additional mall store space as well as common area, for a total store size of approximately 55,000 square feet. In order to accommodate Redner's, CVS and Radio Shack will be moved to the front of the center. In doing this the remaining tenants will be terminated, leaving the center with two vacant spaces, measuring approximately 28,000 square feet and 19,000 square feet each. The larger space, located at the front of the center, is currently in lease negotiations with Ross Dress for Less, a national discount clothes retailer. The remaining smaller space is located generally behind the proposed Ross store. This space would only be attractive to a service type user, due to its poor visibility and access. Although a lease has been signed with Redner's, the lease is terminable by either Redner's or the landlord if the landlord does not obtain the required permit from the health department. The landlord believes it will obtain the required permit in the near future and that the lease will be binding on both parties.
Upon completion of this project, Richland will no longer be an enclosed community center, as the mall common area will be converted to leased space. The tenant roster is expected to consist of Redner's, Bon-Ton, CVS, Radio Shack and Ross Dress for Less, all of which are strong, credit-worthy tenants with a proven ability to draw customers. The expenses associated with the property are expected to drop substantially upon completion of the project, as there will be no "mall" to clean, heat, and cool. Management believes that this is the best strategy for repositioning the center. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of 1997.

The 16/18 Sentry Park West Property is described in the Partnership's Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 2, 1988, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
701 MAPLE LANE, 733 MAPLE LANE AND 7550 PLAZA COURT are three one-story office/warehouse buildings located in the Chicago metropolitan area. At December 31, 1996, the buildings were 100% leased. Tenants include Triangle Engineered Products, Co., Acme Window Covers and Hi Performance, Inc. These properties are described in the Partnership's Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 27, 1988 (the "December Report"), which is included as an exhibit to this annual report. One lease covering approximately 44.4% of the space is scheduled to expire in 1998.
1850 WESTFORK DRIVE is a one-story warehouse/distribution facility located approximately 15 miles west of the Atlanta central business district. At December 31, 1996 the Property was 100% leased to Treadway Exports Limited ("Treadway"). The lease with Treadway commenced on September 1, 1992 and is for an initial term of three years with two renewal options for a total of an additional three years. On August 30, 1995, Treadway exercised the first renewal option for a term of two years. This lease will expire on August 30, 1997. The 1850 Westfork Drive Property is described in the December Report, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
1345 DOOLITTLE DRIVE is a one-story warehouse/distribution property located in San Leandro, California approximately one mile south of Oakland International Airport.

800 HOLLYWOOD AVENUE is a one-story warehouse/office building located in Itasca, Illinois. The building contains 2,500 rentable square feet of office space and 47,837 rentable square feet of warehouse space. The property is 100% leased to Concentric, Inc. through May 31, 2002. The lease requires the tenant to pay 100% of real estate taxes, insurance, and certain maintenance costs.
NORTHLAND CENTER, which was transferred to the Venture and Equitable by a deed in lieu of foreclosure on July 22, 1994, is a regional enclosed mall located in Southfield, Michigan. Tenants include Hudson's Department Store, J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward and Target. As of December 31, 1996, the Center was approximately 79.9% leased (excluding the anchor stores). Leases covering approximately 2.3%, 15.6% and 2.2% of the space (excluding the anchor stores) are scheduled to expire in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
On March 17, 1995, Equitable, the Venture and Dayton Hudson Corporation signed an agreement allowing Target to locate a store at Northland. Target is a division of Dayton Hudson, which currently operates a Hudson's Department Store at Northland. Equitable and the Venture agreed to expend funds in the amount of $1,700,000 (of which the Venture's share was approximately $1,200,000) to ready a site for the Target store and to partially demolish the Kohl's store and redemise the remaining portion of Kohl's into mall shops. Target built its own store, which opened in April 1996.
Competitive conditions in the retail industry in general and shopping malls in particular have remained difficult. The Venture has tried to reposition its shopping malls to take advantage of the changing demographics of retail customers. However, given the continuing competitive difficulties in the retail industry, the Venture may be unable to sell its shopping malls at favorable prices within the next few years.
THE BANK OF DELAWARE BUILDING, which was transferred to the Venture by deed in lieu of foreclosure on November 15, 1994, is a seventeen story office building in Wilmington, Delaware. PNC Bank, a major tenant, occupies 102,808 square feet, or 32.7% of the building. PNC's lease expires in May 2005 and contains an option to renew. PNC's rent is substantially below market rates. As of December 31, 1996, the building was approximately 52.3% leased. Over the past year, management has removed asbestos from a number of the vacant floors in the building. Currently, approximately 34,000 square feet of the 149,802 square feet of vacant space still contain asbestos, removal of which is scheduled for 1997. The majority of deferred maintenance has been corrected, and thus contemplated capital expenditures in 1997 will generally be for asbestos abatement, tenant improvements in connection with actual leasing and leasing commissions. Leases covering approximately 1.0%, 0.2% and 3.7% are scheduled to expire in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Management has established an enhancement/stabilization and renovation program for the Bank of Delaware building. See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further information regarding this renovation program.
BROOKDALE CENTER, which was transferred to the Venture and Equitable on December 16, 1996, is a regional shopping mall located approximately five miles northwest of the central business district of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Anchor stores include J.C. Penney, Sears, Mervyn's, Dayton's and Kohl's. As of December 31, 1996, Brookdale Center was approximately 69.5% leased (excluding the anchor stores). Leases covering approximately 4.5%, 5.1% and 4.5% of the space are scheduled to expire in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. See "-- Mortgage Loans Pursuant to Which the Venture Acquired Properties" for a discussion of the events leading to Equitable and the Venture's acquisition of Brookdale Center.
Management took possession of Brookdale Center on December 16, 1996, and is currently evaluating future strategies with respect to the mall. The ground lease and operating covenant for Dayton's, a major department store and one of the mall anchors, has expired. The operating covenant for Sears, another anchor tenant, expires in May 1997. While neither of these tenants has indicated a desire to leave the center, substantial capital expenditures could be required to obtain new ground leases/covenants from these tenants. Management is also evaluating a renovation of the mall common area and a plan to retenant the approximately 30% mall store vacancy. No definitive course of action has been decided upon. A comprehensive plan for this property should be complete in the second or third quarter of 1997.
OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE LOAN
JERICHO VILLAGE LOAN is a first mortgage loan to the Wilcon Company secured by an apartment complex in Weston, Massachusetts. Interest-only payments on the loan in the amount of $51,250 are due monthly in arrears during the term of the loan, with the full principal amount of the loan due upon maturity of the loan on February 1, 1999.

At December 31, 1996, the property was approximately 99% leased. The Jericho Village Loan and the property which secures it are described in the December Report, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
MORTGAGE LOANS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE VENTURE ACQUIRED PROPERTIES
NORTHLAND ZERO NOTE was a first mortgage note secured by Northland Center, a regional enclosed mall which is located outside of Detroit, Michigan. The Venture acquired its 71.66% participation interest in 1988 from Equitable which held the remaining 28.34% interest. The Venture's participation interest had an estimated fair market value (including accrued interest) at the time of acquisition of $20,774,985. The borrower was Midwest. The note had an implicit interest rate of 10.2% compounded semiannually with the Venture's portion of the principal and accrued interest totaling $42,882,504 due June 30, 1995. The note provided that the borrower could elect to pay interest currently; however, no interest was paid through July 22, 1994.
Management discontinued the accrual of interest on the Northland note during the quarter ended June 30, 1993 as the accreted value of the mortgage approximated the estimated fair market value of the Northland Center. The Northland mortgage note and first mortgage were accounted for as an in-substance foreclosure at December 31, 1993, and the zero mortgage note was reclassified as an other real estate asset. The Venture recognized a loss of $7,628,000 as of December 31, 1993 to record Northland Center at its estimated fair market value. This amount included $4,730,000 reserved by the Venture as its share of the $6.6 million to be paid to Midwest on the transfer of Northland Center.
On July 22, 1994, Midwest transferred Northland Center to the Venture and Equitable in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the Northland mortgage. Following the transfer which was retroactive as of January 1, 1994, Northland Center was reclassified from other real estate assets to rental properties and income and expenses were recorded from that date. The Venture records its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the undivided interests in the Northland Center in accordance with the tenancy in common arrangements set forth in the Participation Agreement dated September 27, 1988 between the Venture and Equitable, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report. The Venture and Equitable paid the owner $6.6 million at the time of transfer (an amount which was determined to approximate the net present value of the anticipated cash flow from Northland Center, subject to closing adjustments, for the period from January 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995, the date the Northland mortgage would have matured).
For additional information concerning the Northland Note, reference is made to the information under "REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS -- The Zero Notes" and "REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT -- Brookdale and Northland Zero Notes" in the Prospectus, "REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS -- The Zero Notes" in the March 17 Supplement, and Note 1 to Notes to Financial Statements to the Partnership's Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q for the Quarter ended June 30, 1988, all of which information are included as exhibits to this annual report.
BANK OF DELAWARE BUILDING LOAN was a first mortgage loan secured by a 17-story office building in the Wilmington central business district. The owners of The Bank of Delaware Building defaulted on the mortgage loan receivable and the Venture accounted for the transaction as an in-substance foreclosure at December 31, 1993. Accordingly, the mortgage loan receivable was reclassified to other real estate assets at its estimated fair market value as of that date and the Venture began recording operating revenues and expenses of the building. In the third quarter of 1994, the Venture recognized a loss of $1,000,000 due to valuing The Bank of Delaware Building at the most recent estimated fair market value. Subsequently, on November 15, 1994, the Venture acquired title to The Bank of Delaware Building by a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In connection with the deed in lieu transaction, the Venture received a $350,000 cash payment plus the property's operating cash account, which reduced the loss on the transaction to approximately $380,000.
BROOKDALE ZERO NOTE was a first mortgage note secured by Brookdale Center, a regional shopping mall located approximately five miles northwest of the central business district of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Venture acquired its 71.66% participation interest in 1988 from Equitable which held the remaining 28.34% interest. The Venture's participation interest had a fair value (including accrued interest) at the time of acquisition of $12,278,885. The borrower was Midwest. The note had an implicit interest rate of 10.2% compounded semiannually, with the Venture's portion of the principal and accrued interest totaling $25,345,353 due June 30, 1995.
Management discontinued the accrual of interest relating to the Brookdale note beginning with the second quarter of 1995 as the accreted value of the mortgage approximated the estimated fair market value of the Brookdale Center. The Venture's share of the note plus accrued interest at the time was $24,730,409.
An internal review of the property, performed for the Venture as of September 30, 1995, estimated the fair market value of Brookdale Center to be $30,000,000. The Venture recorded a valuation allowance of $3,232,210 to value its interest in the Brookdale Zero Note at an amount equal to the Venture's participation interest in the note multiplied by the estimated fair market value of the Center, or $21,498,199. This valuation allowance was presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a decrease in assets and partners' capital and on the consolidated statements of operations as a provision for impairment on zero coupon mortgage. See "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."
On December 16, 1996, Brookdale Center was transferred to the Venture and Equitable, as tenants in common pursuant to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan for Midwest that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on November 25, 1996. The consideration for this transfer was (i) release of Midwest from its obligations under the Brookdale zero coupon note and (ii) payment to Midwest of $500,000, of which the Venture's portion was $358,303. An internal review of the property, performed for the Venture as of the date of transfer, estimated the fair market value of Brookdale Center to be $21,700,000, of which Venture's portion was $15,550,364. Following the transfer, Brookdale Center was reclassified from zero coupon mortgage note receivable to rental properties and income and expenses were recorded from that date. The Venture recognized a loss of $6,211,644 to record Brookdale Center at its estimated fair market value. The Venture records its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the undivided interest in Brookdale Center in accordance with the Participation Agreement dated March 3, 1988 between the Venture and Equitable, as amended on March 10, 1988, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report.
