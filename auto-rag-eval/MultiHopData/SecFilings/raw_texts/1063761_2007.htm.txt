Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet centers, The Mills Â®, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 242 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 150.8 million square feet. Total estimated retail sales at the properties in 2007 were approximately $60 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 168 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.3 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 675 anchors, which are mostly national retailers.
Premium Outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturers' outlet centers. Our 38 Premium Outlet centers range in size from approximately 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet centers are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco; or within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
The Mills portfolio consists of Mills centers, regional malls, and community centers. The 17 Mills centers generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA. The Mills centers are located in major metropolitan areas and have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The 16 regional malls typically range in size from 700,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers. The four community centers are adjacent to Mills centers, and contain a mix of big box and other local and national retail tenants.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 67 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 900,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other tenants that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets. These tenants generally occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 10 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 300,000 square feet of GLA and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

We own 100% of 198 of our properties, effectively control 19 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 103 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 310 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

Our properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan, primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.
Other International Investments
We also hold real estate interests in six joint ventures in Japan, one in Mexico, and one in South Korea. The six joint ventures in Japan operate Premium Outlet centers in various cities in Japan and are held in joint ventures with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. and Sojitz Corporation (formerly known as Nissho Iwai Corporation). These centers have over 1.6 million square feet of GLA and were all 100% leased as of December 31, 2007. They contain 600 stores with approximately 300 different tenants. The Premium Outlet center in Mexico is 88% leased as of December 31, 2007, and the Premium Outlet center in South Korea is 100% leased as of December 31, 2007.

FOOTNOTES:
(1)All gross leasable area listed in square feet. (2)This property is held partially in fee and partially encumbered by a leasehold on the premise which entitles the lessor to the majority of the economics of the portion of the property subject to the leasehold. (3)These properties are encumbered by a leasehold on the entire premises which entitles the lessor the majority of the economics of the property (4)Represents the sales area of the anchor and excludes any warehouse/storage areas. (5)On April 4, 2007, Gallerie Commerciali Italia (the Italian joint venture in which the Company owns a 49% interest) acquired the remaining 60% interest in the shopping gallery at this center, which consists of 177,600 square feet of leasable area. The Company owns a 19.6% interest in the retail parks at this center, which consist of 446,900 square feet of leasable area.
Land Held for Development
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in four parcels of land held in the United States for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately 300 acres located in three states.
Also, on December 28, 2005, we invested $50.0 million of equity for a 40% interest in a joint venture with Toll Brothers, Inc. and Meritage Homes Corp. to purchase a 5,485-acre land parcel in northwest Phoenix from DaimlerChrysler Corporation for $312 million. The principal use of the land upon attaining entitled status is the development of single-family homesites by our partners. As a result of the recent downturn in the residential market, during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded an impairment charge of $55.1 million, $35.6 million net of tax benefit, representing our entire investment in this joint venture entity, including interest capitalized on our invested equity.
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency
Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, the absolute corporate energy use for operations under our control (which excludes electricity consumed by our tenants) has decreased by 9.7% from 2003 to 2007. The 102 million kilowatt-hours decrease in energy use for this four-year period reduced related annual CO2 emissions by over 67,932 tons. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered annually by 15,439 acres of pine or fir forests and to approximately $11.0 million in avoided annual operating costs.
We were awarded NAREIT's Leader in the Light Gold Award for the second year in a row and have been named 2008 "Energy Partner of the Year" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We were the first real estate company in the S&P 500 and the first retail property REIT to win this award.
