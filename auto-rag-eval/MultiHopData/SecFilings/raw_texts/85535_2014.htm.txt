ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have royalty or streaming interests and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage royalties and streams, as well their respective reserves, are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have royalties, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The description of our principal royalties and streams set forth below includes the location, operator, royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Royalties on Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such royalty interests are no longer principal to our business. Currently,
the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically) to be principal to our business.
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
We own a royalty on all gold produced from the sulfide portion of the Andacollo copper and gold deposit. The Andacollo royalty equals 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the deposit at the Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold, and 50% of the gold produced in excess of 910,000 payable ounces of gold. As of June 30, 2014, approximately 217,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold.
Andacollo is an open-pit copper mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo ("Teck"). Andacollo is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo project by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Reported production at Andacollo decreased approximately 27% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The decrease in reported production is due to lower grades as expected in the mine plan. Teck continues to expect a lower calendar year 2014 grade profile, with gold production for the year at Andacollo anticipated to be weighted toward the second half of calendar 2014.
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a large open-pit and underground mine, utilizing mill and heap leach processing. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline, South Pipeline, part of the Gap pit and Crossroads deposits which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)Reserve Claims ("GSR1"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the "Reserve Claims," which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR royalty rate on the Reserve Claims is tied to the gold price as shown in the table below and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation.
(b)GAS Claims ("GSR2"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the "GAS Claims," which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR royalty rate on the GAS Claims, as shown in the table below, is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation.
(c)Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty ("GSR3"). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)Net Value Royalty ("NVR1"). This is a fixed 1.25% NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. The Company owns 81.098% of the 1.25% NVR (or 1.014%) while limited partners in the partnership, which is consolidated in our financial statements, own the remaining portion of the 1.25% NVR. A 0.618% portion of our NVR1 royalty covers the mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
The following shows the current sliding-scale GSR1 and GSR2 royalty rates under our royalty agreement with Cortez:
Reported production at Cortez increased approximately 16% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as surface mining activity at the Pipeline and Gap pits increased during the current period. Additionally, after deferrals in the first half of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, Barrick resumed shipments of roaster ore stockpiled at Cortez to Goldstrike for processing, which occurred during the March 2014 quarter.
Holt (Ontario, Canada)
We own a sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Holt portion of the Holloway-Holt mining project located in Ontario, Canada and owned 100% by St Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ("St Andrew"). The Holloway-Holt project straddles Ontario Provincial Highway 101 for approximately 25 miles beginning east of Matheson, Ontario, Canada and extending to the Quebec, Canada border. The sliding-scale NSR royalty rate on gold produced from the Holt portion of the mining project is derived by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. For example, at a quarterly average gold price of $1,300 per ounce, the effective royalty rate payable would be 16.9%.
Reported production at Holt increased 12% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Although production at Holt increased, our royalty rate and corresponding revenue decreased due to the decrease in gold price. St Andrew credited additional mine infrastructure and mine development for the operational improvements.
Mt. Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
RGLD Gold, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns the right to purchase 52.25% of the payable gold produced from the Mt. Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by Thompson Creek. The cash purchase price is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price. The Mt. Milligan project is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mt. Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mt. Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Thompson Creek reported that the mine reached commercial production, defined as operating the mill at 60% of design capacity for 30 days, on February 18, 2014. The ramp-up at Mt. Milligan continues to progress well with mine pit grades and metal recoveries as expected, and mill throughput steadily improving. Thompson Creek expects mill throughput will achieve 75% to 85% of design capacity by the end of calendar year 2014. In August 2014, Thompson Creek announced that estimated calendar 2014 gold production will be between 185,000 and 195,000 ounces of gold compared to earlier guidance of 165,000 and 175,000 ounces of gold.
Deliveries of gold to RGLD Gold are a product of the gold ounces contained in concentrates from Mt. Milligan, a 97% payable factor, and our 52.25% stream interest; and, for the first 12 concentrate shipments from Mt. Milligan, are based on Thompson Creek's receipt of provisional payments under each of its concentrate sales agreements. For shipments 1-4, 75% of the gold is delivered based upon Thompson Creek's receipt of the provisional payment under each concentrate sales agreement and 25% of the gold ounces are delivered based upon final settlement under each agreement. For shipments 5-8, those percentages are 50% and 50%, respectively, and for shipments 9-12, the percentages are 25% and 75%, respectively. Thereafter, all deliveries to RGLD Gold will be based solely on final settlement timing and volumes under Thompson Creek's concentrate sales agreements.
Gold deliveries to RGLD Gold can be affected by several factors that make it difficult to calculate our quarterly Mt. Milligan revenue based solely on Thompson Creek's reported quarterly production. These factors include the timing of Thompson Creek's concentrate shipments, and the provisional and final settlement terms applicable to each shipment, neither of which are known to RGLD Gold prior to the shipment date. RGLD Gold receives physical metal within two days after Thompson Creek records a sale, which in turn can take between five days and several weeks post-shipment. RGLD Gold currently sells most of the delivered gold within three weeks of receipt, and recognizes revenue on its streaming transactions when the metal received is sold.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, RGLD Gold purchased 25,750 ounces of physical gold, which came from a combination of provisional and final settlements associated with the first seven shipments of concentrate from Mt. Milligan. RGLD Gold sold approximately 21,100 ounces of gold during our fiscal year 2014 at an average price of $1,292 per ounce, and had approximately 7,800 ounces of gold in inventory as of June 30, 2014. Of the approximately 7,800 ounces of gold in inventory as of June 30, 2014, approximately 3,100 ounces were received but not yet purchased from Thompson Creek per the stream agreement. The Company purchased these ounces on July 2, 2014.
Mulatos (Sonora, Mexico)
We own a 1.0% to 5.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Mulatos open-pit mine and heap leach operation in southeastern Sonora, Mexico. The Mulatos mine is located approximately 137 miles east of the city of Hermosillo and 186 miles south of the border with the United States and is operated by a subsidiary of Alamos Gold, Inc. ("Alamos"). Access to the mine from the city of Hermosillo is available via private chartered flight or ground transportation on a paved and gravel road.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based on the gold price as shown in the following table:
The Mulatos royalty is capped at 2.0 million gold ounces of production. As of June 30, 2014, approximately 1.27 million cumulative ounces of gold have been produced.
Reported production at Mulatos decreased approximately 31% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Alamos reported that the decrease in production was primarily attributable to lower than expected grades from the Escondida deposit. Alamos commenced underground mining at Escondida Deep during the March 2014 quarter and expects to transition to San Carlos in the second half of calendar 2014. Underground throughput rates at San Carlos are expected to gradually ramp-up to mill capacity of 800 tonnes per day in the second half of calendar 2014.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp. The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile
Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Reported production for gold at Peñasquito increased approximately 44% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Reported production for silver, lead and zinc also increased when compared to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Goldcorp reported that it is mining in the higher grade portion of the pit, which it expects will continue throughout calendar 2014 at a projected throughput of 110,000 tonnes per day.
Robinson Mine (Nevada, USA)
We own a 3.0% NSR royalty on all mineral production from the Robinson open-pit mine operated by a subsidiary of KGHM International Ltd. ("KGHM"). Access to the property is via Nevada State Highway 50, 6.5 miles west of Ely, Nevada, in White Pine County.
Reported copper production at Robinson decreased approximately 52% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, while reported gold production decreased approximately 44% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The lower production was due to the planned mine sequence moving to the Kimbley pit, which has lower metal grades. It is expected that mining will return to the higher grade Ruth pit in the second half of calendar 2014.
Voisey's Bay (Labrador, Canada)
Labrador Nickel Royalty Limited Partnership ("LNRLP"), of which the Company is the indirect 90% owner, holds a 3.0% NSR royalty (or an effective 2.7% NSR royalty for the Company interest) on the Voisey's Bay nickel-copper-cobalt mine located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and operated by Vale Newfoundland & Labrador Limited ("Vale"). A non-controlling interest owns the remainder of LNRLP. The Voisey's Bay project is located on the northeast coast of Labrador, on a peninsula bordered to the north by Anaktalak Bay and to the south by Voisey's Bay. The property is 560 miles north-northwest of St. John's, the capital of the Province. Access to the property is primarily by helicopter or small aircraft.
In October 2009, LNRLP stated a claim in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador Trial Division against certain subsidiaries of Vale, alleging that Vale has been incorrectly calculating LNRLP's 3% NSR royalty on the sale of nickel and copper concentrates from the Voisey's Bay mine. Vale is commissioning its new Long Harbour Processing Plant with nickel matte from its Indonesian operations and intends to begin introducing nickel concentrates from Voisey's Bay in coming quarters. In anticipation of the transition from processing Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates at Vale's Sudbury and Thompson smelters to processing at the Long Harbour hydrometallurgical plant, the Company is engaged in discussions with Vale concerning calculation of the royalty once Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates are processed at Long Harbour. Vale proposed a calculation of the royalty that the Company estimates could result in the substantial reduction of royalty payable to LNRLP on Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates processed at Long Harbour. While the Company may continue to engage in discussions concerning calculation of the royalty on nickel concentrates processed at Long Harbour, there is no guaranty that the Company and Vale will reach agreement on the proper calculation under the terms of the royalty agreement. If no agreement is reached, the Company intends to vigorously pursue all legal remedies to ensure the appropriate calculation of the royalty and to enforce LNRLP's royalty interests at Voisey's Bay.
Reported nickel production at Voisey's Bay decreased approximately 14% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and reported copper production decreased approximately 21% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.
Principal Royalties on Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal royalty interest in the development stage. Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
We own a 0.78% to 5.23% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. The Company owns an additional royalty equivalent to 1.05% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick's operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interest is applicable to all gold production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million, (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) we also increased our interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note: Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
Pascua-Lama is one of the world's largest gold and silver deposits with nearly 18 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, 676 million ounces of silver contained within the gold reserves, and an expected mine life of 25 years. It is expected to produce an average of 800,000-850,000 ounces of gold and 35 million ounces of silver annually during its first full five years of operation.
During the fourth quarter of calendar 2013, Barrick announced the temporary suspension of construction at Pascua-Lama, except for activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance. The ramp-down is on schedule for completion by mid-2014 and the majority of demobilization has already occurred. Barrick reports that it will incur costs of about $300 million during calendar 2014 for the ramp-down and environmental and social obligations.
According to Barrick, a decision to restart development will depend on improved economics and reduced uncertainty related to legal and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the timing of any such decision to restart, permitting timelines, construction schedule and timing of first production are uncertain. Once a decision to restart is taken, remaining development will take place in distinct stages with specific work programs and budgets to facilitate more efficient execution and improved cost control.
Reserve Information
Table 1 below summarizes proven and probable reserves for gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, cobalt and molybdenum that are subject to our royalty interests as of December 31, 2013, as reported to us by the operators of the mines. Properties are currently in production unless noted as development ("DEV") within the table. The exploration royalties we own do not contain proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2013. Please refer to pages 33-35 for the footnotes to Table 1.

As of December 31, 2013(1)
(1)Reserves have been reported by the operators of record as of December 31, 2013, with the exception of the following properties: Red Dam-February 28, 2014; Svetloye-January 1, 2014; Gwalia Deeps, King of the Hills, Kundip, South Laverton-June 30, 2013; Don Mario-June 1, 2013; Schaft Creek and Williams-December 31, 2012; Soledad-September 6, 2012; Southern Cross-June 30, 2012; Pinson-May 18, 2012; Tulsequah Chief-March 15, 2012; Don Nicolas, Gold Hill, Johnson Camp, Pascua-Lama, Robinson and Wolverine-December 31, 2011; Mara Rosa-October 28, 2011; Balcooma-June 30, 2011; Kutcho Creek-February 15, 2011; Pine Cove-June 30, 2010; and Caber-July 18, 2007.
(2)Gold reserves were calculated by the operators at the following per ounce prices: $1,500-Williams; $1,450-Kundip; A$1,400-Celtic/Wonder North, South Laverton and Southern Cross; $1,366-Schaft Creek; $1,350-El Limon, El Morro, El Toqui and Tulsequah Chief; $1,310-Soledad; A$1,310-Red Dam; $1,300-Canadian Malartic, Dolores, Holt, Leeville, Peñasquito, Pinson, Svetloye, Twin Creeks and Wharf; A$1,300-Meekatharra (Nannine, Paddy's Flat; Reedys and Yaloginda); $1,250-Back River, Martha, Mulatos and Taparko; A$1,250-Gwalia Deeps and King of the Hills; $1,200-Gold Hill and Pascua-Lama; $1,100-Andacollo, Bald Mountain, Cortez, Don Mario, Don Nicolas, Goldstrike, Mara Rosa and Ruby Hill; $1,000-Robinson; $950-Inata; $983-Pine Cove; and $690-Mt. Milligan. No gold price was reported for Balcooma, Caber, Kutcho Creek, Marigold or Wolverine.
(3)Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Reserve" is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. "Proven (Measured) Reserves" are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established.
"Probable (Indicated) Reserves" are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
(4)Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(5)The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)"Contained ounces" or "contained pounds" do not take into account recovery losses in mining and processing the ore.
(7)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $375-1.75%; >$375 to $400-2.0%; >$400 to $425-2.25%; >$425-2.5%.

(10)The royalty is capped at $10 million. As of June 30, 2014, royalty payments of approximately $1.7 million have been received.
(11)The 1.0% to 2.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty will pay 2.0% when the price of gold is above $350 per ounce and 1.0% when the price of gold falls to $350 per ounce or below. The 0.6% to 0.9% NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $300-0.6%; $300 to $350-0.7%; > $350 to $400-0.8%; > $400-0.9%. The silver royalty rate is based on the price of gold.
(12)The 0.6% to 0.9% sliding-scale NSR applies to the M-ACE claims. The operator did not break out reserves or resources subject to the M-ACE claims royalty.
(13)Royalty only applies to Section 29 which currently holds about 95% of the reserves reported for the property. An additional Cordilleran royalty applies to a portion of Section 28.
(14)Royalty only applies to Section 29 which currently holds about 95% of the reserves reported for the property. Additional Rayrock royalties apply to Sections 28, 32 and 33; these royalty rates vary depending on pre-existing royalties. The Rayrock royalties take effect once 200,000 ounces of gold have been produced from open pit mines on the property. As of June 30, 2014, approximately 103,000 ounces have been produced.
(15)Royalty is capped at $300,000 plus simple interest.
(16)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to under $350-0.0%; $350 to under $400-0.5%; $400 to under $500-1.0%; $500 or higher-2.0%.

(21)This is a metal stream whereby Royal Gold is entitled to 12.5% of payable gold until 48,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered; 7.5% thereafter, whereby the purchase price for gold ounces delivered is $450 per ounce on the first 48,000 ounces of gold; $500 per ounce thereafter, or the prevailing market price, if lower.
(22)Gold royalty rate is based on the price of silver per ounce. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of silver per ounce-royalty rate): Below $5.00-0.0%; $5.00 to $7.50-3.778%; >$7.50-9.445%.
(23)The Company's royalty is subject to a 2.0 million ounce cap on gold production. There have been approximately 1.27 million ounces of cumulative production as of June 30, 2014. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $299.99-1.0%; $300 to $324.99-1.50%; $325 to $349.99-2.0%; $350 to $374.99-3.0%; $375 to $399.99-4.0%; $400 or higher-5.0%.
(24)Operator reports reserves by material type. The sulfide material will be processed by milling. The oxide material will be processed by heap leaching.
(25)The royalty rate is 75% until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been produced; 50% thereafter. There have been approximately 217,000 cumulative payable ounces produced as of June 30, 2014. Gold is produced as a by-product of copper.
(26)The royalty covers approximately 30% of the La Fortuna deposit. Reserves attributable to Royal Gold's royalty represent approximately 3/7 of Goldcorp's reporting of 70% of the total reserve.
(27)All metals are paid based on zinc prices. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of zinc per pound-royalty rate): Below $0.50-0.0%; $0.50 to below $0.55-1.0%; $0.55 to below $0.60-2.0%; $0.60 or higher-3.0%.
(28)Royalty applies to all gold production from an area of interest in Chile. Only that portion of the reserves pertaining to our royalty interest in Chile is reflected here. Approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to the first 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project.
