ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
Petroleum and Natural Gas Properties
Gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation and development company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects primarily in the Rocky Mountain Region. Gasco's strategy is to enhance stockholder value by using new technologies to generate high-potential exploitation prospects in this area. The Company's principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights, either directly or indirectly, and the exploitation and development of properties subject to these leases.
Riverbend Project
The Riverbend Project comprises approximately 119,259 gross acres in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah, of which Gasco hold interests in approximately 46,796 net acres as of December 31, 2003. The Company can also earn interests in approximately 19,324 gross acres in this area under farm-out and other agreements. The Company's engineering and geologic focus is concentrated on three tight-sand formations in the Uinta basin: the Wasatch, Mesaverde and Blackhawk formations. In January 2002, we entered into an agreement with Halliburton Energy Services under which Halliburton had the option to earn a participation interest proportionate to its investment by funding the completion of wells in the Wasatch and Mesaverde formations. Halliburton elected to participate in two of the wells and declined to participate in the remaining three wells in this area. The agreement was terminated during October 2003.
During 2002 Gasco drilled three operated wells, which are currently producing. Gasco's share of the costs for each of the first two wells were approximately $1,050,000 and $1,312,000 and the costs for the third well, were approximately $2,340,000. Recompletions for two of these wells took place during November 2003. Gasco's fourth operated well in this area reached total depth during December 2002 and was completed during November 2003. The drilling and completion costs for this well, net to Gasco's interest were approximately $2,700,000. Gasco's fifth operated well in this area was spudded in October 2002 with a small rig that was moved off the drill site. A larger rig was moved onto the site in March 2003 to complete the drilling of this well, and the well was completed during November 2003. The total costs for this well, net to Gasco's interest were approximately $2,200,000.
In addition to the Gasco-operated wells described above, the Company also owns a 14% to 20% working interest in five wells and an overriding royalty interest in one well that were drilled by ConocoPhillips in this area during late 2001 and through the fourth quarter of 2002. All of these wells are capable of producing and selling gas. On March 9, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of ConocoPhillips' interests in these producing wells, 13,062 net acres and certain other assets located in the Uinta Basin in Utah for approximately $3,175,000. The Company also became the operator of these properties effective January 1, 2004. Pursuant to an existing contract an unrelated third party has the right to purchase 25% of the acquired properties at the acquisition price within 30 days following the acquisition date.
During October 2003, the Company completed a transaction whereby it settled an outstanding amount owed of $1,606,982 to an oilservice provider arising from drilling and completion expenditures on five Gasco-operated wells, by paying the provider $400,000 in cash and conveying to the provider a portion of its interests in two Riverbend wells. Subsequent to the transaction, the Company retained a 30% working interest in the two subject wells and the ownership in remaining three wells is unchanged.
During January 2003, Gasco entered into a contract with the system operator to put a new compressor into place in the Riverbend Project. The installation of this compressor was completed during February 2003. The additional compression capacity has allowed the Company to begin producing from wells that were shut-in
or flowing though constricted orifices and should meet the Company's projected compression needs in this project through the first half of 2004.
On January 16, 2004 the Company entered into agreements with a group of industry providers (together, the "Service Parties") to accelerate the development of Gasco's oil and gas properties by drilling up to 50 wells in Gasco's Riverbend Project in Utah's Uinta Basin. Two of the Company's wells that were completed in November, as discussed above, were made a part of this agreement. Gasco has agreed that the Service Parties, which includes Schlumberger Oilfield Services, will have the exclusive right to provide their services in the development of the Riverbend acreage during the term of the agreement. The agreement provides for the group to initially proceed with the first 10-well bundle, which approximates one year of drilling with a single rig. If the group agrees, drilling may be accelerated using additional rigs. Gasco's 2004 capital budget is approximately $13 million for the drilling, completion and pipeline connection of wells in this area. Gasco may elect to fund up to 20% of the cost of the wells in the first three bundles and up to 30% in the last two bundles. Gasco's interest in the production stream from a bundle, net of royalties, taxes and lease operating expenses is estimated to equal the proportion of the total well costs that it funds.
To secure its obligations under the agreement, described above, the Company has pledged its interests in each of the wells in each bundle.
Greater Green River Basin Project
In Wyoming, Gasco established an AMI with Burlington Resources ("Burlington") covering approximately 330,000 acres in Sublette County, Wyoming within the Greater Green River Basin. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has a leasehold interest in approximately 112,582 gross acres and 62,614 net acres in this area. During 2002, the Company participated in the drilling of a two wells in this AMI. Gasco has a 31.5% interest in each of these wells.
Three shallow wells were drilled during 2001 in this area for the purpose of holding acreage and earning expiring leasehold. All of these wells have been cased and are in various stages of completion, however none of these are currently producing.
On May 1, 2002, the Company issued 9,500,000 shares of its common stock to the Shama Zoe Limited Partnership ("Shama Zoe"), a private oil and gas company, for the acquisition of 53,095 gross (47,786 net) acres plus other assets and consideration in the Greater Green River Basin in Sublette County Wyoming. The acquisition was valued at $18,525,000 using a stock price of $1.95 per common share, which represented the closing price of the Company's common stock on April 23, 2002; the date the agreement was executed. The original Property Purchase Agreement governing this transaction prevented the Company from issuing additional shares of its common stock at prices below $1.80 per share and from granting registration rights in connection with the issuance of shares of its common stock. In connection with the August 14, 2002 issuance of 6,500,000 shares of common stock, the original Property Purchase Agreement was amended to allow for the issuance of those shares at a price of $1.00 per share and Shama Zoe was granted an option to sell to the Company 1,400,000 shares of the Gasco common stock that it acquired in the transaction at $1.00 per share at any time prior to December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002 Shama Zoe exercised the option
and sold 1,400,000 shares of Gasco common stock back to the Company for $1.00 per share. The Company issued a $1,400,000 promissory note to Shama Zoe for the purchase of these shares. The promissory note beared interest at 12% and had a maturity date of March 14, 2003. The Company repaid this note plus accrued interest in full during February 2003.
During June 2003, the Company announced its plans to dispose of certain of its Wyoming properties in the Greater Green River Basin covering approximately 62,500 acres, net to its interest. The Company is also currently considering additional options for this area such as the farm-out of some of our acreage and other similar type transactions.
During 2003, the Company impaired certain of its unproved acreage in Wyoming by reclassifying $1,725,000 of costs associated with this acreage into the full cost pool. The impairment represents the cost of certain of the Company's acreage that the Company no longer considers prospective. These costs became subject to amortization during the fourth quarter of 2003.
Southern California Project
The Company has a leasehold interest in approximately 3,868 gross acres (2,641 net acres) in Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties of Southern California. The Company has no drilling or development plans for this acreage during 2004, but plans to continue paying leasehold rentals and other minimum geological expenses to preserve the Company's acreage positions on these prospects. The Company may consider selling these positions in the future.
Repurchase of Stock for Acreage
On July 16, 2002, Gasco executed and closed a purchase agreement with Brek Energy Corporation ("Brek"), and certain other Gasco stockholders (the "Other Stockholders"), pursuant to which Brek and the Other Stockholders purchased from Gasco an undivided 25% of Gasco's working interests in all undeveloped acreage owned by Gasco, representing 35,169 net undeveloped acres, in exchange for 6,250,000 shares of Gasco common stock and 500 shares of Gasco preferred stock held by Brek and the Other Stockholders. The Other Stockholders assigned their right to receive their share of such working interests to Brek, so that Brek acquired title to all of the working interests conveyed by Gasco in the transaction. Brek also had the option to acquire additional undeveloped acreage that it did not exercise.
The transaction was recorded at $16,709,000 based on the average trading price of the Company's common stock when the transaction was consummated The transaction was recorded as a reduction to the Company's unproved properties and a reduction to the Company's additional paid in capital, preferred and common stock.
Company Reserve Estimates
The following table summarizes the Company's estimated reserve data as of December 31, 2003, as estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent petroleum engineers. The present value of future net cash flows is
based on prices at December 31, 2003 of $5.89 per Mcf of gas and $29.69 per bbl of oil. All of the Company's reserves are located within the state of Utah.
Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of any estimate. A decrease in price of $0.10 per Mcf for natural gas and $1.00 per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in the Company's December 31, 2003 present value of future net cash flows of approximately $672,600.
On March 9, 2004 the Company completed the acquisition of additional working interests in six of the Company's producing wells, 13,062 net acres and gathering system assets located in the Uinta Basin in Utah for approximately $3,175,000. The acquisition consists of approximately 7,637,000 Mcf and 62,000 Bbls of proved gas and oil reserves with a present value discounted at 10% of approximately $8,064,000. Pursuant to an existing contract, an unrelated third party has the right to purchase 25% of the acquired properties at the acquisition price within 30 days following the date of the acquisition.
No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company held an interest in 14 gross (5.5 net) producing gas wells and 4 gross (4.0 net) shut-in gas wells located on these properties. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company drilled and cased one additional successful well and acquired additional working interests in six producing wells in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Following those events, the Company holds an interest in 16 gross (6.1 net) producing gas wells and 4 gross (4.0 net) shut-in gas wells on these properties, and currently operates 18 wells, of which 13 are producing.
The following table presents information regarding the Company's net costs incurred in the purchase of proved and unproved properties and in exploration and development activities:
(a) Includes seismic data acquisitions of $850,000 during the year ended December 31, 2002.
Productive Gas Wells
The following summarizes the Company's productive and shut-in gas wells as of December 31, 2003. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Shut-in wells are wells that are capable of production but are currently not producing. Gross wells are the total number of wells in which the Company has an interest. Net wells are the sum of the Company's fractional interests owned in the gross wells. Productive Gas Wells Gross Net
Producing gas wells 14 5.5 Shut-in gas wells 4 4.0 -- --- 18 9.5 == ===
The Company operates seven of the above producing wells and all of the shut-in wells. Five of the remaining seven producing wells in the above table were drilled by ConocoPhillips within Gasco's and ConocoPhillip's Area of Mutual Interest in the Riverbend Project and were operated by ConocoPhillips. Gasco took over operations of these wells effective January 1, 2004. The two remaining producing wells are located in Sublette County Wyoming and were drilled and are operated by Burlington.
On March 9, 2004 the Company completed the acquisition of additional working interests in six of the Company's producing wells, 13,062 net acres and gathering system assets located in the Uinta Basin in Utah for approximately $3,175,000. Pursuant to an existing contract, an unrelated third party has the right to purchase 25% of the acquired properties at the acquisition price within 30 days following the date of the acquisition. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2004, the Company drilled and cased a successful well in the Uinta Basin of Utah.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth the undeveloped and developed leasehold acreage, by area, held by the Company as of December 31, 2003. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Developed acres are acres, which are spaced or assignable to productive wells. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which Gasco has a working interest. Net acres are the sum of Gasco's fractional interests owned in the gross acres. The table does not include acreage that the Company has a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which the Company has not yet received leasehold assignments. In certain leases, the Company's ownership is not the same for all depths; therefore, the net acres in these leases are calculated using the greatest ownership interest at any depth. Generally this greater interest represents Gasco's ownership in the primary objective formation.

The following table summarizes the gross and net undeveloped acres by area that will expire in each of the next three years.
During 2003, the Company impaired certain of its unproved acreage in Wyoming by reclassifying $1,725,000 of costs associated with this acreage into the full cost pool. The impairment represents the cost of certain of the Company's acreage expiring in 2004 that the Company no longer considers prospective. These costs became subject to amortization during the fourth quarter of 2003. The impaired acreage (approximately 9,136 net acres) is excluded from the tables above.
During February 2002, the Company purchased at a BLM sale a 45% interest in 21,614 gross acres (9,726 net acres) for approximately $1,428,000. Effective July 16, 2002, the Company assigned 25% of this interest to Brek, resulting in the Company's net acres being reduced from 9,726 acres to 7,295 acres. After the sale, the Company was notified by the BLM in Wyoming that several environmental groups filed a protest against the BLM offering numerous parcels of land for oil and gas leasing. All of the parcels (leases) purchased by the Company were placed in suspense pending the resolution of this protest. The Company was notified in July 2003 that all of the protested leases were released from suspense. The value of these leases is recorded as unproved mineral interests in the accompanying financial statements.
As of December 31, 2003, approximately 79% of the acreage that Gasco holds is located on federal lands and approximately 19% of the acreage is located on state lands. It has been Gasco's experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands. The Company has generally been able to obtain state permits within 30 days, while obtaining federal permits has taken several months or longer. Accordingly, if the development of the Company's acreage located on federal lands is delayed significantly by the permitting process, the Company may have to operate at a loss for an extended period of time.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth the Company's drilling activity during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In the table, "gross" refers to the total wells in which we have a working interest, and "net" refers to gross wells multiplied by the Company's working interest.
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company drilled and cased a successful well and is currently in the process of drilling another well, both of which are located in the Unita Basin of Utah.
Office Space
The Company leases approximately 3,255 square feet of office space in Englewood, Colorado for approximately $46,000 per year under two leases, both of which terminate on August 30, 2004. The Company intends to renew these leases at current or lower rates when the current leases expire in August 2004.
