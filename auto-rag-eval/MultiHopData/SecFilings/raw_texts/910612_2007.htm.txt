Malls
We own a controlling interest in 75 Malls (including large open-air centers) and non-controlling interests in nine Malls. We also own a controlling interest in three Mall expansions and a noncontrolling interest in one Mall expansion that are currently under construction. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas.
The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores (20,000 square feet or less) lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls’ parking areas.
We classify our regional malls into two categories - malls that have completed their initial lease-up are referred to as stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease-up phase and have not been open for three calendar years are referred to as non-stabilized malls. The non-stabilized malls currently include Coastal Grand-Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, SC, which opened in March 2004; Imperial Valley Mall in El Centro, CA, which opened in March 2005; Southaven Towne Center in Southaven, MS, which opened in October 2005; Gulf Coast Town Center in Ft. Myers, FL, which opened in November 2005; and Alamance Crossing in Burlington, NC, which opened in August 2007.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Walnut Square, Westgate Mall, St. Clair Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, Wausau Center, Chapel Hill Mall, Eastgate Mall, Eastland Mall and Monroeville Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.

Anchors
Anchors are an important factor in a Mall’s successful performance. The public’s identification with a mall property typically focuses on the anchor tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.
Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to mall store tenants. Anchors account for 9.8% of the total revenues from our Properties. Each anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2007, we added the following anchors and junior anchor boxes (i.e., non-traditional anchors) to the following Malls:

Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 8,658 mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 85.3% of the occupied mall store GLA. Although mall stores occupy
only 28.7% of the total mall GLA (the remaining 71.3% is occupied by anchors), the Malls received 85.0% of their revenues from mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2007:
(1)
Total annualized contractual base rent in effect at December 31, 2007 for all leases that were in occupancy as of December 31, 2007, including rent for space that is leased but not occupied.
(2)
Total annualized contractual base rent of expiring leases as a percentage of the total annualized base rent of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2007.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by sales. The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last three years:
(1)
Consistent with industry practice, sales are based on reports by retailers (excluding theaters) leasing mall store GLA of 10,000 square feet or less. Represents 100% of sales for the Malls. In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls.
(2)
Represents reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges and certain capital expenditures.
Associated Centers
We own a controlling interest in 28 Associated Centers and a non-controlling interest in four Associated Centers. We also own a controlling interest in two Associated Centers that were under construction at December 31, 2007.
Associated Centers are retail properties that are adjacent to a regional mall complex and include one or more anchors, or big box retailers, along with smaller tenants. Anchor tenants typically include tenants such as TJ Maxx, Target and Goody’s. Associated Centers are managed by the staff at the Mall since it is adjacent to and usually benefits from the customers drawn to the Mall.
We own the land underlying the Associated Centers in fee simple interest, except for Bonita Lakes Crossing, which is subject to a long-term ground lease.
The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Associated Centers as of December 31, 2007:

Community Centers
We own a controlling interest in 13 Community Centers and a non-controlling interest in two Community Centers. We own a controlling interest in three Community Centers that are currently under construction.
Community Centers typically have less development risk because of shorter development periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain higher occupancy levels and are more stable, they typically have slower rent growth because the anchor stores’ rents are typically fixed and are for longer terms.
Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.
We own the land underlying the Community Centers in fee simple interest, except for Massard Crossing and Brassfield Shopping Center, which are subject to long-term ground leases for all of the land underlying the properties.
