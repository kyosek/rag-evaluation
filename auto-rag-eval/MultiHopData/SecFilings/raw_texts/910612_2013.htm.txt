ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 75 Malls and non-controlling interests in 9 Malls as of December 31, 2013. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta, which opened in July 2013, and The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City, which opened in August 2011, were classified as non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2013. The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City was our only non-stabilized Mall as of December 31, 2012.
(3)
Non-core Malls - Malls where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, which may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, we have determined that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. Similar criteria apply to the classification of an Associated Center or Community Center as a non-core Property. Columbia Place, Citadel Mall, Chapel Hill Mall and Madison Square were classified as non-core Malls as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, Madison Plaza, an Associated Center adjacent to Madison Square, was classified as a non-core Property as of December 31, 2013. Columbia Place was our only non-core Mall as of December 31, 2012. The steps taken to reposition non-core Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of non-core Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude non-core Properties.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Walnut Square, WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Brookfield Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, Wausau Center, Chapel Hill Mall and Eastgate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.
The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 2013:
* Non-stabilized Mall

In addition to base rent, the landlord receives 20% of the percentage rents collected. The Company has a right of first refusal to purchase the fee.

Anchors
Anchors are an important factor in a Mall’s successful performance. The public’s identification with a mall property typically focuses on the anchor tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.
Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to mall store tenants. Total rental revenues from anchors account for 12.6% of the total revenues from our Properties in 2013. Each anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2013, we added the following anchors and junior anchors to the following Malls:
As of December 31, 2013, the Malls had a total of 330 anchors. The mall anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2013 is as follows:
As of December 31, 2013, the Malls had a total of 122 junior anchors including three vacant locations. The mall junior anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2013 is as follows:
Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 7,752 mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 66.9% of the occupied mall store GLA. Although mall stores occupy only 31.0% of the total mall GLA (the remaining 69.0% is occupied by anchors or is vacant), the Malls received 81.7% of their revenues from mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2013:
(1)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable common area expenses and real estate taxes, in effect at December 31, 2013 for expiring leases that were executed as of December 31, 2013.
(2)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable common area expenses and real estate taxes, of expiring leases as a percentage of the total annualized gross rent of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2013.
(3)
Total GLA of expiring leases as a percentage of the total GLA of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2013.
See page 57 for a comparison between rents on leases that expired in the current reporting period compared to rents on new and renewal leases executed in 2013. Our goal is to continue to convert shorter term leases to longer terms. For leases expiring in 2014 that we are able to renew or replace with new tenants, we anticipate that we will be able to achieve higher rental rates than the existing rates of the expiring leases as retailers seek out space in our market-dominant Properties and new supply remains constricted. Page 57 also includes new and renewal leasing activity as of December 31, 2013 with commencement dates in 2013 and 2014.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by sales. Mall store sales represents total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet. The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for the three years ended December 31, 2013:
(1)
In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls. The information in this table is based on 100% of the applicable amounts and has not been adjusted for our ownership share.
(2)
Represents reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, marketing and certain capital expenditures.

Associated Centers
We owned a controlling interest in 25 Associated Centers and a non-controlling interest in 4 Associated Centers as of December 31, 2013.

Community Centers
We owned a controlling interest in seven Community Centers and a non-controlling interest in four Community Centers as of December 31, 2013. Community Centers typically have less development risk because of shorter development periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain higher occupancy levels and are more stable, they typically have slower rent growth because the anchor stores’ rents are typically fixed and are for longer terms.
Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.
