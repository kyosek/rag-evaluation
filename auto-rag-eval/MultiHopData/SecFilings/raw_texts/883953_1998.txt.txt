ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
Exploration and Development Projects and Acquisitions
In 1998, HCRC incurred $37,565,000 in direct property additions, development, exploitation and exploration costs. The costs were comprised of $28,182,000 for property acquisitions and approximately $9,383,000 for domestic exploration and development. The expenditures resulted in the drilling, recompletion, or workover of 41 development wells and 34 exploration wells. HCRC completed 37 development wells (90%) and 18 exploration wells (53%) for an overall completion rate of 73%. HCRC's 1998 capital program led to the replacement, including revisions to prior year reserves, of 120% of 1998 production using year-end prices of $10.00 per bbl and $1.85 per mcf. Using five year average price of $16.64 per bbl and $1.78 per mcf, HCRC's reserve replacement for 1998 would have been 200% of 1998 production. Management utilizes average price reserves internally because it believes these prices more accurately reflect the value to be achieved over time. Excluded from these calculations are sales of reserves in place in 1998, which were approximately 3% of 1998 production. In 1998, HCRC expended approximately $1,672,000 for land and seismic costs, which HCRC anticipates will yield prospects for 1999 and subsequent years.
Property Sales
During 1998, HCRC received approximately $107,000 for the sale of 67 nonstrategic properties located in eight states.

Greater Permian Region
HCRC has significant interests in the Greater Permian Region, which includes West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. In this region, HCRC has interests in 537 productive oil and gas wells (423 of which are operated), 38 operated shut-in oil and gas wells and 17 (15 operated) salt water disposal wells or injection wells. In 1998, HCRC expended approximately $11,685,000 (31%) of its capital budget on projects in this area. HCRC spent approximately $2,200,000 for drilling, recompletion, or workover of 23 development wells and for drilling 18 exploration wells. Seventy-eight percent of the wells drilled or recompleted are producing. The following is a description of the significant areas and 1998 capital projects within the Greater Permian Region.
Arcadia Acquisition. In October 1998, HCRC purchased for $8,200,000 oil and gas properties, including interests in approximately 570 wells located primarily in Texas, numerous proven and unproven drilling locations, exploration acreage, and 3-D seismic data. HPI operates approximately 85% of the proven property value. The acquisition added estimated proven reserves of approximately 576,000 barrels of oil and 5.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas at five-year average prices, and approximately 473,000 barrels of oil and 5.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas at year-end pricing. HCRC's estimated proven reserve addition of 9.0 bcfe represents approximately 61% of HCRC's 1998 production at five-year average prices, and 56% of HCRC's 1998 production at year-end prices. HCRC estimates that gross 1999 production from the properties could be approximately 1.1 bcfe. In 1999, HCRC plans to divest approximately 400 of the wells acquired from Arcadia. The wells to be sold are nonstrategic, nonoperated, and represent only 6% of the acquisition's production and 4% of its average price value. During 1999 HCRC plans to study areas for future development project implementation.
Carlsbad/Catclaw Area. HCRC's interests in the Carlsbad/Catclaw Area as of December 31, 1998 consisted of 93 producing wells that produce primarily natural gas and are located on the northwestern edge of the Delaware Basin in Lea, Eddy and Chaves Counties, New Mexico. HPI operates 37 of these wells. The wells produce at depths ranging from approximately 2,500 feet to 14,000 feet from the Delaware, Atoka, Bone Springs and Morrow formations. In 1998, HCRC spent approximately $488,000 recompleting or drilling eight producing development wells and drilling one unsuccessful exploration well. HCRC expects to continue operated development drilling in the Hat Mesa Field.
East Keystone Area. HCRC's interest in the East Keystone Area as of December 31, 1998 consisted of 55 producing wells, 37 of which are operated by HPI, in Winkler County, Texas. The primary focus of this area is the development of the Holt and San Andreas formations at a depth of 5,100 feet. During 1998, HCRC had eight development projects, of which seven were successful. HCRC's future development plans include a total of three projects for this area.
Merkle Area. HCRC's interest in the Merkle Area as of December 31, 1998 consists of 29 producing wells, 16 of which are operated by HPI in Taylor and Nolan Counties, Texas. HCRC's nonoperated interest in the Merkle Area includes 10 square miles of proprietary seismic data in Jones, Nolan and Taylor Counties, Texas, which was acquired in 1995. Based on its initial success in the nonoperated Merkle Area, HCRC acquired 74 additional miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data adjacent to the nonoperated area. HCRC's focus in this area is exploration of the Canyon, Strawn, Flippen, Tannehill and Ellenberger formations at depths of 2,500 to 6,500 feet. In 1998, HCRC drilled 11 exploration wells and one development well, nine of which were completed. HCRC incurred approximately $1,054,000 in costs in 1998 for the 12 wells drilled. HCRC owns an average 28.5% working interest in the wells. Even with current low crude oil prices, continued drilling in this area is economic, and HCRC anticipates additional 1999 drilling to continue to exploit the reef structures.
Griffin Project. In 1998, HCRC purchased land for $105,000 and incurred costs of approximately $452,000 to drill three exploration wells and one development well in Gaines County, Texas. None of the four nonoperated 7,500 foot Leonardian sand wells was successful. Due to limited delineation drilling potential in this area and low oil prices, HCRC will delay future drilling and evaluate the viability of the remaining exploration projects. HCRC owns an average 25% working interest in the prospect area.
Spraberry Area. HCRC's interests in the Spraberry Area consist of 360 producing wells, 13 salt water disposal wells and 36 shut-in wells in Dawson, Upton, Reagan and Irion Counties, Texas. HPI operates 380 of these wells. Most of the current production from the wells is from the Upper and Lower Spraberry, Clearfork Canyon, Dean and Fusselman formations at depths ranging from 5,000 feet to 9,000 feet. During 1998, HCRC drilled or recompleted three wells, all of which are producing. As a result of low crude oil prices, HCRC abandoned twenty-three wells in this area in 1998. During 1999, HCRC plans to shut-in 29 uneconomic wells and has scheduled 25 additional wells for abandonment. The wells scheduled for shut-in produce, in total, only 40 mcfe per day, net to HCRC, and were operating at a net loss to HCRC of $65,000 per year. Future plans for this area include eight development wells and workovers and additional projects contingent upon future evaluation. The price of crude oil must increase before these projects can be considered viable.
Gulf Coast Region
HCRC has significant interests in the Gulf Coast Region in Louisiana and South and East Texas. HCRC's most significant interest in the Gulf Coast Region consists of 23 producing gas wells and six salt water disposal wells located in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. The wells produce principally from the Bol Mex formations at 13,500 to 14,500 feet and 11 are operated by HPI. The two most significant wells in the area are the A.L. Boudreaux #1 and the G.S. Boudreaux Estate #1. In South and East Texas, HCRC has interests in 203 wells, 65 of which are operated by HPI and produce primarily from the Austin Chalk, Paluxy, Lower Frio and Cotton Valley formations at depths from 7,000 to 13,000 feet. During 1998, HCRC expended approximately $4,240,000 (11%) of its capital budget in this region in Louisiana and South and East Texas. The following discussion relates to major 1998 capital projects within the region.
Bell Project. HCRC has a 30% working interest in an operated project to evaluate the Buda, Carrizo, Woodbine, and Dexter sands in Houston County, Texas. HCRC's drilling costs in 1998 for a 9,200-foot horizontal well were approximately $615,000. The well encountered Buda pay and sales of production began in December 1998, after gas processing equipment was installed. The well primarily produces oil. HCRC achieved gross sustained production rates of 8.2 mmcfe per day; however, due to current low oil prices, flowing rates have been reduced to approximately 4 mmcfe per day. HCRC also incurred $375,000 in 1998 for land and leasehold costs relating to the project. HCRC plans additional delineation drilling in 1999. HCRC anticipates that single or multi-lateral horizontal drilling will be the principal drilling practice used in this area. The gross targeted potential for the project could be 2.4 bcfe per well. There can be no assurance, however, that any well drilled will be successful.
Bison Prospect. HCRC participated in a nonoperated 18,000 foot exploratory well in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana targeting a large Klump sands structure. Drilling problems prevented the well from reaching total depth and testing the primary target horizon in the prospect; however, the secondary target horizon was tested and found to be non-productive. The well was plugged and abandoned. Total land and drilling costs incurred by HCRC during 1998 for its 2.5% working interest were approximately $217,000. Blue Moon Project. During 1998, HCRC entered into a farmout arrangement under which it contributed acreage to a project drilled in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. A well was recently completed and tested over 14 mmcfe of gas per day. HCRC's after payout working interest in the well depends on unit boundary determinations, but HEP anticipates that its working interest will be between 5% and 7%. HCRC paid no capital costs for its interest in the well, and payout is expected to occur during the second quarter of 1999.
East Smith Point. In 1998, HCRC participated in a Frio sand recompletion and a 3-D seismic review of the deep Vicksburg in Chambers County, Texas. HCRC owns a 49% working interest in the project and spent approximately $305,000 for drilling costs and approximately $426,000 for land and geologic and geophysical data. In 1998, the first 14,000-foot recompletion was unsuccessful. HCRC does not plan additional activity in this area.
Esperanza Project. HCRC owns a 7.9% working interest in a nonoperated 15,400-foot directional exploration discovery in the Wilcox formation in LaVaca County, Texas. The natural gas prospect was developed using proprietary 3-D seismic data, and the prospect could have a gross target of 60 bcf. The initial well has been completed and showed gross production rates of 10 mmcfd at a flowing tubing pressure of 9,000 psi. HCRC spent approximately $365,000 in 1998 for its share of costs. HCRC plans to participate in additional wells in 1999 to further exploit this discovery. There can be no assurance, however, that any well drilled will be successful.
Intercoastal Prospect. In 1998, HPI took over operation of a well in which it did not own an interest in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. The Planulina sands were faulted out in the original wellbore, and HCRC sidetracked the well at a depth of 14,467 feet to test the sands. The well was drilled and logged, and the objective sands, although well-developed, were found to contain water. The well was plugged and abandoned. HCRC spent $263,000 to test the concept.
Mirasoles Project. In 1998, HCRC spent approximately $430,000 for land costs related to the Mirasoles project in Kenedy County, Texas. HCRC owns an interest in 63 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data which defines a large structural prospect that could have a gross potential of 395 bcfe. HCRC spent approximately $941,000 in 1998 for its 17.5% working interest share of the cost of drilling a 17,000-foot Frio formation exploration well. The exploratory well is being completed, and depending upon test results, additional delineation and development drilling could be required to properly exploit the structure. There can be no assurance, however, that any well drilled will be successful.
Rocky Mountain Region
HCRC has significant interests in the Rocky Mountain Region, which include producing properties in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and Northwest New Mexico. HCRC has interests in 207 producing oil and gas wells, 168 of which are operated by HPI, 27 shut-in wells, 25 of which are operated by HPI, and five salt water disposal wells. HCRC expended approximately $20,669,000 (55%) of its 1998 capital budget in this area. Approximately $17,291,000 of the capital budget was used for the purchase of the volumetric production payment discussed below. In 1998, HCRC spent approximately $2,215,000 to recomplete or drill 13 development wells and to drill three exploration wells. Thirteen of the wells were completed. A discussion of the major projects in the region follows.
Cajon Lake Field. In 1998, HCRC sidetracked a 6,000-foot Ismay formation exploration well in San Juan County, Utah. HCRC developed the prospect from proprietary 3-D seismic data and HPI is the operator of the project. HCRC owns an approximate 15% working interest in the project and spent approximately $120,000 to complete the exploration well in 1998. Sales of crude oil production began in November; however, production will be significantly curtailed until a natural gas pipeline is constructed to eliminate flaring. HCRC projects that the fully developed prospect could have 6 bcfe gross potential. There can no assurance, however, that any well drilled will be successful. Despite low oil prices, additional delineation drilling is anticipated in 1999.
Colorado Western Slope Project. HCRC drilled and completed two 5,500 foot Dakota formation wells in the Piceance Basin in Western Colorado. HCRC owns an average 51% working interest in the wells. The wells had a combined initial production rate of 1.5 mmcf per day, and both wells began sales of production in the third quarter of 1998. In 1998, HCRC also recompleted an additional well. Total costs in 1998 for the three wells were approximately $565,000. HCRC has identified fourteen additional development locations. HCRC projects that the total project area could have gross potential reserves of 0.8 bcfe, which is the typical reserve potential for this area. There can no assurance, however, that any well drilled will be successful.
Toole County Area. HCRC's interests in the Toole County Area consist of 61 producing wells and 17 shut-in wells, 66 of which are operated by HPI. The oil wells produce from the Nisku formation at depths of approximately 3,000 feet, and the gas wells produce from the Bow Island formation at depths of 900 to 1,200 feet. In 1998, HCRC drilled three horizontal wells in the East Kevin Field to the Nisku formation. Two of the oil wells were completed and had combined initial production rates of 1.3 mmcfe per day. HCRC has a 50% working interest in the project and spent approximately $728,000 in 1998. Because of current low oil prices in this sour, lower gravity crude area, HCRC has halted the drilling of additional development wells and has postponed the re-entry and sidetrack of the remaining well drilled in 1998.
San Juan Basin Project - Colorado. In July 1996, HCRC and its affiliate Hallwood Energy Partners, L.P. ("HEP") acquired interests in 34 wells in LaPlata County, Colorado producing from the Fruitland Coal formation at approximately 3,000 feet. An unaffiliated large East Coast financial institution formed an entity to utilize tax credits generated from the wells. All production from the wells generates an additional payment of approximately $.68 per mcf. An affiliate of Enron Corp. financed the project through a volumetric production payment ("VPP"). During May 1998, a limited liability company owned equally by HCRC and HEP, purchased the VPP from the affiliate of Enron Corp. HCRC funded its $17,291,000 share of the acquisition price from operating cash flow and borrowings under its Credit Agreement. As a result of the acquisition, HCRC replaced the higher cost and administratively burdensome VPP financing with lower cost conventional borrowings under its line of credit. At the time of the purchase, HCRC entered into a financial contract to hedge the volumes subject to the production payment at an average price of $2.11 per mmbtu. Under the terms of the original 1996 transaction, HCRC and HEP were already responsible for costs associated with the wells. HPI has managed and operated the wells since July 1996, and has increased the wells' gross production from 14 mmcf to approximately 23.5 mmcf per day through workovers and gas gathering facilities improvement programs. The acquisition increased HCRC's current average daily production by 6.25 mmcf per day.
San Juan Basin Project - New Mexico. HCRC's interest in the San Juan Basin consists of 51 producing gas wells and 10 shut-in wells located in San Juan County, New Mexico. HPI operates all 51 producing wells in New Mexico, 31 of which produce from the Fruitland Coal formation at approximately 2,200 feet and 20 of which produce from the Pictured Cliffs, Mesa Verde and Dakota formations at 1,200 to 7,000 feet. The expansion of the gathering system significantly increased gas gathering, processing and compression capacity for the associated properties, which resulted in gross production increases of 3.0 mmcf per day in 1998. In addition to proceeds from the sale of gas, HCRC also receives a payment of $.36 per mcf for tax credits generated by production from the coalbed methane wells.
Other
HCRC owns various other interests in properties in Kansas, Oklahoma, California and South Central Texas. The remaining $971,000 of HCRC's 1998 capital expenditures were incurred in this area. The costs include $325,000 for an unsuccessful exploration project in Carter County, Oklahoma, $157,000 for the completion of an exploration well in Canadian County, Oklahoma and for drilling four unsuccessful exploration wells in Yolo County, California and other miscellaneous projects. During 1998, HCRC also participated in two nonoperated 3-D seismic projects in nearby Solano and Colusa Counties, California. HCRC is in the process of divesting its interests in California projects. As a result of low oil prices and high lifting costs, HCRC plan to shut-in 35 uneconomic wells and to outsource its field workforce in 1999. These cost reduction measures are projected to save $230,000 per year in net operating expenses.
Peru Block Z-3 Project. HCRC's partner on the Peruvian offshore Z-3 Block completed 1,200 miles of 2-D seismic data acquisition to supplement existing seismic data. Data interpretation is in progress, and it will be reviewed by HCRC in the first quarter of 1999. HCRC has a 7.5% working interest in the project, but it will not incur capital costs until actual drilling operations begin. Although the production-sharing contract provides that drilling operations must begin no later than January 2002, it is anticipated that the Peruvian government will enact legislation to extend the period for all drilling commitments by one year.
For 1999, HCRC's capital budget, which will be paid from cash generated from operations and cash on hand, has been set at $5,152,000. HCRC has budgeted continued low oil prices for 1999 which significantly impacts cash generated from operations. Consequently, the capital budget has been set at a lower amount than the budget for past years. The capital budget for 1999 will be reduced if HCRC is required to make a principal payment on its debt and if oil and gas prices decrease further.
