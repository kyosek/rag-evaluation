Item 2. Description of Property
Burns Mountain Mineral Claims (Burns Group)
The Burns Group mineral claims are held 100% by Gemco and are being explored for lode gold occurrences of a type similar to those known to occur within the historical Cariboo Gold (Wells - Barkerville) mining camp. Our Burns Group project consists of 10 contiguous mineral claims totaling 12,696 acres (5,134 hectares). The property lies in the Cariboo Mining District, approximately 10 kilometers west of the past producing Cariboo Gold Quartz, Island Mountain and Mosquito Creek gold mines located at the town of Wells, British Columbia.
The Burns Group property is underlain by meta-sedimentary rocks of the Barkerville Terrain and contains known auriferous, fault related, quartz vein structures. The property covers the eastern edge of a “linear” belt which coincides with the limits of the Lightening Creek placer camp. Due to the significant amount of placer gold production from the Stanley/Lightening Creek area, the Burns Group property is considered a key target for tracing the source of the placer gold of the region. Limited historical lode gold production has been reported at workings located on the property. Gemco Minerals Inc. is currently engaged in grassroots exploration activities to better define and locate possible extensions of the known mineralized areas while searching for new discoveries.
Gemco’s exploration approach has been to employ qualified personnel who are familiar with the history and geology of the area to assess the merits of the historical workings as well as conceive new targets for exploration. The company’s GIS staff are currently building a database of historical data and combining it with current exploration findings. Geological, geophysical and geochemical technical works have, to date, defined two areas which warrant a more intensive exploration program. The two areas of current primary interest are the Foster’s East soil grid gold anomalies and the sulphide rich quartz vein structures of the Perkins Gulch area.
There are no parks located on the claims which would interfere with the exploration for or the exploitation of any mineral deposits that might be found here; however, a narrow conditional reserve is located along the old Cariboo Waggon Road gold rush trail from Stanley to Barkerville: the historic trail surface is protected from being “interfered with” along a 200 meter wide zone of the road, or 100 meters on each side of the road from the centerline. A no staking reserve is also located to the northwest of the Burns Group property along Highway 26: the reserve is about 500 meters by 500 meters in size. Gemco Minerals Inc. is not currently aware of any environmental liabilities pertaining to the Mount Burns Claim Group and there are no disputes as to title or liens registered on the property.
As at December 15, 2007 Gemco received its most recent NI43-101 compliant technical report from geologist, Robert Reid, P.Geo and Angelique Justason. In 2000, Mr. Reid was responsible for the Bonanza Ledge gold discovery, a major gold find for International Wayside Ltd., one of the biggest players in the area; and, Ms. Justason was instrumental in defining the perimeter of the deposit using self-potential geophysics in 2000 as well as outlining several other anomalous target areas on the property the following year. Gemco is committed to conduct extensive exploration on the Burns property as the NI43-101 report has identified specific target areas.
The Company and its directors will disclose information as required under the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) with respect to the technical report prepared and submitted to the Company by its geologist, Robert E. (Ned) Reid, P.Geo, and Angelique Justason. Mr. Reid is a registered Professional Geoscientist in good standing in the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia. He is a graduate of the University of British Columbia (1971) and has practiced his profession as an exploration geologist for more than 35 years.
Location and Access
The Burns Group project is located in the Quesnel Highland area of the Interior Plateau in the Province of British Columbia, as depicted in Figure 1 below. The property is situated within NTS area 93H/04, TRIM areas 93H002 and 93H003; centered approximately at 53° 03’ North latitude and 121° 38’ East longitude. The claims are in the Cariboo Mining District.
Figure 1: Burns Group Mineral Property Location Map (drafted by A.Justason Nov.2007)
Access to the northern portion of the property is via Highway 26 (Wells/Barkerville Highway) which transects the northwestern portion of the claims a distance of 10 Km west from the Town of Wells or 70 Km east of Quesnel. Additional access is via the deactivated ‘72F’ forest service road which heads south from the Stanley loop road, and joins into the historic Cariboo Waggon Trail. Though limited, several deactivated forest service roads and numerous ATV accessible trails provide additional access.
The original tenure area has been converted to “cell” units under the rules and regulations of the Mineral Title Act, hence physical boundaries no longer exist. With conversion to “cell” units the value of exploration and development required to maintain a mineral claim for one year is at least $4 per hectare during the first, second and third anniversary years and $8 per hectare for each subsequent anniversary year.
Exploration History (from Gemco’s 2007 NI43-101 Technical Report, with internal history update for 2008/09)
The following is a general summary of the historical work conducted at Mount Burns and Oregon Gulch (in the vicinity of the Foster’s East grid) as reported by Gemco’s most recent NI43-101 Technical Report and company personnel.
Mount Burns:
The Mount Burns area includes historical workings including numerous shafts, adits and tunnels such as the Burns Long Crosscut, the Standard Mine, the Cohen and the Perkins. Numerous opencuts and trenching occur near or at these workings and reverted crown granted lands occur across the property.
• 1870’s discovery of auriferous quartz veins
• 1878, J.C. Beedy selectively mines veins from surface and processed some ore using a quartz mill at Van Winkle. The veins, oriented 195°-205°/70°W, contained gold in association with pyrite and galena across of about one foot.
• 1880, J. Reid acquired the property after the death of J.C. Beedy; the Reid Adit was driven as a crosscut to intersect the Beedy veins 75 feet below the surface showings. The adit was collared at an elevation of 5062 feet and driven on an azimuth of 108° for a distance of 387 feet. A quartz vein (probably the central vein) about one foot in width, striking 205° and dipping 62°NW was drifted to the north for 20 feet at a distance of 337 feet from the portal. A raise was driven to surface and, probably, some [stoping] was carried out on the vein.
• The Cohen veins, 1500 feet northeast of the Perkins veins were mined prior to 1885. Workings, between elevations of 5250 and 5300 feet, consist of several open cuts with associated shafts and mine dumps. C. Fuller indicated that the shaft on the Cohen Incline was 70-90 feet deep. The open cuts were driven into the hillside along strike of veins less than one foot in width and with orientations 065°/75°SE, 205°/65°W and 190° dipping steeply to the west. The veins contain high grade gold mineralization in association with galena, pyrite and sphalerite.
• Work on the Galena vein, located at an elevation of 5190 feet and about 700 feet northeast of the Perkins veins, was probably also carried out at about his time. The original workings consisted of a mine dump, an open cut driven northwest for eighty feet and a shallow drift of a vein oriented 230°/55°NW for eighty feet.
• 1885, E. Perkins selectively mined the Beedy veins and processed ore using an arrastre for a number of years.
• 1902, C.J. Seymour Baker and A.J.R. Atkins recovered about ten ounces of gold from ten tons of ore treated at the Government Reduction Works near Barkerville.
• 1919, C.J. Fuller and D. Hawes acquired the property after the death of E. Perkins.
• 1932, Burns Mountain Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd acquired the property and extended the Reid Adit fifty feet and drove the Burns Mountain Adit as a crosscut to intersect the Perkins veins 275 feet below the surface showings. This adit was collared at an elevation of 4844 feet and driven 1743 feet on an azimuth of 327° and 420 feet on an azimuth of 284°. A vein striking 197° and dipping 70°W was intersected 150 feet west of the Perkins showing and on to the north for 127 feet.
• R.E. MacDougall, W.E. North [and] J.J. Gunn [of Wells relocated the ground after the Burns Mountain Quartz Mining Company Ltd. allowed the property to lapse].
• 1946, Cariboo Rainbow Gold Quartz Mines Ltd completed 3500 feet of stripping and trenching using a bulldozer. The stripping showed that the Perkins area consisted of three narrow veins about fifty feet apart over a composite strike of about 400 feet. Shafts are associated with the west and central veins. The northern 150 feet of the central vein is marked by [stopes] caved to surface and was probably the source of most ore mined from the property.
• 1979, L&G Resources Ltd contracted C. Ball to conduct one day of field work on the property (Ball, 1979).
• 1980, Spectrum Industrial Resources Limited: trenched, sampled and mapped the Cohen, Galena and Perkins showings at a scale of 1:200; produced a geological map at a scale of 1:5000; completed about 315 meters of diamond drilling in three holes, one on each showing. Drill hole S80-1 intersected a zone of vein quartz and fracturing (core length of seven meters), thought to be the Perkins structure about twenty meters above the Burns Mountain Adit, but got no gold values.
• About 1990, M. Poshner excavated the main showings. The Perkins area is a trench twenty feet deep and six hundred feet in length. The galena vein is a trench about three hundred feet in length. The Cohen veins are in a stripped area about 600x150 feet in size.
• In 1990, Tom Hatton( Gemco’s President) discovered an 8.5 ounce gold nugget at Burns Creek which was recorded and published in the B.C. mining records.
• Firstline Recovery Systems Inc. purchased ‘Burns 1’ mineral claim from Doug Merrick of Wells, B.C. in 1998 and staked more property in 1999. Firstline carried out some surface prospecting, completed an orientation - type soil geochemistry survey of about 150 samples covering the area between the Perkins, Cohen and Galena showings and ran several magnetometer and VLF geophysical survey lines across the Perkins and Galena showings. Vein structures show a distinct VLF signature.
• In 2002, 7.74 line kilometers of existing grid was surveyed by Angelique Justason to search for self potential geophysical signatures in the vicinity of the historical Cohen, Beedy and Galena showings. The resulting data was analyzed and presented to the previous owner in the form of a preliminary map and personal communications.
• In 2005, Gemco Minerals Inc. acquired the Mount Burns Claim Group
• In 2006, a small 0.95 line kilometer self potential survey occurred near Dry-up Gulch.
• 2007 saw a 4.3 line kilometer expansion of the 2002 Burns grid located at the Perkins/Beedy and Galena showing
• In 2007, Gemco obtained mineral rights to the Standard Mine site when a legacy claim at L62-64 expired
• In 2008, an expansion of the Burns grid was prepared and a SP geophysical survey was conducted
• In spring 2009, over 50 line kilometers of trail was surveyed for conductive anomalies using GDD Instrumentation’s ‘Beep Mat’, a small electromagnetic geophysical tool.
Oregon Gulch:
The Jones and Foster ledges in Oregon Gulch consist of upper, lower and eastern adits, the Foster shaft as well as several open cuts.
• 1870’s, discovery of veins with gold
• 1877, trenches on veins between elevations of 4560 and 4570 feet; Foster shaft collared at about 4585 feet [and located] above the west branch of Oregon Gulch, driven 352° for 217 feet and followed by an additional 80 feet of crosscutting and drifting; several veins oriented 190°/70°W and less than a foot in width were found containing pyrite, galena and sphalerite. The veins are parallel in strike to a prominent fault dipping moderately east in underground workings.
• 1933, Foster Ledge Gold Mines Ltd drove the lower and eastern adits; lower adit driven 065° for 75 feet and 123° for 170 feet; at 32 feet back of the face a vein was drifted on for 43 feet to the northeast; the vein is less than 0.5 feet in width, oriented 025/80NE, and barren looking but contained some gold. Eastern adit driven 343° for 168 feet and 324° for 83 feet; at 23 feet back of the face a crosscut was driven on 058° for 60 feet and then 290° for 50 feet; veins less than 0.5 feet in width and oriented 202°/70°W and [218°/62°NW] were found at a distance of 70 feet and 118 feet respectively, from the portal; a fault several feet in width striking 165°-170° and dipping 60°-70°W was located at a face.
• In 1983 a ground magnetometer survey was conducted by D. Plenderleith for Gold Point Resources Ltd. (Davies, 2006).
• 1987 saw 63.0 line kilometers of cut line put in on an older property adjacent to and covering Gemco Minerals Inc. current tenure 506325. Approximately 5 line kilometers of that grid covers current tenure and it appears that the 1987 0+00 baseline is the baseline of Gemco’s current ‘Foster’s East’ grid. The 63.0 line kilometer grid saw soil sampling, VLF-EM and ground magnetometer surveys completed: details are reported in Borovic’s 1988 assessment report #18011.
• Firstline Recovery Systems Inc. acquires mineral tenures and begins work in 1998.
• 1999 involved field reconnaissance and prospecting over the Oregon Gulch area. Soil samples mark mineralized structures. More claims staked.
• 2004 saw a busy field season with a 13.07 km ‘Foster’s East’ grid established and a total of 766 soil samples (Reid, 2005) taken and submitted for multi-element ICP and fire assay for gold and silver. The assays from EcoTech Laboratory Ltd. returned anomalous gold-in-soils values which outlined several linear gold-in-soils anomalies as discussed in Firstline Recovery Systems Inc. 2004 assessment report #27684.
• Firstline Recovery Systems converted of all their mineral tenures into cells in the spring of 2005 (pers. comm., Hatton, 2006).
• Gemco Minerals Inc. acquired Mount Burns claim group from Firstline Recovery Systems Inc. in the summer of 2005.
• In 2006, a self potential geophysical survey of 1.1 line kilometers of the Foster’s East grid showed correlation with 2004 exploration program and provided further targets for the company
• Spring 2009 saw a small Beep Mat geophysical survey conducted on foot/snowshoe between the east edge of the Foster’s East grid and Highway 26.
Physiography and Geology (from Gemco’s 2007 NI43-101 Technical Report)
The project area lies in the forested mountain region located southwest of the Jack of Clubs Lake and is situated within the Quesnel Highlands on the eastern margin of the Interior Plateau. Elevations range from 1200 meters in the Stanley - Lightening Creek area to approximately 1680 meters at the mountain tops. Mountain summits are generally rounded, having been glaciated by continental ice sheets during the Pleistocene Epoch. Glacial till is the most widespread surficial deposit in the area. Areas of rock exposure are generally limited to fault related bluffs and, to some extent, mountain summits and road cuts. Drainage of the area is mostly within mossy draws which in several places lead into gold bearing placer creeks: these placer bearing creeks have been extensively worked and hydrauliced in the past. Less destructive means of placer exploration operations continue today. The area is in a moist climatic belt, subject to heavy snowfall in winter and generally rainy conditions in summer. The District of Wells can see winter accumulations of snow from about eight to over twenty feet. The area is usually snow free from late May to early November, providing Gemco Minerals Ltd. a four or five month window for an exploration season where the ground can be readily accessed. The Wells area is generally well forested; hillside slopes are dominated by spruce, pine, sub-alpine fir, accompanied by alders and other deciduous foliage on lower, wetter slopes flanking river valleys. At the Mount Burns Claim Group alone, it is estimated...that greater than 75% of the pine trees are presently dead standing due to the destructive nature of the pine beetle on the trees of the area over the past 6 years. Prior to 2002, no pine beetle kill was observed in the immediate area (pers.comm. A. Justason, 2006).
The petrology at the Mount Burns Claim Group is somewhat defined though detailed structural understanding of the property is not yet completely clear. The majority of the property is covered in glacial drift which limits outcrop exposures to the prominent north-south trending bluffs, the tops of ridges and divides, the steep slopes of hydrauliced creeks, road cuts and already worked, stripped and/or trenched ground. Some areas of glacial drift are defined in historic placer records as being up to 120 feet thick in places and sporadic with no consistent depth which could be in direct relationship with the ancient kettle topography of the last glacial retreat.
The rocks found at the property generally consist of foliated, gritty to fine grained quartzites ± sericite and finely laminated siltstone and phyllite ± sericite. Alteration of the country rock is spotty and generally chloritic. Silicification of the country rock is apparent in areas usually adjacent to fault structures. Carbonaceous to calcareous siltstones have also been observed. Holland’s description of the local area’s geology is believed to be the most prolific; and, taken partially out of context, is quoted as follows:
“The Stanley area is underlain by a succession of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks belonging to the Precambrian Richfield formation...The area straddles the regional anticlinal axis which has been mapped previously (Johnston and Uglow, 1926 p. 31) as running between Mount Amador and Mount Nelson”. [NOTE:Struik has moved the anticlinal axis slightly to the southwest and has differentiated the main units as the Eaglesnest succession and Harveys Ridge succession within the Paleozoic Snowshoe Group of the Barkerville Terrane].
“Quartzite, in almost bewildering variety, is the predominating rock in the area. It displays variations in colour from white and light grey, through medium grey, brown, to black; in granularity from fine quartzite to coarse grits with interbeds of metamorphosed pebble conglomerate; in composition through admixture with varying amounts of dark argillaceous material; and in fissility either through variations in amount of mica developed in the rock or through the rock’s relation to the axial plane and minor folds. Individual beds, ranging from a fraction of an inch to several tens of feet in thickness, are interbedded with others which may vary in colour, granularity, and general composition.”
“Dominantly argillaceous rocks are considerably less common than quartzites. They are present as black slate and dark schistose quartzitic argillite, grey argillaceous schists, and as thin partings and interbeds of dark argillaceous material in a dominantly quartzitic succession. The grey colours of most quartzites are due to the variable content of dark argillaceous and, in some instances, graphitic material.”
“For the most part the rocks are not calcareous. The few thin limestone beds could not be traced for any great distance and their correlation was not possible. Many of the rocks have a low to moderate amount of carbonate mineral which, when determined, was found to be ankerite.”
“Green chloritic schists, some weathering brown and some exceedingly brightly coloured, are also present. Some chloritic schists contain thin layers and lenses of grey or white limestone. In several places pale, greenish-grey quartzite schists are exposed; their green caste evidently is a result of the development of small amounts of chlorite.”
“The rocks represent a sedimentary succession that has been subjected to regional metamorphism. Cleavage, in varying degrees of perfection, is developed in all rocks and is the result of the oriented development mainly of sericite and less commonly of chlorite. The perfection of the cleavage depends primarily on the initial composition of the rock and the amount of argillaceous material that was available to form mica. To a lesser extent the position of the rock in relation to the axial plane of a fold contributes to the degree to which the cleaner, more massive quartzites are cleaved.”
In respect to cleavage, the term, “flaggy quartzite” is mentioned by Holland, Johnston and Uglow. This terminology was a bit of a mystery to Mr.Reid, until examination, but now believes this term applies to rocks that are cleaved into relatively flat slabs, or “flagstone” like material. Mr.Reid, in his traverses, did not find a sufficient amount to be of commercial interest.
Deposit Types (from Gemco’s 2007 NI43-101 Technical Report)
There are currently four “types” of gold bearing “deposits” within the Cariboo Gold Mining District:
1.
Placer Deposits.
2.
Pyritic quartz veins in brittle rocks associated with northerly trending faults.
3.
Pyritic replacement deposits usually associated with folds in limestone and in close proximity to northerly striking faults
4.
Pyrite with barite and sericite in a hydrothermal event (Bonanza Ledge).
At the Burns Group property, the exploration focus is mainly on the north trending faults and proximal quartz veining. The north striking faults are an important control for the gold vein mineralization (Hall, 1999). Favorable stratigraphy for replacement deposits does exist at the Burns Group mineral claims and, though, exploration does focus on proximal veining to faults, Gemco Minerals Inc. is also exploring for replacement type deposits. The main commodities historically found and presently looked for by Gemco Minerals Inc. are gold and silver. Other commodities, to a lesser extent, include lead and zinc.
Quartz veining within the “camp” has historically been designated as either “A” veins (those being sub-parallel the north westerly trending strata and are usually of greater extent) “B” veins, which within the mines are either transverse (right angles to stratigraphy), or oblique, which cut stratigraphy but are at right angles to the northerly trending faults. The “B” veins have been interpreted as tension fracture filling possibly following the Riedel shear model. Skerl (1948) states that “continued movement [along the northerly trending faults] opened up both groups of these fractures enabling mineral solutions to invade the broken zones near both the north - south and the “bedded” faults and produce auriferous quartz-pyrite veins. Some mineralization took place within the faults themselves.”
Gemco Minerals Inc Exploration on the Property
Gemco commenced exploration on the Burns Mountain mineral claim group in June 2006 and has continued thereon. A crew was first deployed on the property with an excavator and supporting equipment, to conduct trenching and channel sampling in the anomalous area of the Foster’s East soil grid. Additional reconnaissance exploration was conducted and included a dip needle survey, self potential geophysical surveys, prospecting and rock geochemistry. Also in 2006, technical reports were submitted to the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources for assessment purposes. The most recent works on the property include the expansion of the Burns grid in preparation for further self potential geophysical surveying as well as trenching and sampling of previous self potential geophysical anomalies on that grid. Ground truthing and historical research in an effort to build the company’s GIS database and to expand the targeted areas of interest. Further, trail upgrade and drill pad construction at Foster’s East and Perkins Gulch will be conducted and geological mapping and prospecting is ongoing.
Other Properties
On Gemco’s two placer properties, firstly, the Hawk LPM (lease of placer minerals) is located near Barkerville, British Columbia and is recognized as a deep ground area, which will require extensive testing. Secondly, the Joytown LPM which is strategically located near the head of the historically famous Cunningham Creek. The previous property operator undertook some testing and found gold values that warrant a more extensive testing program. Both of these properties will require extensive testing prior to further mining activities.
