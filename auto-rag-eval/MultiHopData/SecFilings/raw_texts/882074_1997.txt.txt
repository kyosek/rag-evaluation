Item 2. Properties.
The Company has grown through the acquisition of producing properties and the subsequent application of advanced technology such as 3-D Seismic to exploit potential producing zones which have been overlooked or bypassed by previous operators.
Since 1990, the Company has made five acquisitions of producing properties for a total of $98.0 million, which properties had Proved Reserves of approximately 116 Bcfe as of their respective acquisition dates. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had Proved Reserves of 100.7 Bcfe with a SEC PV-10 of $129.0 million. Approximately 83% of the Company's total SEC PV-10 are classified as Proved Developed Reserves and approximately 73% of the Company's total Proved Reserves are natural gas.
The Company's primary producing properties are located along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana and offshore in the federal and state waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Company owns interests in a total of 255 oil wells and 356 natural gas wells. The Company owns interests in 20 federal blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and nine state water blocks and operates 55% of the 166 offshore wells, based upon the SEC PV-10 value as of December 31, 1997. The Company's non-operated offshore properties are operated by large independents and major oil companies, including Unocal, Phillips, Texaco, Coastal, Anadarko and Burlington. The 445 onshore wells account for 14.5% of the Company's total SEC PV-10 value as of December 31, 1997. The Company operates 55% of the onshore wells, based upon such SEC PV-10 value. The Company also owns interests in 22 offshore production platforms and 69 miles of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines with diameters of 10" or larger.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Company's significant properties as of December 31, 1997. These properties represent 83% of the aggregate SEC PV-10 value of the Company.
Umbrella Point Field
Since its discovery in 1957 by Sun Oil, the Umbrella Point Field has produced over 17 MMbbls of oil and 100 Bcf of natural gas from 35 wells. The Company owns 100% of the working interest in Texas State Leases 73,74,87 and 88 in Trinity Bay, Chambers County, Texas, that encompass the field. Field production is gathered on a small platform complex in approximately 10' of water and transported via a Company owned 5 mile oil pipeline to the Company's onshore production facility at Cedar Point. Gas production is transported through a Midcon Pipeline Co. of Texas pipeline.
The Umbrella Point Field consists of multiple stacked reservoirs. Production is from 13 main reservoirs from 7,700' to 9,000'. Prior to Goldking's control of the field, it was developed and produced by two different operators each controlling two state leases which created a competitive drainage situation. This situation resulted in several reservoirs that were abandoned prematurely as the former operators tried to accelerate production in uphole reservoirs. Consequently, significant development work remains to sufficiently drain the abandoned reservoirs. On January 21, 1998 the Company announced the successful completion of its first well in the Umbrella Point Field. The well flowed 11.5 MMcf and 220 barrels of condensate per day through a 20/64ths choke with flowing tubing pressure of 5,600 PSIG. The Company owns an 80% working interest in the well. The remaining 20% is owned by Midcon Gas Services Corp.
High Island 309 Field
The Company purchased its interest in the High Island Block A-309 Field from Amoco in October of 1996 and has a 50% working interest. The field consists of the High Island blocks A-309 and A-310 in approximately 200' of water. Production is from three faulted anticlines with 18 productive reservoirs. Coastal Oil and Gas Corp. operates this property and has conducted an evaluation of reprocessed proprietary 3-D Seismic surveys resulting in significant drilling activity in 1997. The Company has drilled new wells, sidetracked existing wells into new formations and recompleted existing wells in new formations. The field is currently producing 60 MMcf per day of natural gas and 77 Bbl per day of condensate compared to 15 MMcf per day and 6 Bbl per day of condensate at the beginning of 1997. The Company believes that continued review of the 3-D Seismic may result in additional development.
East Breaks 160 Field
The Company acquired a 33.3% interest in this field as part of the Amoco Acquisition in October 1996. The field consists of two federal offshore blocks, East Breaks 160 and 161, with a production platform set in 925' of water placing this production facility on the edge of deep water. The field is operated by Unocal and production is from 12 separate reservoirs. Unocal acquired proprietary 3-D Seismic over the field in 1990 and has identified the undeveloped locations. The Proved Developed Producing Reserve value is proportionately dispersed among eleven producing wells decreasing the risk to some degree. The undeveloped locations included are based on seismic interpretation of attic reserves. The facility also receives processing fees from Mobil Oil Corp. related to a subsea well drilled in Block 117. Because of the strategic location of the platform on the edge of deepwater, the facility has potential for additional processing and handling fees as more nearby discoveries are made and tied into the platform. In addition to the property interests acquired, the Company purchased a 33.3% interest in a 12.67 mile 12" natural gas pipeline connecting the East Breaks Block 160 platform to the High Island Offshore System ("HIOS") a natural gas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and a 33.3% interest in a 17.47 mile 10" oil pipeline connecting the platform to the High Island Pipeline System ("HIPS"), a crude oil pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico. Currently such firms as Exxon, Reading and Bates and Santa Fe Energy are actively exploring in the East Breaks Area and the Company believes that, due to the ongoing deepwater exploration in the Area, the Company's platform and pipelines will become long term strategic revenue generating assets after the field reserves are depleted.
West Delta Fields
These properties consist of 13,565 acres in Blocks 52 through 56 and Block 58 in the West Delta Area, offshore Louisiana. The West Delta Fields were acquired from Conoco, Inc., Atlantic Richfield Company (now Vastar Resources, Inc.), OXY USA, Inc. and Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. in May 1991.
The Company has an 87.5% net revenue interest in the field, subject to a 5% net profits interest on the shallower reservoirs in favor of the Company's former lenders and a 4.166% overriding royalty interest on the deeper reservoirs in favor of Conoco and OXY. The Company is the operator and generally owns 100% of the working interest in these wells. Presently, the properties have 36 wells, five of which were recently drilled, which produce from depths ranging from 1,200' to 12,500'. Because of the existing surface structures and production equipment, additional wells can be added on the properties with lower completion costs.
The main production facility on the West Delta Fields is a four platform complex designated as Tank Battery #3. There are three ancillary platforms and one three well production platform in the eastern portion of the properties connected to Tank Battery #3. In the western portion there is one production platform designated as Platform "D" in Block 58, with three wells. The remaining 30 wells are located on satellite structures connected to Tank Battery #3 or one of its ancillary platforms. Eight wells produce oil and natural gas, with the remaining wells producing only natural gas. In 1997 the Company replaced the pipeline connecting "D" Platform in Block 58 with Tank Battery #3 in Block 54 with two new 6" pipelines, and installed a new 4" pipeline connected "C" Platform with "D" Platform.
The field is characterized by multiple reservoirs with significant workover and recompletion potential. Proved producing reserves are based on an established consistent production history. The behind pipe reserves are generally uphole recompletions with reserves based on volumetric estimates. Currently there are no Proved Undeveloped Reserves assigned to the field. The Company has been historically successful increasing rates and reserves through the use of horizontal wells and coiled tubing operations. In 1994 the company drilled 4 horizontal wells in the field increasing production 34% and accelerating reserves. The Company is also using coiled tubing technology with increasing frequency to avoid costly rig workovers.
The Company has farmed out the deep rights in West Delta Blocks 53 through 56 to Ocean Energy, Inc. (formerly Flores & Rucks, Inc.) which has committed to fund a new 3-D Seismic survey. The Company retains all presently producing reservoirs and shallow horizons. The Company will have the option of retaining a 12 1/2% overriding royalty interest or participating up to 50% as a working interest owner in any wells drilled by Ocean Energy. Due to the complexity of the geology and the long history of production, the Company believes that the evaluation of the 3-D Seismic over the produced reservoirs will create significant additional development and exploitation opportunities. In addition the Company believes that evaluation of the deeper potential by Ocean Energy will create exploration opportunities with the Company having the option to limit capital exposure.
During 1994 the Company farmed out the deep rights (below 11,300') to an 1,875 acre parcel in Block 58 and sold "C" Platform to Energy Development Corporation which drilled a successful well to 16,500'. Production commenced in April, 1995. The Company has a 15% overriding royalty interest in that acreage. The well is currently producing 9,800 Mcf per day and 835 Bbls of condensate per day. Energy Development Corporation was subsequently acquired by Samedan Oil Corporation.
The Company generated a prospect in the northern portion of West Delta Block 58 using 3-D Seismic, which it farmed out to Tana Oil & Gas Corporation in 1996. Tana drilled a successful well to 12,800' which encountered 85' of net pay and is currently producing 12,300 Mcf per day. The Company retained an overriding royalty interest in the farmout, which was converted to a 25% working interest at payout on September 26, 1997.
In connection with the acquisition of the West Delta offshore properties the Company provides the sellers with a $4,100,000 plugging and abandonment bond collateralized in part with a bank escrow account. See "The Company - Plugging and Abandonment Escrows".
East Breaks 109 Field
The Company acquired a 100% interest in the East Breaks 109 Field from Zapata in July of 1995. The field consists of East Breaks Blocks 109 and 110. The Company operates this field which produces from six wellbores. There are no proved behind pipe or undeveloped reserves associated with the field. Over 90% of the field value are in the A-2 well completed in the TW-3 sand. This well is the last remaining producer in a large reservoir that has produced over 50 BCF. The A-2 well is currently making approximately 4,400 Mcf per day with no reported water production.
In addition to the mineral interests acquired, the Company purchased the 100% interest in a 31 mile 10" natural gas pipeline connecting the East Breaks 110 platform to the High Island Offshore System and a 22 mile 4" oil pipeline which connects the East Breaks 110 platform with the High Island Pipeline System. The HIOS and HIPS systems are the primary oil and natural gas pipelines in this region of the Gulf of Mexico.
The Company's East Breaks 110 platform has significant excess capacity for both crude oil and natural gas. Prior to the Company acquiring the property, Zapata had entered into a Facilities Sharing Agreement with AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc. ("AGIP") to operate and process for AGIP's subsea wells in Blocks 112 and 157. Under the agreement AGIP pays certain fees to the Company and split the cost of operating the East Breaks 110 platform with the Company, based on each company's proportion of the production. A portion, not to exceed $6 million, of the monies earned pursuant to this agreement is being paid to Zapata as part of the acquisition of the properties.
The purchase price for the Zapata properties included a production payment to Zapata based upon future production from the East Breaks 109 Field after production of 12 Bcfe gross (10 Bcfe net) measured from October 1, 1994. The Company will pay to Zapata $.4167 per Mcfe on the next 27 Bcfe of gross production, if that much is produced. The Company's oil and natural gas reserves are stated net of this production payment.
Other Properties
Great River/Fort St. Phillips Fields. The Company acquired the Great River (33 1/3% working interest) and Fort St. Phillips (43 1/3% working interest) Fields as part of the Goldking acquisition. The Company operates both properties, which total 1,688 acres and are geologically located on the same fault and only two miles apart. These fields are low relief anticlinal structures with stacked reservoirs from 7,600' to 10,000'. The reserves are spread over three active completions in two zones. Behind pipe reserves were assigned to four sands considering analogous performance. The Proved Undeveloped reserves that have been identified in the fields represent attic gas accumulations. New shallow sands and deeper pay were encountered with the SL #14645 #1 re-entry well. More wells are being considered to further develop the shallow and deep pay sands.
High Island A-302 Field. High Island Block A-302 acquired from Amoco in 1996 is in approximately 200' of water. The Company owns a 33.3% working interest and Unocal Corporation is the operator. Production is from four producing horizons on a faulted anticlinal structure. A speculative 3-D survey was shot in 1991 and processed in 1992.
High Island A-330 Field. The field consists of three blocks, High Island A-330, High Island A-349 and West Cameron 613, located in 280' of water. The Company owns a 12% working interest , which it acquired from Amoco in 1996. Coastal Oil and Gas Corporation is the operator. Three wells were recompleted in 1996. This field produces from a faulted anticline with 24 productive horizons. Significant upside potential was delineated by a recently shot 3-D Seismic survey. A well in West Cameron Block 613 has been proposed by the operator for 1998 to offset a field operated by Shell Offshore in Block A-350.
High Island A-474 Field. This field consists of three full blocks in the High Island Area, A-474, A-489, A-499, and part of Block A- 475. The water depth is 250' to 285' and Phillips Petroleum Company is the operator. In 1996 the Company acquired from Amoco a 12% working interest in Blocks A-474 and A-489, a 13.1% working interest in Block A-499, and a 12% working interest in Block A-475. There are 23 productive horizons in this faulted anticline. A proprietary 3-D Seismic survey was shot in 1991 and processed in 1993.
West Cameron 180 Field. This field consists of a single block, West Cameron 144, in 40' of water. Texaco is the operator. The Company acquired its 12.5% working interest from Amoco in 1996. The producing feature is a north-plunging faulted anticline that underlies West Cameron Blocks 173 and 180. There are three productive horizons. A new well was completed in January 1998 and is producing 17 MMcf and 250 barrels of condensate per day.
East Cameron Block 359. The Company acquired its 30.7% working interest in this field from Zapata in 1995. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. is the operator. The property has eight wells and is in 330' of water. The platform also handles production for a nearby field owned by others.
Eugene Island Block 372. This field was acquired in 1995 from Zapata. Unocal Corp. is the operator and the Company owns a 25% working interest. The property has seven wells and is in 414' of water.
South Timbalier 185. The Company acquired this field in 1995 from Zapata. The Company owns a 7.7% working interest and Burlington Resources, Inc. is the operator. The property has eleven wells and is in 180' of water. One of the partners, Hall-Houston Oil Co., has proposed a 14,500' exploratory well on the block, to be drilled in 1998.
West Cameron Block 538. This field is operated by the Company and it owns a 35.3% working interest. The property was acquired from Zapata in 1995. It has six wells and is located in 194' of water. Oil and Gas Information

Title to Oil and Gas Properties
In the case of acquired properties title opinions are obtained for the more significant properties. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations a thorough drill site title examination is conducted and curative work performed with respect to significant defects.
Unproved Properties
The Company retained a 3% overriding royalty interest in depths that are below 11,000' when it sold the Bayou Sorrel Field to National Energy Group, Inc. Two successful wells were drilled to these depths from which the company derives revenue. In connection with the Amoco and Goldking acquisitions, the Company acquired what management believes to be further reserve potential, not quantified in its proved reserve evaluations, generally at greater depths than previously developed. A portion of the respective purchase prices was allocated to these unproved properties.
Gas Plant
The Company owns an approximate 1% interest in the Yscloskey Gas Plant, a joint venture operation with Warren Petroleum serving as operator for 30 producer/owners. The plant is located in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, on state highway 46. It is a steam plant of refrigerated absorption oil design with a rated gas throughput of 1,850 million cubic feet of gas per day. It generates its own power with four 2,500-kilowatt steam driven generators. Inlet gas is transported from field delivery points throughout southeastern Louisiana and offshore Gulf of Mexico by Tennessee Gas Pipeline and residue is returned back to the pipeline. Sixty percent of the liquid production, plus all the ethane, is delivered by pipeline to Shell Norco Fractionation Plant. The remaining forty percent, less ethane, is delivered by pipeline to the Western Gas Resources Plant at Toca for fractionation.
The original plant was built in 1962 with a design throughput of 650 million cubic feet per day. In 1970 a second complete new plant was built with a design of 1,850 million cubic feet per day. In 1975 an extension process was added to the new plant and the ethane recovery unit was put in Plant "B." The plant is processing about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day with an average production of 29,000 barrels per day of total liquids.
