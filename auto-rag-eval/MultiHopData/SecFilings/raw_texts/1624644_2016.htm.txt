Item 2. Properties
Property Overview
Our Appalachian Basin properties are primarily located in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio. The following illustrations depict our acreage position in the Appalachian Basin of our Exploration and Production segment and the midstream assets of our Rice Midstream Holdings and the Rice Midstream Partners segments, each as of December 31, 2016. In addition to our acreage position in the Appalachian Basin, we own acreage in the Fort Worth Basin located in Northern Texas, the Uinta Basin located in eastern Utah and the Piceance Basin located in northwestern Colorado.
The majority of our properties are located on or under private properties owned in fee, held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired without warranty of underlying land titles.
Exploration and Production Segment Properties
The vast majority of the current and planned operations of our Exploration and Production segment are located in the cores of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin. In addition, we have operations in the Upper Devonian Shale and Utica Shale on our Pennsylvania acreage as well as the Barnett Shale on our Texas acreage. The properties of our Exploration and Production segment consist of interests in developed and undeveloped leases that entitle us to drill for and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, royalty and overriding royalty interests.
The table below summarizes data for our Exploration and Production segment for the year ended December 31, 2016.
(1)
Marcellus Shale production for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 148.7 Bcfe and 89.6 Bcfe, respectively.
(2)
Ohio Utica Shale production for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 50.2 Bcfe and 6.9 Bcfe, respectively.
(3)
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any production in the Uinta and Piceance Basins located in eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, respectively, which we acquired in connection with the Vantage Acquisition.
(4)
Our acreage position in the Barnett Shale was acquired in 2016; therefore, we did not record any production for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Reserve Data
The information with respect to our estimated reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Reserves Presentation
Our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are based on evaluations prepared by our independent reserve engineers, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”). A copy of the summary reports of NSAI with respect to our reserves as of December 31, 2016 are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Annual Report. See “-Preparation of Reserve Estimates” for definitions of proved reserves and the technologies and economic data used in their estimation.
The following table summarizes our historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
(1)
As our oil and NGLs reserves are immaterial and constitute approximately one percent of our proved reserves at December 31, 2016, we present our reserves on an Mcfe basis calculated at the rate of one barrel per six Mcf based upon the relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which may not be indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.
(2)
Our historical estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure were determined using a historical 12-month average price for natural gas from each respective date (determined as the unweighted arithmetic acreage of prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period). The prices used in our reserve report yield weighted average wellhead prices, which are based on index prices and adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and regional basis differentials. The index prices and the equivalent wellhead prices are shown in the table below.
(3)
In connection with the Vantage Acquisition, we acquired acreage located in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas and in the Uinta and Piceance Basins located in eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any proved reserves in the Uinta and Piceance Basins.
(4)
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Our pre-tax PV-10 at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.6 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that our historical standardized measure as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is approximately $1.6 billion, $0.9 billion, $1.3 billion respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately zero, zero and $436 million, respectively, of future income taxes. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities.
(5)
Information presented for 2015 and 2014 relates to our estimated proved reserves in the Appalachian Basin.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated historical proved undeveloped reserves during 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in Bcfe):
(1)
As of December 31, 2016, management is evaluating our long-term approach in the Barnett, Uinta and Piceance Shales, and development in these areas is not included in our 5-year development plan. As a result, the table above does not include proved undeveloped reserves associated with the Barnett, Uinta and Piceance Shales.
During 2016, extensions of 1,118.0 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were added through the drillbit in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Extensions of approximately 549.8 Bcfe within the December 31, 2016 proved developed producing and proved developed non-producing reserves relate to the conversion of probable and possible wells in the current year that were not included within our 2015 proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. We acquired proved undeveloped reserves of 237.2 Bcfe within the Marcellus Shale. Net negative revisions of 43.4 Bcfe were primarily related to 118.7 Bcfe of negative revisions attributable to reclassifications of previously booked locations that were no longer expected to be drilled within the upcoming five-year period, which were partially offset primarily by extended lateral lengths. We incurred cumulative costs of approximately $119.0 million, of which $91.0 million was incurred in 2016, to convert 170.5 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in 2016. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 are approximately $1.1 billion over the next five years, which we expect to finance through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and other sources of capital financing. Our drilling programs are focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through delineation drilling. While we will continue to drill leasehold delineation wells and build on our current leasehold position, we will also focus on drilling our proved undeveloped reserves. Based on our reserve report as of December 31, 2016, we had 109 and 34 net drilling locations associated with proved undeveloped reserves in the Marcellus and Utica Shale, respectively, and 18 and 11 net drilling locations associated with proved developed not producing reserves in the Marcellus and Utica Shale, respectively. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of their initial booking date. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.”
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in this Annual Report were based on evaluations prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firm of NSAI in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. Our independent reserve engineers were selected for their historical experience and geographic expertise in engineering unconventional resources.
Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. The technical and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, well-test data, production data (including flow rates), well data (including lateral lengths), historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. Our independent reserve engineers use this technical data, together with standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy. The proved developed reserves and EURs per well are estimated using performance analysis and volumetric analysis. The estimates of the proved developed reserves and EURs for each developed well are used to estimate the proved undeveloped reserves for each proved undeveloped location (utilizing type curves, statistical analysis, and analogy). Proved undeveloped locations that are more than one offset from a proved developed well utilized reliable technologies to confirm reasonable certainty. The reliable technologies that were utilized in estimating these reserves include log data, performance data, log cross sections, seismic data, core data, and statistical analysis.
Internal Controls
Rice Energy maintains an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to NSAI in their reserves estimation process. Ryan I. Kanto, Rice Energy’s Vice President of Asset Performance, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has substantial industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Throughout each fiscal year, Rice Energy’s technical team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process, a preliminary copy of the reserve report is reviewed by Rice Energy’s senior management with representatives of our independent reserve engineers and internal technical staff.
Qualifications of Responsible Technical Persons
Ryan I. Kanto joined Rice Energy in June 2011 and serves as Rice Energy’s Vice President of Asset Performance. Prior to Rice Energy, Mr. Kanto worked at EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. from June 2007 to May 2011. During this time, he served as a facilities engineer in the Deep Bossier from June 2007 to January 2008, a reservoir engineer in the Barnett Shale until February 2009, and completion engineer in the Haynesville Shale until his departure. Mr. Kanto has bachelor’s degrees in Chemical Engineering and Engineering Management from the University of Arizona and has significant experience in unconventional shale gas plays.

Determination of Drilling Locations
Net undeveloped locations are calculated by taking our total net acreage, subtracting producing acreage, and multiplying such amount by a risking factor. Remaining risked acreage is then divided by our expected well spacing. Producing acreage is calculated with the same methodology based on actual lateral lengths and inter-well spacing.
•
Undeveloped Net Marcellus Locations - We assume these locations have 8,000 foot laterals and 750 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 138 acre spacing. In the Marcellus, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization and the risk associated with our inability to force pool in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 185,000 net acres in the Marcellus which results in 861 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Ohio Utica Locations - We assume these locations have 9,000 foot laterals and 1,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 207 acre spacing. In the Ohio Utica, we apply a 10% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 63,000 net acres prospective for the Utica in Ohio which results in 241 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Upper Devonian Locations - We assume these locations have 8,000 foot laterals and 1,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 184 acre spacing. In the Upper Devonian, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization and the risk associated with our inability to force pool in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 108,000 net acres prospective for the Upper Devonian which results in 464 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Pennsylvania Utica Locations - We assume these locations have 8,000 foot laterals and 2,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 367 acre spacing. In the Pennsylvania Utica, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 105,000 net acres prospective for the Utica in Pennsylvania which results in 228 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Barnett Locations - These are mapped locations that we have deemed to have a high likelihood of producing economic quantities of hydrocarbons. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 36,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale, which results in 171 undeveloped net locations.
The drilling locations on which we actually drill will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approval, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our drilling locations.”
Production, Revenues and Price History
Natural gas, NGLs, and oil are commodities; therefore, the price that we receive for our production is largely a function of market supply and demand. While demand for natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically since 2000, natural gas and NGL supplies have also increased significantly as a result of horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation technologies which have been used to find and recover large amounts of oil and natural gas from various shale formations throughout the United States. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, weather and other seasonal conditions. Over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and Rice Energy’s ability to access capital markets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.”
The following table sets forth information regarding our natural gas, oil and NGL production in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and in the Barnett Shale for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016.
(1)
Includes natural gas production in the Upper Devonian Shale.
(2)
As our oil and NGLs production is immaterial and constitutes approximately one percent of our total production for the periods presented, we present our total production on an Mcfe basis calculated at the rate of one barrel per six Mcf based upon the relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which may not be indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.
The following table sets forth information regarding revenues, realized prices and production costs in the Appalachian Basin for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and in the Fort Worth Basin for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016.
(1)
The effect of hedges includes realized gains and losses on commodity derivative transactions
(2)
As our oil and NGL revenues are immaterial and constitute approximately one percent of our total revenues for the periods presented, we present these results on an Mcfe basis calculated at the rate of one barrel per six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which may not be indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.
Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 370 gross (282 net) producing wells in the Appalachian Basin, consisting of (i) 248 gross (229 net) producing wells in the Marcellus Shale, (ii) 114 gross (45 net) producing wells in the Utica Shale, which includes one gross and net Utica Shale producing well and (iii) 8 gross and net producing wells in the Upper Devonian Shale. In addition, we had 176 gross (140 net) producing wells in the Barnett Shale. This well count excludes approximately 100 gross (100 net) shallow vertical wells located in the Appalachian Basin.
Acreage
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the total developed and undeveloped acreage in which we own an interest as of December 31, 2016. Approximately 57% of our Marcellus acreage, 24% of our Utica acreage and 95% of our Barnett acreage was held by production at December 31, 2016. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests is excluded from this table.
(1)
Marcellus acreage associated with the Vantage Acquisition included 23,217 gross (23,217 net) developed acres and 62,014 gross (62,014 net) undeveloped acres.
(2)
Excludes approximately 11,000 gross (8,500 net) developed acres and 17,000 gross (1,000 net) undeveloped acres in the Uinta and Piceance Basins located in eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, which we acquired in connection with the Vantage Acquisition.
Undeveloped Acreage Expirations
The following table sets forth the number of total undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2016 that will expire in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and thereafter unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates or unless such leasehold rights are extended or renewed. We have not attributed any PUD reserves to acreage for which the expiration date precedes the scheduled date for PUD drilling. In addition, we do not anticipate material delay rental or lease extension payments in connection with such acreage.
(1)
As of December 31, 2016, management is evaluating our long-term approach in the Barnett, Uinta and Piceance Shales, and development in these areas is not included in our 5-year development plan. As a result, the table above does not include acreage expirations associated with our Uinta and Piceance Shale acreage.
Operated Drilling Activity
The following table describes our drilling activity on our acreage during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
(1)
Excludes 14 gross (14 net) producing wells acquired in the Vantage Acquisition.
We drilled no developmental dry wells or exploratory wells during 2016, no developmental dry wells and no exploratory wells during 2015 and no developmental dry wells and four exploratory wells in 2014.
Title to Properties
In the course of acquiring the rights to develop oil and natural gas, it is standard procedure for us and the lessor to execute a lease agreement with payment subject to title verification. In most cases, we incur the expense of retaining lawyers to verify the rightful owners of the oil and gas interests prior to payment of such lease bonus to the lessor. There is no certainty, however, that a lessor has valid title to its lease’s oil and gas interests. In those cases, such leases are generally voided and payment is not remitted to the lessor. As such, title failures may result in fewer net acres to us. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include:
•
customary royalty interests;
•
liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes;
•
obligations or duties under applicable laws;
•
development obligations under natural gas leases; or
•
net profits interests.
Midstream Segments Properties
The gathering, compression and fresh water distribution systems of our Rice Midstream Holdings segment and Rice Midstream Partners segment are located in the core of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, our Rice Midstream Partners segment owned gas gathering systems and compression assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and fresh water distribution systems in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio, and our Rice Midstream Holdings segment owned gathering systems and compression assets in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio.
Rice Midstream Holdings Segment
As of December 31, 2016, our Ohio gathering system consists of a network of 92 miles of gathering pipelines and 18,960 horsepower of compression used to compress natural gas for our Exploration and Production segment and third-party customers. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, our Ohio gathering system had approximately 4.8 MMDth/d of gathering capacity in the core of the Utica Shale in Belmont County, Ohio. Average daily throughput on our Ohio gathering system for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 708 MDth/d, which consisted of 700 MDth/d related to the operations of Rice Olympus Midstream LLC (“Rice Olympus Midstream”) and 260 MDth/d related to the operations of Strike Force Midstream, slightly offset by an elimination of 252 Mdth/d that is related to operations of both Rice Olympus Midstream and Strike Force Midstream. The Rice Olympus Midstream system services approximately 45,000 and 20,000 net acres of our and Gulfport’s current positions respectively, in Belmont County, Ohio.
On February 1, 2016, Strike Force Holdings, our indirect subsidiary, and Gulfport Midstream, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulfport, entered into the Strike Force LLC Agreement of Strike Force Midstream to engage in the natural gas midstream business in the Strike Force Midstream AMI. As of December 31, 2016, Strike Force Midstream accounted for 260 MDth/d of our average daily throughput on our Ohio gathering system. The Strike Force Midstream system currently services an aggregate of approximately 98,000 acres of Gulfport’s and Consol Energy Inc.’s positions.
Rice Midstream Partners Segment
As of December 31, 2016, RMP’s gathering systems consist of a network of 159 miles of gathering pipelines and 59,500 horsepower of compression used to compress natural gas for our Exploration and Production segment and third-party producers. As of December 31, 2016, RMP’s systems had approximately 4.1 MMDth/d of gathering capacity with connections to Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission, Equitrans Transmission and National Fuel Gas Supply interstate pipelines, and were connected to 242 producing Appalachian wells located in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania. The Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition enhanced RMP’s Greene County gathering system with the acquisition of approximately 30 miles of dry gas gathering and compression assets.
RMP has secured dedications from us under a 15 year, fixed-fee contract for gathering and compression services covering (i) approximately 186,000 gross acres of our acreage position as of December 31, 2016 in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and (ii) any future acreage we acquire within these counties, excluding certain production subject to a pre-existing third-party dedication. We have also granted RMP the exclusive right to provide certain fluid handling services to us until December 22, 2029 and from month to month thereafter. The fluid handling services include the exclusive right to provide fresh water for well completions operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for us within areas of dedication in defined service areas in Pennsylvania and Ohio. In addition, RMP has secured dedications from third-party customers under fixed-fee contracts for gathering and compression services in Washington County, Pennsylvania with respect to approximately 29,000 of their existing gross acres, and any future acreage they may acquire within areas of mutual interest of approximately 66,000 acres.
Water Services
RMP’s water services assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio are engaged in the provision of water services to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for us and third parties in the Appalachian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, RMP’s Pennsylvania assets provided access to 22.5 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Monongahela River and several other regional water sources, and RMP’s Ohio assets provided access to 14.0 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Ohio River and several other regional sources, both for distribution to our Exploration and Production segment and third parties.
Title to Properties
The real property tied to our midstream operations is classified into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. We have leased or owned these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership of such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of its material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
Item 3.
