ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Properties consist of 19 high quality MOBs and an adjacent parking facility. As of January 31, 1998, the Properties were approximately 93.8% leased to over 300 tenants. The Company's tenants are primarily established medical practitioners representing a cross section of medical practices.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTIES AND TENANTS
Company Properties
The Company, through its MOB operations, acquires, develops, manages and leases medical office buildings and related health care facilities. Developing and managing medical office properties differs from developing and managing conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of the tenants and their patients. Because doctors now perform a variety of medical procedures in their offices, many MOBs have become sophisticated ambulatory centers that allow for out-patient surgery and procedures. In addition, medical office buildings generally have higher maintenance requirements in the public areas due to heavy foot traffic, many short appointments which increase demand on parking facilities, the use of sophisticated medical equipment requiring increased plumbing and electrical capacity and expanded environmental regulations that impose more stringent restrictions on the disposal of medical waste. The management of medical office properties also generally requires experience in specialized tenant improvements and higher levels of responsiveness required by medical practitioners. Additional important management functions include the placement of tenants within medical office properties to accommodate increased space needs and managing the tenant mix at properties to facilitate referrals by practitioners with different specialties within the building. The Company stresses meeting these and other special demands of medical property tenants.
The health care industry is facing various challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure to reduce medical delivery costs. Substantially all of the Company's tenants are in the medical profession and could be adversely affected by cost containment and other health care reform proposals. Proposals that limit access to medical care or reduce the reimbursement of physicians' services may impact the ability of the Company's tenants to pay rent. The Company believes that the aging population in the United States, combined with other recent trends in the health care industry, such as the performance of non-acute procedures outside of hospitals, could spur increased demand for space in full service MOBs which contain surgery centers and out-patient facilities, such as those owned by the Company.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding each of the Properties as of January 31, 1998.

LEASES
MOB Properties
As of January 31, 1998, the Properties were approximately 93.8% leased. New leases and extensions are normally granted for a minimum of five years and provide for annual rent increases. Office tenants generally have gross leases whereby rents may be adjusted for a tenant's proportionate share of any increases in the cost of operating the building. Most retail tenants have net leases and pay their share of all operating expenses including property taxes and insurance. The following is a lease expiration table setting forth the number, square feet and associated annual rent for those leases expiring in future years.
MOBS--LEASE EXPIRATIONS
______________________________
1) Does not include month-to-month leases, or vacant space. There are 53 month- to-month tenants who occupy approximately 58,000 square feet of space and pay approximately $88,000 per month in rent. 2) Percentage of Total Annual Rent is based upon annualized revenues of $19,845,108. Percent of Total Annual Rent has been rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent. 3) Includes the 36,787 sq. ft. lease with St. John's Hospital. St. John's Hospital has subleased approximately 75% of this space to third-party doctors. These subleases constitute an aggregate of approximately $101,000 in current monthly rental payments. If St. John's does not extend its option to renew, the Company will assume these existing subleases when the lease with Saint John's Hospital expires March 31, 1998.
The Company was successful in obtaining lease renewals, achieving a weighted average renewal rate of approximately 87.3% on medical office leases which expired during 1997. Although there can be no assurances that such renewal level will be maintained, the Company believes this high renewal rate is due in part to the tendency of medical practitioners to continue to practice in the same space over a number of years. Also, the Company's tenants frequently invest large sums of money in equipment and fixtures for their offices. Furthermore, relocating a doctor's office can be disruptive to the patients who are familiar with the doctor's office location.
The following table sets forth the scheduled annual rent increases for the leases with respect to the Properties in effect at December 31, 1997.
MOBS--RENT INCREASES

SENIOR CARE OPERATIONS
Lending Operations
The Company, through its Senior Care operations, makes mortgage loans secured by Senior Care Facilities. Many of the loans are intended to serve as bridge or interim financing (generally 6 to 24 months) for the acquisition of such facilities by joint ventures in which the Company participates or by third parties. The maturity of the loan made by the Company is determined primarily by the timing of the sale of tax exempt bonds or the completion of permanent financing by the buyer. The Company has from time to time extended the maturity dates of outstanding loans to give borrowers additional time to obtain permanent financing and taken a participation interest in such loans upon maturity in lieu of full debt repayment in the form of cash. Loans made by the Company generally bear interest at fixed rates, with the per annum interest rate increasing under certain circumstances in which an extension of the original maturity date is required due to the timing and availability of financing. The Company may receive fees and certain other consideration for making the loans.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company has fourteen loans outstanding which total approximately $14.1 million. Four of the fourteen loans, which total approximately $10.5 million, are first deeds of trust secured by healthcare facilities in Maryland, Oregon and Idaho which are described in the following paragraphs.
On June 17, 1996, the Company funded a $6.1 million loan for the acquisition of a nursing home facility in Baltimore, Maryland (the "Carroll Manor Facility") by Heritage Care, Inc. ("Heritage Care"), a non-profit corporation. The Company holds a first deed of trust in that facility and Carroll Manor, Inc. ("Carroll Manor"), the seller, holds a second deed of trust which secures its $500,000 loan to Heritage Care. Heritage Care is currently in default under the $6.1 Million Loan, which matured on March 31, 1997 (including loan extensions) and which currently bears interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum (the default rate). In addition to the $6.1 million, the Company made additional advances in 1997, which total $2.6 million, to enable Heritage Care to meet its payroll and other current expenses necessary to remain in operation and thereby protect the value of the Company's security interest in the Carroll Manor facility. The additional advances are secured by the Company's first deed of trust pursuant to the language thereof and are therefore secured loans, although they are subordinate in priority to the $500,000 second trust deed in favor of Carroll Manor. Recently the Carroll Manor facility was appraised for $11.0 million and the Company is currently reviewing its exit strategies with respect to the loan to Heritage Care, which include the possibility of (i) causing the transfer of the Carroll Manor facility to another non-profit entity that could obtain long- term financing to replace the existing indebtedness or (ii) taking title to the facility through foreclosure and subsequently leasing it to an operator or selling it to a third party.
The Company funded a short-term loan secured by a deed of trust in the amount of approximately $1.9 million secured by a nursing home in Oregon (the "Coos Bay Facility"). This loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 650 basis points per annum and matures on February 1, 1998, subject to extensions. This loan provides for monthly interest-only payments. As of March 1997, the borrower has exercised it options to extend the loan and is current on all monthly interest and extension fees due under the loan agreement. At maturity, assuming no prepayments, $1.9 million will be due on this loan. This loan permits prepayment on any monthly payment date of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan, without penalty, upon not less than five days' prior written notice to the Company of the borrower's intent to repay. As of March 20, 1998, the Coos Bay Facility was 92.0% occupied and leased to Coos Bay Rehabilitation, Inc. under a 10-year net operating lease that provides for two five-year extension options. The operator of this facility possesses all licenses necessary for its operation.
The Company has also funded two short-term loans secured by first deeds of trusts for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.0 million secured by two nursing homes in Burley and Idaho Falls, Idaho (the "Idaho Facilities"). These loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 650 basis points per annum and mature on April 1, 1998, subject to extensions. These loans provide for monthly interest-only payments. At maturity, assuming no prepayments, approximately $870,000 and $115,000, respectively, will be due on these loans. These loans permit prepayment on any monthly payment date of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan without penalty, upon not less than five days' prior written notice to the Company of the borrower's intent to repay As of March 20,
1998, the Idaho Facilities were 68.0% and 63.0% occupied, respectively, and leased to Kimburida Management Group under five-year net operating leases that provide for two five-year extension options.
During 1997, the Company commenced legal actions to protect its interests on loans secured by facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Phoenix, Arizona. The actions taken with respect to these two facilities are described in the following paragraphs.
In June 1997, the Company took title to a 98-bed facility located in Phoenix, Arizona (the Maryland Gardens Facility") through a deed in lieu of foreclosure on a first trust deed the Company had previously funded on this property. At the time the Company acquired title to the facility, the loan balance approximated the appraised value of 4.7 million.
On April 25, 1996, the Company entered into a loan participation agreement with Iatros to fund two loans secured by third and fifth trust deeds in the amount of approximately $750,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, to facilitate the purchase of a nursing home in Olathe, Kansas (the "Crystal Park Facility"). Following the acquisition of the Crystal Park Facility, the borrower engaged an affiliate of Iatros to operate the facility. On May 16, 1997, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and engaged a new operator for the Crystal Park Facility, which has since closed. As of September 30, 1997, the Company's interest in the third and fifth trust deeds was approximately $1.3 million, including principal (at face value) and accrued, unpaid interest. In October 1997, the Company assigned its remaining interest in the participation agreement and the promissory notes to Iatros in exchange for a $800,000 note and title to the accounts receivable of the former owner of the facility which had served as additional collateral for the promissory notes and which Iatros has guaranteed to have a net realizable value of approximately $400,000. The $800,000 note is due October 1, 2004 and accrues interest at 10.0% per annum. Payments are due monthly based upon 5.0% per annum of the outstanding balance.
In addition to the notes on the Carroll Manor Facility, Coos Bay Facility and Idaho Facilities and the $800,000 note due from Iatros, the Company had nine other loans outstanding at December 31, 1997, with an aggregate face value of $2,364,000, excluding approximately $100,000 of additional accrued, unpaid interest. The following is a summary of the nine other loans as of December 31, 1997:
. $150,000 note secured by second deed of trust, interest payable semiannually at a rate of 10.0% per annum. . $300,000 unsecured note receivable due May 31, 1999, interest payable quarterly at 9.0% per annum. . $47,000 unsecured note receivable due January 23, 1998, interest accrues at 14.0% per annum. . $7,000 unsecured note receivable due February 1, 2006, interest payable semiannually at 12.0%. . $500,000 unsecured promissory note due December 31, 1997, interest payable at 5.25% per annum (paid off in January 1998). . $300,000 unsecured credit line due May 31, 1998, interest payable annually at 12.0% per annum. . $270,000 secured promissory note due October 15, 1998, interest accrues at 18.0% per annum. . $540,000 secured promissory note due December 31, 1999, interest accrues at 18.0% per annum. . $250,000 unsecured promissory note due April 7, 1998 (the extended due date), interest payable monthly at the greater of 11.0% or 30-day LIBOR plus 6.5% per annum.
Due to uncertainties, related to the Company's portfolio of mortgage loans and bonds receivable, the Company increased its reserves for doubtful notes receivable from $375,000 at the end of 1996 to $825,000 as of December 31, 1997. Management believes that $825,000 is appropriate in relation to the status of the loans in the Company's portfolio as of March 20, 1998.
HUD Loan Servicing
The Company has received authorization from HUD to originate and service HUD- insured loans. The HUD program provides loan guarantees for the long-term financing of health care properties, including Senior Care Facilities. The Company believes that this authorization enhances the Company's ability to fund long-term financing which it is not able to provide through GLN Capital. The Company believes that this new source of financing provides an important exit- strategy for its own Senior Care loan program by providing long-term financing vehicles at competitive interest rates.
GLN Capital
GLN Capital markets two different loan products: a short-term loan and a participating loan. The short-term loan is a purchase-money mortgage designed for stabilized facilities that enables buyers to close an acquisition quickly without the delays inherent in a bond financing transaction. The typical loan is for approximately 12 months and is generally repaid from the proceeds of a bond offering. GLN Capital earns points as well as interest on these loans. The participating loans generally have a 24-month horizon and involve facilities in which management believes there is an opportunity to create value in a project, often because the facilities are in a turnaround situation. The participating loans enable GLN Capital to participate in gains resulting from such turnarounds in addition to the standard points and interest.
GLN Capital funded its first loan in February 1997, providing $6.4 million for the acquisition of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The loan is a participating mortgage that carries an 18-month term, has an interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 6.5% and is secured by a first deed of trust. The borrower, CoreCare Behavioral Management, operates a 162-bed psychiatric facility on the property and leases the balance of the property to third parties. In February 1998, the borrower repaid the loan including additional interest of approximately $700,000 in excess of monthly interest payments of $60,000 paid during the term of the loan.
In March 1997, the Company sold Series A and B bonds issued by the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency, Inc., which were secured by the Hampden Properties, to GLN Capital for $21.7 million. The Hampden Bonds, which were purchased for $19.9 million in October 1995, had an outstanding balance of $27.7 million at the time of the sale, including principal (at face value) and accrued unpaid interest. In October 1997, the Company acquired the Hampden Properties for approximately $20.0 million. Concurrently with this transaction, the seller of the Hampden Properties paid $22.7 million, a discount of approximately $5.0 million, to GLN Capital in full satisfaction of the outstanding balance on the Hampden Bonds.
In May 1997 GLN Capital acquired a 50% limited partnership interest in a limited partnership created to acquire a recreational vehicle (''RV'') park in Florida. The RV park was acquired by the limited partnership for approximately $1.2 million. In connection with the acquisition of the RV park, GLN Capital funded a secured loan of approximately $1.5 million to the limited partnership. This loan bears interest at a rate of approximately 9.0% per annum, matures on May 1, 1999, and provides for monthly payments of interest only. At maturity, the full $1.5 million will be due. The RV park is operated by Camper Clubs of America, Inc., (''Camper Clubs'') the largest RV park operator in the U.S. and a limited partner in the limited partnership, pursuant to a management agreement under which Camper Clubs receives a fee equal to 5% of gross revenues generated by the RV park. This management agreement is terminable at will by either party, upon thirty days' written notice to the other party.
INSURANCE
The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to the Properties. There are certain types of losses which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable; moreover, there can be no assurance that policies maintained by the Company will be adequate in the
event of a loss. The Company carries earthquake and flood insurance for coverage of losses up to $20 million on its portfolio of properties located in California and Arizona. This coverage is subject to a 10% deductible up to the amount of insured loss. Fifteen of the 22 properties directly owned by the Company are located in Southern California, which has a history of seismic activity, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake that damaged the Holy Cross Medical Plaza property. One property directly owned by the Company is located in Phoenix, Arizona, which is located in an area with a history of flood activity. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in, and anticipated earnings and cash flow from, a Property.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Environmental Matters. Under various Federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in its property. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to borrow using the real estate as collateral and may subject the owner to material remediation costs. All of the Properties have been subject to Phase I environmental assessments (which involve inspection of the subject property, but no soil sampling or groundwater analysis) by independent environmental consultants. Although restricted in scope, these independent assessments revealed no material evidence of existing environmental liability, and the Company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any noncompliance by, liability for, or other claim against the Company in connection with environmental matters related to the Properties. While the Company is not aware of any environmental liability that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its business, assets or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the environmental assessments revealed all potential environmental liabilities or that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to the Company or that future uses or conditions (including changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations) will not result in imposition of environmental liability.
The independent environmental assessments include selective sampling for asbestos where the age of the buildings or the types of materials warranted such sampling. Limited quantities of non-friable asbestos were present in the Sherman Oaks Medical Plaza. The Company removed the asbestos in 1994 in connection with the renovation of this building. Limited quantities of non- friable asbestos were also discovered in the Maryland Gardens Facility and Riverdale Gardens Nursing Home. Management believes that it has undertaken adequate measures to ensure that the asbestos will remain undisturbed and that it does not pose a current health risk. Management plans to continue to monitor this situation.
As part of the normal practice of doctors, medical waste is generated. The Company's leases require the individual tenants to make arrangements for the disposal of medical waste and requires all tenants to provide proof that they have contracted with a third party service to remove waste from the premises each night. The handling and disposal of this waste is the responsibility of the tenants; however, the Company remains responsible as the owner of the property. There can be no assurances that all such medical waste will be properly handled and disposed of or that the Company will not incur costs in connection with improper disposal of medical waste by its tenants.
Americans with Disabilities Act. All of the properties are required to comply with the ADA. The ADA generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the ADA and that it will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. If required changes involve a greater expenditure than the Company currently anticipates, the Company's ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected.
