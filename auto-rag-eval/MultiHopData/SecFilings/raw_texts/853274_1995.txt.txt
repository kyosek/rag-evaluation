ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
INTRODUCTION
The Registrant owns facilities which operate in two distinct segments of the senior housing market.
The Registrant owns fee title to Chandler Villas and is the managing general partner of the partnership which owns Bradford Square. At both properties, residents rent on a monthly basis and receive all meals, mail service, linens and laundry. The staff provides services and security on a 24-hour basis. In addition, certain services ("Assisted Living") are provided to residents in need of additional care such as bathing, grooming and assisting with the self administration of medication. Higher monthly rents are charged for such Assisted living services. Neither medical treatment nor facilities, however, are provided. Each project is designed to cater to the needs of the individuals who are ambulatory, in relative good health and without need of specialized or continuing medical attention.
The Registrant also owns a site in the City of Camarillo, California which is permitted for development of a 123 unit residential retirement facility, designed along the Bradford Square/Chandler Villa concept.
The Registrant also owns 100% of 3 senior apartment complexes, Pacific Villas in Pomona, California, Cedar Villas in Ontario, California, and Villa Azusa in Azusa, California. The investment in these properties reflects the General Partners' belief in the strength of the housing market for senior citizens who choose the independent apartment life style in a complex specially designed for their needs.
During 1993, the Registrant sold its general partner's interest in Heritage Pointe Claremont.
RESIDENTIAL RETIREMENT FACILITIES AND SITE
BRADFORD SQUARE, CALIFORNIA
ACQUISITION - CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND OBLIGATIONS
In December of 1990, the Registrant became the sole General Partner of ARVP III/Bradford Square, L.P., a California limited partnership ("ARVP III/Bradford Square"), of which Bradford Square Limited Partnership No. 1, a California Limited Partnership ("Bradford
Square Limited") is the sole limited partner. Pursuant to the Agreement, Bradford Square Limited contributed the existing facility ("Bradford Square"), to ARVP III/Bradford Square and, simultaneously, through escrow, the Registrant contributed approximately $450,000 cash and caused two loans, totaling $3,600,000, to be made to ARVP III/Bradford Square. One of the loans, for $2,800,000, was secured by the Project and guaranteed by the General Partners. The other, for $800,000, was unsecured. The unsecured loan was repaid in full from Gross Offering Proceeds on March 20, 1991, the remaining balance on the $2,800,000 loan was paid in full with proceeds generated from new debt obtained in December 1992. The beneficial owners of Bradford Square Limited Partnership No. 1 are not affiliated with the Registrant. The Managing General Partner of this partnership is Frederick P. Aquirre, Esq.
Under the Partnership Agreement, in any quarter in which revenue generated by Bradford Square is insufficient to cover cash operating costs and payments on any secured loans, the Registrant is obligated to advance to ARVP III/Bradford Square sufficient cash to cover the shortfall. Any such advance may, at the Registrant's discretion be recorded as either a capital contribution or a loan. On any capital contribution, Registrant will receive a preferred return equivalent to 9% on 125% of the Gross Offering Proceeds contributed and 50% of the balance of any Cash Flow after the preferred return is paid. On sale, refinance, or liquidation, ARVP III will receive a priority return equal to 125% of all capital contributed, and 50% of any remaining balance after this priority distribution is paid. As of March 1996, there had been no cash shortfall and, therefore, no contribution was required of the Registrant.
THE FACILITY
Bradford Square is located at 1180 N. Bradford Avenue, Placentia, California, in central Orange County, six blocks from the Placentia Civic Center and one mile from the Orange Freeway (57), a north-south artery linking the County seat, Santa Ana, to the foothill communities. The Artesia Freeway (91), connecting Los Angeles to the inland empire communities of Riverside and San Bernardino, is three miles to the south. The facility is a two story 55,000 square foot New England style main building situated on approximately 2.5 acres containing 92 living units and common areas with a separate pavilion to accommodate parties and other resident activities. Four different studio apartment configurations range in size from 388 to 405 square feet all with private patios or balconies. Common areas include a central dining room, living room, sitting room and sun parlors. A beauty/barber shop and a private dining room for residents to entertain family and friends are conveniently located on premises. The two and one half acre site includes shuffleboard courts, a resident maintained garden plot and a large park-like green with a walking path and conversation areas.
The average occupancy rates during 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, and 1991 were 92%, 96%, 93%, 88%, and 93%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $1,422, $1,387, $1,360, $1,347, and $1,356, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 84 of the 92 Units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 94%.
FINANCING
In December 1992 the partnership borrowed $2,500,000. The loan, secured by a first trust deed against Bradford Square, and guaranteed by the General Partners, bears interest at 5.25% in excess of the seven year treasury yield and all of the unpaid principal and interest is due on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 1995 the unpaid principal balance was approximately $2,443,000.
COMPETITION
Drawing on information gathered through surveying residents and their families, 60% or more of the residents residing in a given facility come from within a 10-mile radius, thus defining the primary market. Therefore, using a 10-mile range as the criteria, Market Area 1 is comprised of the following cities: Anaheim, Brea, Chino Hills, Diamond Bar, Fullerton, Garden Grove, La Habra, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, La Palma, Orange, Placentia, Pomona, Santa Ana and Tustin. The total population of this primary market is 1,265,052 with a population of people age 65 and over of 110,232 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications, California, 1996). The U.S. Census Bureau, in 1990, reported that 13% of the 65+ population constitutes the primary residential care market, equaling 14,330 seniors in Market Area 1.
Currently, there are 14 facilities in Market Area 1 offering services and features similar to Bradford Square. These facilities, including Bradford Square, have a combined total of 1,606 units, potentially housing approximately 1,927 seniors, or about 19% saturation of the target market. Drawing on resident and family survey data, the market may be expanded to 33% or less due to units rented by residents coming from the primary area. Market saturation is also increased by indirect competition from small board and care homes, minimum service senior apartments and residential facilities lacking assisted living services; such facilities are not included in the figures.
Currently, ARV Assisted Living operates four facilities in Market Area 1.
CHANDLER VILLAS, ARIZONA
ACQUISITION, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND OBLIGATIONS
This facility was purchased in September of 1990 for $3,400,000. The Seller was Superior Bank, FSB of Oak Brook Terrace, Illinois, which acquired the facility on foreclosure of a loan it had extended to the original developer. Registrant paid $900,000 in cash and obtained a $2,500,000 loan secured by the Project. Prior to December 31, 1991, the loan was paid in full.
THE FACILITY
The facility is located in the middle of the Valley of the Sun at 101 South Yucca Street, one block south of Chandler Boulevard, the main east west artery in Chandler, Arizona, 20 minutes from Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. Chandler Community Hospital is less than 1 mile away. Regional shopping malls are within a short drive of the facility and neighborhood shopping centers are close by. The surrounding neighborhood consists of a mix of commercial and single family homes and apartments.
Chandler Villas is located on an 8 acre site, and consists of 14 tile roofed buildings containing a total of 164 one and two bedroom apartment style units with up to 900 square feet of living space per unit. Common areas include a dining room, living room, library, beauty salon, and a recreation building with nearby pool, spa and shuffleboard court. Covered parking is provided.
The average occupancy rates during 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, and 1991 were 99%, 99%, 99%, 97%, and 88%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $716, $704, $688, $679, and $678, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 156 of the 164 Units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 95%.
FINANCING
In December, 1992 the Partnership borrowed $2,500,000. The loan, secured by a first trust deed against Chandler Villas and guaranteed by the General Partners, bears interest at 5.25% in excess of the seven year treasury yield and all unpaid principal and interest is due on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 1995, the unpaid principal balance was approximately $2,443,000.
COMPETITION
Based on market surveys that conclude that 60% or more of the residents residing in a given facility come from within a 10-mile radius, the primary market for Chandler Villas may be defined by the following cities: Apache Junction, Bapchule, Chandler, Guadalupe, Laveen, Maricopa, Mesa, Ocotillo, Scottsdale, Sun Lakes, and Tempe. The total population of this primary market is 712,812 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications, California, 1996). Assuming that at least 8% of the total population is 65 years of age or older, approximately 57,024 seniors are residing within a 10-mile radius of Chandler Villas. The U. S. Census Bureau, in 1990, reported that 13% of the 65+ population constitutes the primary residential care market, equaling 7,413 seniors in Market Area 2.
Currently, there are four facilities in Market Area 2 offering services and features similar to Chandler Villas. These facilities have a combined total of 615 units, potentially housing approximately 676 seniors, or about 9% saturation of the target market. The market may be expanded to 33% or less due to units rented by residents coming from the primary area. Market saturation is also increased by indirect competition from small board and care homes, minimum service senior apartments and residential facilities lacking assisted living services; such facilities are not included in the figures.
VILLA LAS POSAS, CALIFORNIA (SITE)
LOCATION
The 3.10 acre site is located in the City of Camarillo, County of Santa Barbara, California, on Las Posas Road, a major north-south artery approximately one mile north of State Highway 101, the major thoroughfare in the community. Camarillo, a city of approximately 47,000 residents, is 45 miles northwest of Los Angeles, 7 miles east of Oxnard (population approximately 125,000) and 7 miles west of Thousand Oaks (population approximately 101,000).
DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FEES; CONSTRUCTION FINANCING
The site was purchased from an unrelated seller for $1,210,000 and as of December 31, 1995 the Registrant had paid approximately $1,317,000 in engineering, architectural and other predevelopment costs.
Villa Las Posas will be a 3-story, Mediterranean style building containing 123 units. Forty percent (40%) of the 89,000 square feet of the assisted living project will be devoted to common areas consisting of amenities such as two living rooms with fireplaces, dining and laundry rooms, a Health Center, beauty salon, commercial kitchen, activities room, and a library. A central courtyard, landscaped gardens and meandering walkways will also be an integral part of the facility.
Construction of Villa Las Posas is expected to begin in May of 1996 with completion scheduled for May of 1997. Construction financing is currently in negotiation with a commercial lender.
COMPETITION
From their analysis of the general competitive conditions to which Villa Las Posas would be subject, the General Partners have determined that the relevant market area consists of Camarillo and Oxnard and adjacent communities of El Rio and Leesdale. The concentration of this population base is within 10 miles of the site, and easily accessible by major arteries. The secondary market area of Thousand Oaks-Newbury Park is also within this radius, but is considered less important to the success of the project because of its evolution as an extension of the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area and resulting identification with this larger market. The City of Ventura (population approximately 85,000) is 15 miles to the northwest and is a relatively self-contained market area, and has not been considered as a continuing source of residents.
Existing competition within the primary market area consists of two residential-congregate care retirement complexes which offer substantially similar amenities and/or services. The first, opened approximately 14 years ago, is a 107 unit complex located about 2 miles from the site, is licensed to distribute medication and places a greater emphasis on health services rather than on independent life-style and community activities. This facility offers similar tenant services in generally smaller living accommodations with less attractive common areas and grounds than planned for Villa Las Posas. The second, opened in the early 1970s, is a 122 unit facility in Oxnard approximately 9 miles from the site, also offering semi-private and private accommodations, services and pricing similar to those to be offered by Villa Los Posas. The location of this competitor coupled with the general condition of the building and grounds attract residents primarily on government assisted programs.
SENIOR APARTMENTS
GENERAL
FORMATION OF THREE (FORMER) PARTNERSHIPS
In January 1992, the Registrant entered the senior apartment market by acquiring a partnership interest in Heritage Pointe Claremont Partners, L.P., a California Limited Partnership ("HPCP"). Prior to the Registrant's admission, HPCP's Sole Partners were Urban Housing Systems, Inc., a California corporation, General Partner ("UHSI") and two individuals (Michael A. Costa and John M. Huskey) who owned 100% of UHSI's stock. As a result of the Registrant's admission, the Registrant and UHSI became Co-General Partners of HPCP with a 50% and 12.5% interest, respectively, and Messrs. Costa and Huskey became the two Limited Partners each having an 18.75% partnership interest. Development and entitlement work began thereafter and resulted in a completed project in 1993 as explained below (See ITEM 2, "PROMISSORY NOTES").
Later in 1992, the Registrant, UHSI and Messrs. Costa and Huskey formed 2 additional partnerships, each owning the same percentages as in HPCP. Each of these partnerships was created to acquire a senior apartment complex from an unrelated seller. One partnership (Heritage Pointe Pomona Partners, L.P. ["HPPP"]) purchased Pacific Villas, a 132 unit facility in Pomona, and the other partnership (Heritage Pointe Ontario Partners, L.P. ["HPOP"]) purchased Cedar Villas, a similar 137 unit facility in Ontario, California.
At the time of these three partnership formations and property acquisitions, neither UHSI nor Mr. Costa nor Mr. Huskey were affiliated with the Registrant. Subsequently, however, Mr. Costa became a director and vice president of Registrant's general partner, positions from which he resigned in the first quarter of 1994.
THE REGISTRANT'S BUY-OUT OF UHSI, COSTA & HUSKEY FROM EACH OF THE THREE PARTNERSHIPS
In May 1993, UHSI assigned its interest in HPCP, HPPP and HPOP to Costa and Huskey. As a result, their interests in these partnership increased from 18.75% to 25% each. The Registrant subsequently purchased all of Messrs. Costa's and Huskey's interests in each of HPCP, HPPP and HPOP for $198,000, cash plus, the purchase agreement obligated the Registrant's individual and corporate general partners to indemnify and hold the two limited partners and UHSI harmless. As part of the transaction the general partners received $96,000 for providing the indemnification. After this transaction, neither UHSI nor Mr. Costa nor Mr. Huskey were affiliated with the Registrant or its General Partners.
The Registrant now owns 100% of Pacific Villas and Cedar Villas, and has sold Heritage Pointe Claremont, all as described below. In addition, in 1993, independent of UHSI and Messrs. Costa and Huskey, the Registrant purchased an additional facility, Villa Azusa, which it now owns and operates.
The 3 senior apartments which the Registrant operates are described below.
PACIFIC VILLAS
TERMS OF PURCHASE
The Partnership which the Registrant formed to purchase Pacific Villas and which was subsequently liquidated on the Registrant's purchase of all of other partnership interests, as described above, is referred to below as HPPP.
Pacific Villas was purchased for $5,621,000 in August 1992, from a non-related entity which had owned and operated it from 1987. $525,000 of the purchase price was paid in cash. HPPP paid a real estate commission of $150,000 to UHSI. At the close of escrow HPPP took Pacific Villas subject to, but did not assume, a loan in favor of Fidelity Federal Bank. The loan is evidenced by a note due on November 1, 2017 and requires monthly payments of principal and interest designed to fully amortize it as of the due date. The balance of the purchase price was funded through the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately $75,000. The interest rate is adjusted monthly by adding a rate differential of 2.25% to the most recent available monthly weighted average cost of funds by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to its 11th District members. At December 31, 1995, this loan had an unpaid principal balance of approximately $4,314,900. The monthly payment is approximately $30,000, of which approximately $5,200 is being credited to principal. The loan is evidenced by a note and the note is secured by a first deed of trust. The note and the deed of trust contain due-on-sale and due-on-encumbrance clauses which permit the lender to accelerate the loan's maturity date if the borrower, without the lender's prior written consent, sells, encumbers, or otherwise transfers an interest in the property. HPPP did not assume the loan and did not pay an assumption fee. Rather, it relied on the lender's August 19, 1992 certificate of outstanding indebtedness.
The balance of the purchase price was evidenced by a one year, $424,939 note in favor of the seller. Interest only at 8% per annum, was payable in monthly installments of $2,833 and this note was paid in full on August 25, 1993.
THE FACILITY
Pacific Villas consists of 132 units, 115 one bedroom, one bath, and kitchen and 17 two bedroom, one bath and kitchen apartments spread out among 4.7 landscaped acres. This gate guarded community also features an intercom system connecting each apartment with the gate, a pool and spa, park benches along the walkways and a satellite dish which makes broad T.V. coverage available to all residents. The complex was built in 1986 and has been well maintained.
LOCATION
Pacific Villas is located at 3642 North Garey Avenue, in the northwest residential section of Pomona. This area has a unique college-town atmosphere as several prestigious universities are located in Pomona and in the immediate bordering towns of Claremont and La Verne.
More generically, the facility lies in the northeast section of Los Angeles County, near the border with San Bernardino County, and although its neighborhood is essentially residential, it is less than a block away from Foothill Boulevard, a major thoroughfare. In addition, it is readily accessible to the San Bernardino Freeway (10), the Foothill Freeway (210), the Pomona Freeway (60), the Orange Freeway (57), and the Corona Expressway (71). The property is located approximately 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, five miles from Ontario, 20 miles from San Bernardino, and 25 miles from Pasadena/Glendale.
Pomona, a city of approximately 140,000 residents, and its neighboring towns in the San Gabriel Valley may be described as "bedroom" communities with relatively high light industrial development and predominantly middle-income demographics. The property is situated in an area that is less developed than other sections of Pomona. While conveniences such as public transportation, shopping and restaurants are within walking distance of the facility, the neighborhood also features wooded areas and low density zoning.
MARKETING AND RENTAL DATA
The project's primary market is Pomona and the neighboring residential communities of Claremont, Montclair, Upland, Chino, Fontana, Ontario and La Verne. There is a combined population of approximately 500,000 all within a 10 mile radius of Pacific Villas. The General Partners' experience with the 8 facilities they own and/or operate within a 30 mile radius of this project and their study of this market area demonstrates favorable demographics and population trends necessary to sustain current high occupancy rates.
The average occupancy rates during 1995 and 1994 were 90% and 95%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $560 and $547, respectively. This data is unavailable for the years 1992 and 1993. At March 17, 1996, 119 of the 132 apartments were rented for an occupancy rate of 90%. All rental agreements are an annual lease with an option to renew on a month-to-month basis at lease expiration.
COMPETITION
Existing competition within the primary market area consists of 10 senior apartments with a total capacity of 1,316 units. Sizes range from 65 to 186 units with average prices of $0.68 to $1.23 per square foot for larger units. Pacific Villas units now rent from $0.87 to $0.89 per square foot. The two-bedroom units currently rent for less per square foot than the one-bedrooms.
There are no facilities in Pomona that are directly competitive with Pacific Villas. All similar projects in neighboring communities were built between 1983 and 1992 . The vacancy range for all senior citizen oriented apartment projects in the market area is 0-10%.
Pacific Villas features 600 square foot 1 bedroom apartments and 767 square foot 2 bedroom apartments. Concerning possible new entries into this Market, even though obtaining construction financing is problematic in the current economic climate, low vacancy rates have traditionally attracted direct competition.
CEDAR VILLAS
TERMS OF PURCHASE
The Partnership which the Registrant formed to purchase Cedar Villas and which was subsequently liquidated on the Registrant's purchase of all of other partnership interests, as described above, is referred to below as HPOP.
Cedar Villas was purchased on October 1, 1992 for $4,655,000 from a non-related entity which had owned and operated it from 1986. $553,000 of the purchase price was paid in cash, and approximately $4,112,000 was taken by the Project subject to, but not assuming, a loan in favor of Standard Federal Savings Bank. The loan is evidenced by a note due February 1, 1999 and requires monthly payments of principal and interest designed to fully amortize it as of the due date. The loan is evidenced by a note and the note is secured by a first deed of trust against the Project. The interest rate is adjusted monthly by adding a rate differential of 2.25% to the most recent available monthly weighted average cost of funds by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to its 11th District members. At December 31, 1995, the loan had an unpaid balance of approximately $3,932,000. The monthly payment is approximately $31,000 of which approximately $4,875 is being credited to principal. The note and the deed of trust contain due-on-sale and due-on-encumbrance clauses which permit the lender to accelerate the loan's maturity date if the borrower, without the lender's prior written consent, sells, encumbers, or otherwise transfers an interest in the property. HPOP did not assume the loan and did not pay an assumption fee, rather it relied on the lender's September 30, 1992 certificate of outstanding indebtedness.
THE FACILITY
Cedar Villas is a 137 unit senior apartment complex designed for active and semi-active persons aged 57 and older. Built in 1983, the complex covers 3.4 acres and includes 104 one bedroom and 33 two bedroom units containing 460 and 677 square feet respectively.
All apartments feature garbage disposals, an all electric kitchen, frost free refrigerators, solar hot water, smoke detectors, fire sprinklers, walk in closets and air conditioning. Carpeting and drapes/mini-blinds are also included. Laundry facilities are located in the clubhouse. Approximately 50% of the total facility is landscaped open space, on which is located a 2040 square foot central recreation building and rental office. The central courtyard is equipped for horseshoes, barbecues and patio parties. There are 107 parking spaces, approximately half of them covered.
LOCATION
Cedar Villas is located at 301 E. Cedar Street, in the western residential section of Ontario bordered by Montclair and Pomona to the west, Rancho Cucamonga and Upland to the north, and Chino and Fontana, south and east respectively. The facility lies in the southwest section of San Bernardino County, and although its neighborhood is essentially residential, it is less than a mile away from the Pomona Freeway the major artery connecting downtown Los Angeles, 40 miles to the west and San Bernardino, 20 miles to the east.
Ontario, a city of approximately 153,000 residents, and its neighboring towns in the Inland Empire may be described as "bedroom" communities with relatively high light industrial development and predominantly middle-income demographics. The Ontario International Airport causes the city to become the core of the market area of surrounding communities.
MARKET DATA
The project's primary market is Ontario and the neighboring residential communities of Claremont, Montclair, Upland, Chino, Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga. There is a combined population of approximately 650,000 all within a 10 mile radius of Cedar Villas. The General Partners' experience with the 8 facilities they now own and/or operate within a 30 mile radius of this project and their study of this market area demonstrates favorable demographics and population trends necessary to sustain current high occupancy rates.
The average occupancy rates during 1995 and 1994 were 93% and 93%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $448 and $443, respectively. This data is unavailable for the years 1992 and 1993. At March 17, 1996, 127 of the 137 apartments were rented for an occupancy rate of 93%. All rental agreements are on an annual lease with an option to renew on a month-to-month basis at lease expiration.
COMPETITION
Existing competition within the primary market area consists of 9 senior apartments with a total capacity of 1,390 units. Sizes range from 60 to 232 units with average prices of $0.72 to $1.23 per square foot for larger units. Cedar Villas units now rent from $0.72 to $0.83 per square foot.
There are three comparable senior apartment complexes in Ontario, all built between 1984 and 1986, ranging in size from 60 to 101 units. Apartment sizes, pricing and amenities are similar to Cedar Villas.
The remaining facilities, Sunnyside II and Sunnyside III, are smaller complexes with smaller unit sizes and slightly higher pricing per square foot than Cedar Villas. Their ongoing vacancy rates are approximately the same as Cedar Villas.
Projects in the remainder of the primary market show vacancy rates from 2% to 10.4% according to a rental survey conducted in January, 1995.
VILLA AZUSA
On May 26, 1993, the Registrant purchased from an independent third party, its third self contained senior apartment complex.
TERMS OF PURCHASE
Villa Azusa was purchased for $4,550,000, $1,295,000 of which was paid in cash, and the Registrant took the property subject to existing bank financing in favor of Fidelity Federal Bank for approximately $3,229,000. The balance of the purchase price was funded through the assumption of other liabilities totaling approximately $26,000. The loan is evidenced by a note due February 1, 2017 and requires monthly payments of principal and interest designed to fully amortize it as of the due date. The interest rate is adjusted monthly by adding a rate differential of 2.25% above the monthly eleventh district cost of funds. The note and deed of trust contain due on sale clauses.
The bank has accepted monthly payments from June 1992 onward and has not exercised any rights under the due on sale clauses which state the bank may declare the unpaid balance immediately due and payable should the property be sold. At December 31, 1995, the note had an unpaid balance of approximately $3,067,000. The monthly payment is approximately $22,000 of which approximately $5,050 is being credited to principal.
THE FACILITY
Villa Azusa is a 147 unit, one bedroom, gated senior apartment complex. The facility was built in 1979 and has undergone renovations, which were completed in the Spring of 1994. All apartments feature carpeting and drapes, garbage disposal, an all electric kitchen, electric hot water, smoke detectors, walk-in closets and air conditioning. The recreation center offers the convenience of laundry facilities and the luxury of a therapeutic spa. The facility covers 3.44 acres, of which 50% is landscaped.
LOCATION
The address is 200 E. Gladstone Street, in the southeast residential section of Azusa bordered by single family and commercial retail development, in the northeast section of Los Angeles County, less than a mile away from the 210 Freeway and 5 miles from the 10 Freeway, the main artery connecting it to downtown Los Angeles.
MARKET DATA
Azusa, a city of approximately 43,300 residents and its neighboring cities of Covina, West Covina, San Dimas, Glendora, Duarte, Monrovia, Baldwin Park and Irwindale, represents a 12 mile radius rental market area. The General Partners' experience with the 8 facilities they now own and/or operate within a 30 mile radius of this project and their study of this market area demonstrates favorable demographics and population trends necessary to sustain current high occupancy rates.
The average occupancy rates during 1995 and 1994 were 82% and 84%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $477 and $465, respectively. This data is unavailable for the years 1992 and 1993. At March 17, 1996, 139 of the 147 apartments were rented for an occupancy rate of 95%. All rental agreements are on an annual lease with an option to renew on a month-to-month basis at lease expiration.
COMPETITION
Existing competition within the primary market area consists of 5 senior apartments with a total capacity of 675 units. Sizes range from 60 to 168 units with average prices of $0.83 to $1.09 per square foot. Villa Azusa units now rent from $0.89 to $1.10 per square foot. Projects in the remainder of the primary market show vacancy rates from 0% to 20.0%.
PROMISSORY NOTES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF HERITAGE POINTE CLAREMONT
HERITAGE POINT CLAREMONT PARTNERS, L.P. ("HPCP")
Effective January 14, 1992, the Registrant became a 50% co-general partner with UHSI which owned a 12.5% interest, and Messrs. Costa and Huskey, each of whom owned 18.5% of the Partnership as limited partners. The partners contributed cash and all of their rights in several contracts to purchase, finance and develop a senior apartment complex in Claremont, California. Among the operating contracts was a Disposition and Development Agreement with the City of Claremont and its Redevelopment Agency, pursuant to which HPCP proceeded to develop plans for the project. Early in 1993, as explained above, Messrs. Costa and Huskey sold and assigned their entire interests and that of UHSI which they had previously acquired to the Registrant.
ACQUISITION
HPCP purchased an undeveloped portion of land in Claremont, California from the Claremont Redevelopment Agency for $1,300,000 on October 5, 1992, and obtained a construction loan agreement from a commercial lender in 1992 for $5,600,000. With the loan proceeds, HPCP built a 154 unit senior apartment complex with final construction completed in November, 1993. HPCP received its certificate of occupancy in November of 1993 and opened in December of 1993.

On May 31, 1993, Michael Costa and John Husky sold their partnership interests in HPCP to the Registrant (See above in this ITEM 2 "SENIOR APARTMENTS, GENERAL.") Then, in September 1993, the Registrant contracted to sell the project to Claremont Senior Partners ("CSP") for $12,281,900. The managing general partner of the Registrant (ARVAL) is the Special Limited Partner of CSP. The transaction closed on December 30, 1993. CSP assumed the balance of the construction loan of $4,852,216 (although the Registrant remained fully liable for the loan) and the Registrant had taken back two notes receivable to finance the sale.
In September 1994, CSP obtained permanent financing, the proceeds of which were primarily utilized to pay off the existing balance on the construction loan, and a portion of the existing balance on the construction loan, and a portion of the existing principal and interest on the Partnership's related promissory notes. As a result, both promissory notes were amended and the combined balance due was reduced to $6,076,110 (eliminating the portion related to the construction loan). The notes bear interest at 8% and the outstanding balance and interest are payable from excess cash flows as defined in the CSP partnership agreement. Additionally, these notes continue to be secured by certain CSP partners' interests in CSP and are due January 25, 2010.
In January 1995, CSP paid $1,145,000 to the Partnership as principal and interest reductions of the promissory notes. This transaction has not been treated as a completed sale for accounting purposes under the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board 66; however, the sale is considered consummated. Accordingly, the property is reported as property under contract for sale, the buyer's down payment and payments on the promissory notes are reflected as deposits under contract for sale and the promissory notes are not recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
