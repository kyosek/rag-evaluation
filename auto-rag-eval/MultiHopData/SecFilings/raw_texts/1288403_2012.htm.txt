Item 2. Properties
Our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico, Alabama and Texas. The offshore fields are found in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 4,900 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically results in high production rates. The reservoirs in our onshore fields are generally characterized as having low porosity and permeability and require stimulation and artificial lift to produce. The following describes our 10 largest fields as of December 31, 2012, based on quantities of proved reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis. At December 31, 2012, these fields accounted for approximately 82% of our proved reserves.
(1) Thousand cubic feet equivalent - Mcfe. The amount was determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.
Our Fields
On December 31, 2012 we had two fields of major significance (having proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis). The Spraberry field (Yellow Rose Properties) is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Ship Shoal 349 field is located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Below is a description of these fields.
Spraberry Field (Yellow Rose Properties).
The Spraberry field is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. W&T acquired a 100% working interest in approximately 21,900 net acres in connection with the acquisition of the Yellow Rose Properties in May 2011 and acquired approximately 9,500 net acres earlier in 2011. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1935 and extends over several counties in West Texas comprising about 1.6 million acres. The field is 150 miles long and 75 miles wide, and it has undergone much change and expansion over the years, both aerially and vertically. The correlative interval is now over 3,500 feet thick and includes the Clearfork, Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Dean, and Wolfcamp formations. These formations are correlative over the area but are lenticular in nature and vary in thickness, porosity, and permeability even over short distances. The general completion technique includes hydraulic fracturing and installation of sucker rod pumps. During 2012, W&T drilled 64 additional wells, which included one horizontal well. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 2.8 MMBoe (17.1 Bcfe) from our wells. In 2013, W&T plans to drill 20 vertical wells and seven horizontal wells. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in the Spraberry field were 31.6 MMBoe (189.8 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012 and 28.1 MMBoe (168.5 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from the Spraberry field for the year 2012 and from the acquisition date of May 11, 2011 to December 31, 2011.
(1) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs.
Volume measurements:
Boe - barrel of oil equivalent
Mcf - thousand cubic feet
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany).
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 31.2 MMBoe gross (187.0 Bcfe gross). This field is a sub-salt development with five productive horizons below salt at depths up to 17,000 feet. As of December 31, 2012, 25 wells have been drilled, 16 of which have been successful. In 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan. As a result, in 2011, we drilled one development well and one exploration well. In 2012, a third well was drilled and completed as part of an ongoing drilling program and two additional wells were sidetracked. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 22.7 MMBoe (136.3 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012 and 20.3 MMBoe (121.7 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years.

The following is a description of the remainder of our top 10 properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2012, five of which are located on the conventional shelf and three are located in the deepwater. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of our total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Viosca Knoll 783 Field. (Viosca Knoll 783 Lease (Tahoe) and Viosca Knoll 784 Lease (SE Tahoe)) The Viosca Knoll 783 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 140 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,500 to 1,700 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll blocks 783 and 784, with subsea tiebacks to two platforms in Main Pass 252. Shell discovered the Tahoe prospect in 1984 and the SE Tahoe prospect in 1996. We acquired a 70% working interest in the Tahoe lease and a 100% working interest in the SE Tahoe lease from Shell in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 31.2 MMBoe gross (187.0 Bcfe gross). The Tahoe prospect is a supra-salt (above the salt layer) development with two productive horizons at depths ranging to 10,300 feet. The SE Tahoe prospect is also a supra-salt development with one productive horizon at a depth of 9,325 feet. As of December 31, 2012, 16 wells have been drilled at the Tahoe prospect, eight of which have been successful and one successful well has been drilled at the SE Tahoe prospect. During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 336 Bbls of oil per day, 1,505 Bbls of NGLs per day and 26,240 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 6,215 Boe per day (37,288 Mcfe per day).

Fairway is comprised of Mobile Bay Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) and located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship in the Fairway field, from Shell in August 2011. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2012, six wells have been drilled, one of which was a replacement well. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 112.5 MMBoe gross (674.9 Bcfe gross). This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 17 Bbls of oil per day, 1,495 Bbls of NGLs per day and 20,779 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 4,975 Boe per day (29,848 Mcfe per day).
Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation (“Kerr-McGee”). The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2012, 43 wells have been drilled in this field, 35 of which were successful. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 41.9 MMBoe gross (251.6 Bcfe gross). One new well reached target depth in 2011 and began production in 2012. In addition, one workover was performed in 2012. During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 329 Bbls of oil per day, 437 Bbls of NGLs per day and 15,246 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 3,306 Boe per day (19,838 Mcfe per day).

High Island 22 Field. High Island 22 field consists of High Island blocks 21 and 22. The field is located approximately 10 miles off the Texas coastline in 36 feet of water. Two platforms, the “A” and the “B”, are located on block 22. We acquired a 100% working interest in the field from Kerr-McGee in 2006. The field produces from two major sands, the LH 20 and LH 24. The productive sands are Lower Miocene, Lent Hanseni in age. As of December 31, 2012, 12 wells have been drilled, eight of which have been successful. A recent field study resulted in certain reserves being classified as proved as of December 31, 2012, compared to reserves being classified as unproved in 2011. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 30.0 MMBoe gross (179.9 Bcfe gross). During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged one Bbl of oil per day, one Bbl of NGLs per day and 95 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 18 Boe per day (109 Mcfe per day).
Main Pass 98 Field. Main Pass 98 field consists of Main Pass blocks 98 and 180. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 55 miles east of Venice in 91 feet of water. We acquired our 100% working interest in these blocks from NCX Co LLC in 2009. The field produces from low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands located between two merging, generally south dipping faults. The productive interval is Middle Miocene Bigenerina Humblei. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 4.1 MMBoe gross (24.7 Bcfe gross). As of December 31, 2012, 11 wells have been drilled, seven of which have been successful. In 2012, no wells were drilled or recompleted and three workovers were performed. During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 106 Bbls of oil per day, 70 Bbls of NGLs per day and 2,171 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 537 Boe per day (3,225 Mcfe per day).
East Cameron 321 Field. East Cameron 321 field is located approximately 97 miles off the Louisiana coastline in 225 feet of water. Two production facilities, the “A” and “B” platforms, are located on the block. This field has multiple sands that are productive in faulted, structural traps. These sands are Pleistocene Ang B in age. As of December 31, 2012, 75 wells have been drilled, 57 of which have been successful. Cumulative field production through 2012 is approximately 93.6 MMBoe gross (561.7 Bcfe gross). We own a 100% working interest in the field and are the operator. During December 2012, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 1,279 Bbls of oil per day and 266 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1,324 Boe per day (7,942 Mcfe per day).
Proved Reserves
Our estimated proved reserves totaled 117.5 MMBoe (705.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012. The mix by product was 47% oil, 13% NGLs and 40% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below. Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant.
Our proved reserves are summarized below. These reserve amounts are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies.
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
(1) In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2012 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2012. Prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials. For oil, the West Texas Intermediate posted price was used in the calculation and, after adjustments, a price of $98.13 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the oil price using SEC guidance. The NGLs price of $47.30 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was used in the calculation and the adjusted price of $2.77 per Mcf was used in computing the amounts above. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production, development costs and ARO are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3) We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves increased to 117.5 MMBoe (705.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012 from 116.9 MMBoe (701.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of extensions and discoveries of 15.7 MMBoe (94.5 Bcfe) due to our participation in the drilling of 25 successful exploratory wells (gross) and increases resulting from well completions and recompletions. The extensions and discoveries were primarily in the Yellow Rose Properties (11.6 MMBoe /69.5 Bcfe), the High Island 22 field (2.7 MMBoe/16.2 Bcfe) and the West Cameron 71 field (1.0 MMBoe/6.1 Bcfe). For the Yellow Rose Properties, the increase to proved reserves was due to 11 exploration wells being completed. In addition, there was a redetermination of reserves related to successful horizontal drilling and drilling using 40 acre spacing in certain areas. For the High Island 22 field, the increase in proved reserves was due to a recent field study that demonstrated that additional reserves could be recovered by drilling a replacement for a well that experienced a mechanical failure. The increase at the West Cameron 71 field was due to a successful exploration well. Estimated proved reserves also increased from the acquisition of Newfield Properties discussed in Item 1, Business, which added 7.0 MMBoe (42.0 Bcfe). Reserves decreased from revisions of previous estimates by 4.6 MMBoe (27.5 Bcfe) and by 0.4 MMBoe (2.2 Bcfe) from the sale of one field. Decreases due to production were 17.1 MMBoe (102.8 Bcfe). See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2012. See Financial Statements - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2012 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 24 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 28 years. He has over 35 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 21 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any
significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Reservoir Engineering Manager has served in that capacity since 2006, after having served as a Staff Reservoir Engineer since joining the Company in 2004. Prior to joining the Company, he served as a Reservoir Engineer at Shell, then VP of Reservoir Engineering at Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and later as Manager Acquisitions Engineering at Matrix Oil & Gas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from Iowa State University in 1972.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert Bbl to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2012 were estimated at $583.6 million.
Our PUDs by field as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
The following table presents a reconciliation of our PUDs for 2012:
Volume measurements:
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet equivalent
During 2012, we drilled numerous development wells that converted PUDs to proved developed reserves (“PDs”) and spent $263.6 million on development of PUDs during 2012. Activity in 2012 allowed conversion of approximately 50% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2011 to proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2012. At our Ship Shoal 349/359 (Mahogany) field, we completed two wells, (SS 359 A5 ST and SS 359 A13). As of December 31, 2012, we were in the process of completing the SS 359 A9 ST well, which moved additional reserves from PUDs to PDs. In 2013, we plan to drill the SS 359 A14 well and A15 well. This drilling program has resulted in the reclassification of a substantial portion of the PUDs to PDs in the Mahogany field. The PUDs at our Mississippi Canyon 243 field and Viosca Knoll 823 fields were obtained through acquisitions in 2010. We completed one well at Mississippi Canyon 243 (MC 243 A4 ST) in 2012 and are currently drilling another development well (MC 243 A2 ST BP1). Development of the Mississippi Canyon 243 field and Viosca Knoll 823 field is expected to continue into 2014.
In May 2011, we acquired the Yellow Rose Properties, which contributed to a significant increase in PUDs in 2011. In this field, we completed 27 development wells and nine exploration wells from the acquisition date of May 11, 2011 to December 31, 2011. In 2012, we completed 53 development wells and 11 exploration wells. One of the wells completed was a horizontal well and two other horizontal wells reached target depth in 2012, which proved the concept and allowed additional horizontal PUD locations to be booked. Additionally, wells completed in 2011 and 2012 proved that the concept of down spacing to 40-acres was viable in a portion of the field, allowing the conversion of certain unproven locations to PUDs in 2012. In 2013, we expect to drill approximately 26 development wells and one exploration well, comprised of seven horizontal wells and 20 vertical wells. See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements - Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the Yellow Rose Properties.
In the High Island 22 field, a recent field study demonstrated that additional reserves could be recovered by drilling a replacement for a well that experienced a mechanical failure. This allowed unproved reserves in 2011 to be reclassified as proved reserves as of December 31, 2012.
We believe that we will be able to develop all of the reserves classified as PUDs at December 31, 2012 within five years from the date such reserves were recorded. Our capital budget for 2013 is up 6% from our 2012 capital budget, with 37% dedicated to development activities, split 43% offshore and 57% onshore. The capital allocated to our development activities will assist us in converting the PUDs to proved developed reserves.
Acreage
The following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2012. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 54% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 11% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, 48,689 net acres of the total 364,543 net undeveloped offshore acres (13%) could expire in 2013, 95,393 net acres (26%) could expire in 2014, 57,166 net acres (16%) could expire in 2015, 31,968 net acres (9%) could expire in 2016, and 131,327 net acres (36%) could expire in 2017 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, our rights to approximately 148,318 net acres of the total 163,824 net undeveloped onshore acres (91%) could expire in 2013, 5,463 net acres (3%) could expire in 2014, 10,038 net acres (6%) could expire in 2015, and five net acres could expire thereafter. Of the undeveloped onshore leasehold, there are 138,235 net acres that can be extended by drilling two additional wells in 2013 and further extended by additional operations or production in future years. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2013, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net offshore acreage increased 273,645 net acres (53%) from December 31, 2011 and our net onshore acreage increased 10,930 net acres (6%) from December 31, 2011. The increase in our net offshore acreage was primarily attributable to the Newfield Properties acquisition and offshore property interests acquired through purchase from the government. This increase was partially offset due to certain offshore leases that terminated and the sale of our interest at South Timbalier 41. The increase in our net onshore acreage is primarily attributable to additional leasehold interests acquired in Texas.
Production
For the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, our net daily production averaged 280.9 MMcfe, 278.2 MMcfe and 238.4 MMcfe, respectively. Production increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2011 and increases in the Ship Shoal 349 field attributable to development activities, partially offset by decreases related to storms, pipeline shutdowns and natural reservoir declines. Production increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010 and the resumption of operations in certain fields that had been shut down from June 2010 to March 2011 due to pipeline outages.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three fiscal years.
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Refer to the descriptions of our 10 largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose Properties) and Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) over the past three fiscal years, each of which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 of this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2012 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest.
Offshore Wells
Onshore Wells
All Productive Wells
(1) Includes seven gross (5.0 net) oil wells and eight gross (4.9 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity increased in 2012 compared to 2011, and also increased in 2011 compared to 2010. Our onshore drilling activity increased after our acquisition of the Yellow Rose Properties in May 2011 and additional leasehold interests acquired in both West and East Texas.
The tables below are based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine productive wells drilled.
Development Drilling
The following table sets forth information relating to our development wells drilled over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross development wells drilled during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 100% each year.
Exploration Drilling
The following table sets forth information relating to our exploration drilling over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross exploration wells drilled during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 96%, 94% and 63%, respectively.
Recent Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth 2013 drilling activity to February 15, 2013.
As of February 15, 2013, we were in the process of drilling and/or completing on a gross well basis one offshore development well, three offshore exploration wells, nine onshore exploration wells and two onshore development wells.
Capital Expenditures
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. For 2012, our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and equipment of $684.9 million included $205.6 million for acquisitions, $137.1 million for exploration activities, $310.2 million for development activities and $32.0 million for seismic, capitalized interest and other leasehold costs.
