As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company's Common Stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol "INBG.OB." The market for the Company's Common Stock is limited, volatile and sporadic and the price of the Company's Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results, news announcements, trading volume, sales of Common Stock by officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Company, general market trends, changes in the supply and demand for the Company's shares, and other factors. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for each quarter relating to the Company's Common Stock for the last two fiscal years.

Our common stock is considered a "penny stock." The application of the "penny stock" rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. The Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093 dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.

GENERAL
Prior to December 1, 2004, the Company was known as Ten Stix, Inc. and changed its name to MotorSports Emporium, Inc. on December 1, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada to engage in the motor sports industry targeting enthusiasts participating in die cast collecting, automobile restoration, purchase of high-performance accessories, motor sports related collectibles, driver's apparel, race venues and product licensing. On July 12, 2007, the Company reported in a Definitive Schedule 14C that the Company was going to change its name to International Building Technologies Group, Inc. to better reflect its change of business from motor sports related to building and construction of lightweight panels. On July 17, 2007 the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to International Building Technologies Group, Inc. effective on August 6, 2007. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7, "Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises," the Company has reentered the development stage. The Company devotes most of its efforts to establishing a new business, raising capital, establishing sources of supply, acquiring property, plant, equipment, and other operating assets. The Company's shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "INBG.OB."
Our principal executive offices are located at 17800 Castleton Street, Suite 638, City of Industry, CA 91748. Our telephone number is (626) 581-8500 and our facsimile number is (626) 626-7603. More information regarding our products and the Company is available on our website at www.ibtgi.com.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
The Company is in the business of manufacturing, marketing and providing equipment and materials to the building and construction industries. The Company is dedicated to providing unique and sustainable construction methods that can be used in developing and developed countries around the world.
The Company is a developer and provider of a superior panel based building technology. Our panel technology is superior to many traditional building methods, offers greater strength and resistance to winds and hurricanes, as well as providing a sustainable building solution that does not utilize timber, provides high insulation values and is resistant to bugs, mold and rot.
Our panel technology allows for the rapid, cost effective construction of residential, commercial, and high-rise buildings utilizing materials that are superior in strength and appearance, economical and eco-friendly. The Company provides customers with architectural design, panel supply, installation supervision, engineering, training and technical support.
Drawing on decades of experience in the construction industry in China and other countries in the Far East, the Company is seeking to develop new business in China, as well as establish a manufacturing facility for its equipment and materials. We plan to manufacture equipment for our own projects, as well as exporting equipment and materials to customers throughout the world.
The Company has also been working with investors to establish a Company operated panel production factory in China's Sichuan Province. This plan has been received with great interest by the Sichuan Construction Bureau, the government authority in governing major construction projects in rebuilding the earthquake region in Sichuan Province.
MATERIAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
RE-ENTERING DEVELOPMENT STAGE
On April 1, 2007, the Company re-entered the development stage. The Company has changed the focus of its business to building and constructing lightweight panels. The Company has devoted most of its efforts to establishing this new business, raising capital, establishing sources of supply, acquiring property, plant, equipment, and other operating assets.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008
The results of operations in the prior year are not indicative of the performance in neither the current period nor future periods. This is due to the change in business from an exclusive die cast merchandising business to developing and manufacturing lightweight panel technology.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, Operating Expenses for current operations totaled $480,513 is less than year ended December 31, 2008's Operating Expenses of $1,904,781. The decrease of $1,424,268 in Operating Expenses between years ended 2009 and 2008 is mostly attributed to the impairment of goodwill of $1,303,277 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no such impairment of goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2009.
The most significant change in our results of operations is the change in fair value of derivative. As of December 31, 2009, change in fair value of derivative gain was $32,133. There was no such gain in 2008. There was expense in change in fair value of derivative liability of $2,137,962 instead. The expense in 2008 was high because there was no such derivative liability at December 31, 2007. The Company incurred such expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 when the derivative liability was recognized at year end. The change in the fair value of derivative is resulted from the common stock equivalents of the Company on all convertible debentures and preferred stock exceeded the total common stock available for issuance by approximately by 54,520,869,200 shares. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth Yeung, holds 2,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are convertible into 43,956,043,956 common shares of the Company. Unless and until there is enough authorized common stock available to cover all common stock equivalents, Mr. Yeung will not convert any of his preferred shares. Furthermore, the stock is only convertible upon management's discretion. Management currently does not intend on converting such stock. Also, warrant options are not included in common stock equivalents since the exercise price of $0.25 for the warrant exceeds the fair value of common stock of $0.0002 per share on December 31, 2009. The remaining common stock equivalent of 10,564,825,244 shares has been accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of the derivative of $2,105,829 was determined by utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Another significant change in our results of operations is interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, Interest Expense for current operations totaled $1,402,005 is greater than the year ended December 31, 2008's Interest Expense of $705,535. The increase of $696,470 in Interest Expense is largely due to the amendment of the conversion feature of the notes in 2009. Accordingly, the beneficial conversion features of certain convertible notes were remeasured and were all amortized by the end of December 31, 2009. This consisted of non-cash interest expenses such as accretion of warrants and accretion on debt discounts (See Note 6 - Notes Payable & Debt Discounts). These non-cash expenses make up the majority of the difference between current year and prior year interest expense.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our future success and viability is primarily dependent upon our ability to increase operating cash flows and develop new business opportunities.
During the next 12 months, the Company's foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with reviewing or investigating any potential business ventures.
Additionally, we may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. In the year ended December 31, 2009 we relied on funds from the sale of shares of stock and loans from our shareholders to finance our operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of our stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to do so could have a material and adverse affect upon us and our shareholders.

The decrease of $276,736 during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009 were primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and decrease in net loss.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash flows used in investing activities was $80,750 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $161,500 during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash inflows in 2009 were the return of investment deposit from Wuhan Wufeng Machinery Company. Cash outflows in 2008 were related to the acquisition of Wuhan Wufeng Machinery Company.
For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $123,501 compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $599,852 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2008. Cash inflows in 2009 consisted of the sale of preferred stock. Cash inflows in 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and notes payable.
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operations.
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has generated no revenues from operations since it entered the development stage on April 1, 2007. Therefore, the Company's auditors have expressed substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that it can maintain its status as a going concern based on its ability to raise funds pursuant to future public and private offerings and to obtain advances and minimize operating expenses by not duplicating or incurring needless expenses.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Kenneth Yeung, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2009 that our disclosure controls and procedures have been improved and were maintained effectively at the reasonable assurance level in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed immediately below.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company's internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permits us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES AND SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified the following internal control deficiency which we had assessed as a material weakness as of Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008 during its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as follows:
1. We did not have adequate segregation of duties over certain areas of our financial reporting process.
The internal control deficiency identified above will only be completely corrected if the company expands and has the capacity to adequately segregate the duties to mitigate risk in financial reporting. Expansion will depend mostly on the ability of management to begin operations and generate enough income to warrant growth in personnel.
We did not have effective comprehensive entity-level internal controls specific to the structure of our board of directors and organization of critical committees. Due to our expected expansion, as disclosed in this Form 10-K, without correcting this significant deficiency and ensuring that our board of directors has the proper oversight and committees are properly established, the control environment in subsequent years may not be effective.
We had engaged a regionally-recognized independent consulting firm assisted management with its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including scope determination, planning, staffing, documentation, testing, remediation and retesting and overall program management of the assessment project. In conclusion, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer surmised that the Company has improved the effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.
MANAGEMENT'S REMEDIATION INITIATIVES
We are in the further process of evaluating our material and significant deficiencies. We have already begun to remediate many of the deficiencies. However, others will require additional people, including adding to our board of directors, which will take longer to remediate.
In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:
1. Identify and retain one or two new directors for our board of directors including a member who is appropriately credentialed as a financial expert with a goal of having sufficient independent board of directors oversight;
2. Ensure all entity level controls are applied at all levels of the organization and are scalable for acquisition or merge targets; 3. Establish comprehensive formal general accounting policies and procedures and require directors or employees to sign off such policies and procedures as documentation of their understanding of and compliance with company policies; 4. Make all directors or employees subject to our Code of Ethics (including those employees in acquisition targets) and require all employees and directors to sign our Code of Ethics on an annual basis and retain the related documentation; and, 5. Implement better segregation of duties given the size of our company.
We believe that the above five initiatives have been at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of 2009, until we are able to hire additional personnel.
CONCLUSION
It is reasonably possible that, if not re-mediated, the identified material weakness noted above could result in a material misstatement in our reported financial statements that might result in a material misstatement in a future annual or interim period.
In light of the identified material weaknesses, management, performed (1) significant additional substantive review of those areas described above, and (2) performed additional analyses, including but not limited to a detailed balance sheet and statement of operations analytical review that compared changes from the prior period's financial statements and analyzed all significant differences. These procedures were completed so management could gain assurance that the financial statements and schedules included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The changes noted above, are the only changes during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.

AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT AND IDENTIFICATION OF AUDIT COMMITTEE
Our board of directors acts as our audit committee. No member of our board of directors is an "audit committee financial expert," as that term is defined in Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Our board of directors concluded that the benefits of retaining an individual who qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" would be outweighed by the costs of retaining such a person.
SECTION 16 (a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's executive officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock, to file initial reports of beneficial ownership on Form 3, changes in beneficial ownership on Form 4 and an annual statement of beneficial ownership on Form 5, with the SEC. Such executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all such forms that they have filed.
Based on our review of the copies of such forms filed with the SEC electronically, received by the Company and representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, all the officers, directors and more than 10% beneficial owners have complied with the above described filing requirements, except for Peter Chin and Kenneth Yeung. Kenneth Yeung, our President and a Director, inadvertently did not file a Form 4 in October 2009, covering his acquisition of 1,000,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. However, Mr. Yeung subsequently filed a Form 5 on February 9, 2010, which included his acquisition of the 1,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Peter Chin, our Corporate Secretary and a Director, inadvertently did not file a Form 4 in October 2009, covering his acquisition of 50,000 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock. However, Mr. Chin subsequently filed a Form 5 on February 9, 2010, which included such 50,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
CODE OF ETHICS
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to its employees and officers, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and any other persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics will be provided free of charge by the Company to interested parties upon request. Requests should be made in writing and directed to the Company at the following address: 17800 Castleton Street, Suite 638, City of Industry, California 91748. A copy of the Code of Ethics was attached as Exhibit 14 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
We have prepared the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis to provide you with information that we believe is necessary to understand our executive compensation policies and decisions as they relate to the compensation of our named executive officers.
We have only two members on our board of directors and do not currently have a compensation committee. However, we intend to expand our board of directors in the near future by appointing or electing at least two new directors who will be deemed to be independent directors. The presence of independent directors on our board of directors will allow us to form and constitute a compensation committee of our board of directors.
The primary objectives of the compensation committee with respect to executive compensation will be to (i) attract and retain the best possible executive talent available to us; (ii) motivate our executive officers to enhance our growth and profitability and increase shareholder value; and (iii) reward superior performance and contributions to the achievement of corporate objectives.
The focus of our executive pay strategy will be to tie short-term and long-term cash and equity incentives to the achievement of measurable corporate and individual performance objectives or benchmarks and to align executive compensation with the creation and enhancement of shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, our compensation committee will be tasked with developing and maintaining a transparent compensation plan that will tie a substantial portion of our executives' overall compensation to our sales, operational efficiencies and profitability.
Our board of directors has not set any performance objectives or benchmarks for 2010, as it intends for those objectives and benchmarks to be determined by the compensation committee once it is constituted and then approved by the board. However, we anticipate that compensation benefits will include competitive salaries, bonuses (cash and equity based), health insurance and stock option plans.
Our compensation committee will meet at least quarterly to assess the cost and effectiveness of each executive benefit and the performance of our executive officers in light of our revenues, expenses and profits.

As discussed under Item 2, above, on February 20, 2009, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with Allied Consultants, Inc., a company owned by Nelson Yeung, the brother of our President, Kenneth Yeung. Our board of directors believes the sublease is on terms fair and favorable to the Company.
ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The Company has renewed the engagement of HJ Associates & Consultants, LLP to serve as the independent accounting firm responsible for auditing our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the aggregate fees billed by the Company's auditors, for services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and for services provided in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for 2009, was $42,000. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, the aggregate fees billed by the Company's auditors, for services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB and for services provided in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for 2008, was $36,000.
(2) Audit-Related Fees. During fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, our auditors did not receive any fees for any audit-related services other than as set forth in paragraph (1) above.

(4) All Other Fees. None.
(5) Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures.
Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before Principal Accountants are engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be:
* approved by our audit committee (which consists of our entire board of directors); or * entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the board of directors' responsibilities to management.
The board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
The board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our principal accountants and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our principal accountants' independence.
During the 2009 and 2008 fiscal years, the Company used the following pre-approval procedures related to the selection of our independent auditors and the services they provide: unanimous consent of all directors via a board resolution.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors (A Development Stage Company) International Building Technologies Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Building Technologies Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and since re-entering the development stage on April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Building Technologies Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended and since re-entering the development stage on April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We were not engaged to examine management's assessment of the effectiveness of International Building Technologies Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statement, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has experienced negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statement. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION
International Building Technologies Group, Inc. (OTCBB: INBG) (the "Company") has four total subsidiaries, two active subsidiaries and two dormant subsidiaries.
Active Subsidiaries:
* International Building Technologies Co., Ltd. ("IBT Hong Kong") - a Hong Kong Corporation with equity interest of 100%
Dormant Subsidiaries:
* Scottsdale Diecast, Inc. - a Nevada Corporation with equity interest of 100% * Quadriga Motorsports, Inc. - a Nevada Corporation with equity interest of 100% * International Building Technologies, Inc. ("IBT") - a Nevada Corporation with equity interest of 80%
Currently the Company is focusing its attention on the rapidly growing and developing China building material market through its subsidiaries. The Company plans to manufacture and sell light weight building panels used in construction industries all over the world. The building panels can be used in a variety of ways to erect buildings up to six stories tall without the need of a traditional wood or steel frame structure. It is also versatile in its use and can be used to create unique architectural design elements. Management believes that the Company's panel based building technology allows for the rapid, cost effective construction of residential, commercial, and high-rise buildings utilizing materials that are greater in strength and appearance, economical and eco-friendly. Based on standard building codes prescribed by authorities worldwide, the Company's technology will meet and exceed the minimum requirements. Based on the panel technologies, the Company also provides customers with architectural design, panel supply, installation supervision, engineering, training, and technical support to work together with the other building material for construction applications. IBT Hong Kong has already established business relationship in securing several contractual rights to do business in China.
The Company had offices in Alameda, CA, and Shanghai, China in 2007. In December, 2008, the Company closed the office in Shanghai, China. In January, 2009, the Company closed the office in Alameda, CA and has moved to City of Industry, CA.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain reclassifications, which have no effect on net income (loss), have been made in the prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers all highly-liquid investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 and 2008.
FIXED ASSETS
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are being depreciated over the term of the lease, excluding option periods. When assets are disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation (net book value of the assets) are eliminated and any resultant gain or loss reflected accordingly. Upgrades and improvements are capitalized over their estimated useful lives whereas repairs and maintenance expenditures on the assets are charged to expense as incurred. Please see Note 4 - Fixed Assets for further detail. Total depreciation expense was $0 and $155 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The costs and accumulated depreciation of assets retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of were eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss was credited or charged to income, or applied to equity, as appropriate.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The license agreement was abandoned in accordance with FASB Accounting Codification Standards 360-10-20 (previous guidance Statement of Accounting No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets") and consequently the remaining value of the asset was fully amortized as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets in accordance with FASB Accounting Codification Standards 360-10-20 by measuring the carrying amounts of assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time the carrying value of such assets exceeds the fair value of such assets, impairment is recognized.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and other intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. As of December 31, 2008, the management has identified the impairment of the goodwill because of the business plans have not been carried out in a timely manner. The impairment was evaluated as $1,303,277 for the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the net value of the goodwill was zero. Accordingly, the Company's annual goodwill impairment test did not identify any impairment in accordance with FASB Accounting Codification Standards 350 - "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other" (previous guidance Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.")
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
INCOMES TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FASB Accounting Codification Standards 740 - "Income Taxes" (previous guidance Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," ("FAS 109") and related interpretations and guidance including FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48")). Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment.
When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of income.
TRANSLATION OF NON-U.S. CURRENCY AMOUNTS
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income not affecting retained earnings within Stockholders' equity.
Inventories, plant, rental machines and other property-net, and other non-monetary assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars, or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, are translated at approximate exchange rates prevailing when the company acquired the assets or liabilities. All other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Cost of sales and depreciation are translated at historical exchange rates. All other income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
Current and historical exchange rates are not indicative of what future exchange rates will be and should not be construed as such.
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
Relevant exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements of the subsidiary are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (denoted in Hong Kong dollars per one U.S. dollar):
2009 2008 ------ ------ Current exchange rate at December 31, HKD 7.7551 7.7507 Weighted average exchange rate 7.7522 7.7874
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items.
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. As the Company incurred net losses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, common stock equivalents were excluded from diluted net loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive. As a result, for all periods presented, the Company's basic and diluted net loss per share is the same.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
FASB Accounting Codification Standards (ACS) Topic 825, "Compensation - Stock Compensation" (previous guidance Statement of Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment") requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). During the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company did not recognize any of compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation. Under FASB ACS Topic 825, the expense recognition for variable awards is the same under the intrinsic value and the fair value methods.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On July 1, 2009, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification(TM) ("ASC") became the sole source of authoritative Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") literature recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Rules and interpretive releases of the Security Exchange Commission ("SEC") under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. Except for applicable SEC rules and regulations and a limited number of grandfathered standards, all other sources of GAAP for nongovernmental entities were superseded by the issuance of ASC. ASC did not change GAAP, but rather combined the sources of GAAP and the framework for selecting among those sources into a single source. Accordingly, the adoption of ASC had no impact on the financial results of the Company.
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
NOTE 2: MATERIAL EVENTS
CHANGE IN PAR VALUE
On May 22, 2008, the Company amended the articles of incorporation by adjusting the par value of the common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001. All shareholder equity accounts have been restated to reflect the adjustment to the par value as of the earliest date presented in the financial statements.
On August 11, 2008, the Company increased the authorized number of shares of preferred stock to 50,000,000 shares and amended the par value of preferred stock to $0.001.
AMENDMENT OF THE CONVERSION RATES OF THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES
On February 27, 2009, the Company amended the conversion feature of certain promissory notes. The original conversion features are summarized in Note 4. The amended conversion feature states that at any time, the Payee may convert all or part of the remaining principal balance and accrued interest into shares of the Company's Common Stock based on 75% of the average of the twenty closing prices in the past 20 trading days immediately preceding such conversion so long as such conversions shall not exceed 4.99% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company.
AMENDMENT OF THE CONVERSION RATES OF THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES
On July 10, 2009, the Company made the decision to rescind the Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement that signed with Wuhan Interpower Co. Ltd on April 17, 2008. The Company believes that the decision was made for the best interest of the company and the investors. The Company has requested that Wuhan Interpower Co., Ltd. immediately refund the US$161,500. According to the correspondence being exchanged recently, as of July 31, 2009, Wuhan Interpower Co., Ltd. has neither agreed to fully refund of US$161,500 nor refused to do so, despite our several requests in writings. The Company is going to seek legal assistance in China to recover the said amount plus interest.
In November, 2009, Wuhan Interpower Co., Ltd agreed to pay 50%, $80,750, of the investment deposit back to the Company. In considering the cost involved in lawsuit or arbitration in China, the Company has accepted this settlement. Accordingly, the loss on investment increased by $80,750 in the current year and the investment deposit decreased to $80,750. The return of the deposit was received in December, 2009.
AMENDMENT ON THE ARTICLE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED SHARES
The Company had authorized capital stock of 2,000,000,000 shares, including 1,950,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. On August 10, 2009, our Board of Directors and the shareholders holding a majority of the voting rights in the Company approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock to 4,000,000,000 including 3,950,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
NOTE 3: GOING CONCERN
The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its obligations on a timely basis and/or obtain financing as may be required. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has incurred
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
net losses from operations prior to reentering the development stage and has a stockholders' deficit of $5,534,336. Since the inception of reentering the development stage on April 1, 2007, the Company has a stockholders' deficit of $7,813,920 as of December 31, 2009. The Company has a working capital deficit of $3,419,108 as of December 31, 2009. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
During the next 12 months, the Company's foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with reviewing or investigating any potential business ventures. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock and loans from its shareholders and private investors to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company's stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company's failure to do so could have a material and adverse affect upon it and its shareholders.
The Company has entered into negotiation with a private owned company in China for a possible merger and joint venture and will announce the terms and condition of such merger or joint venture if the transaction proceeds and when there is a signed LOI, MOU or a binding agreement.
In the past 12 months, the Company funded operations through debt and securities issuances. For the coming 12 months, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances, focus on a possible joint venture or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated above.
NOTE 4: FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets consist of the following:
12/31/2009 12/31/2008 ---------- ---------- Furniture, fixtures and equipment (at cost) $ -- $ -- Less accumulated depreciation -- -- ------ ------ Fixed assets, net $ -- $ -- ====== ======
The Company disposed all the fixed office equipment and furniture in Shanghai office in exchange for two months rent in 2008. The gain on disposal of the equipment and furniture was $2,565 for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Depreciation expense for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $0. Total depreciation expense, including depreciation expense on discontinued operations $0 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

NOTE 5: NOTES PAYABLE & DEBT DISCOUNTS
The chart below summarizes the Notes Payable & Debt Discounts of the Company as of December 31, 2009. The Company is technically in default of its promissory notes to the above persons or entities, most of which notes matured on December 31, 2009.

NOTE 9: INCOME TAXES
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal Jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax has been made for the periods presented as the Company and
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008
its subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong have no assessable profits during the years being reported.
The Company believes sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realization of net operating loss carry-forwards and other timing differences for the periods presented. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been provided for the entire amount related thereto. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $444,305 and $1,655,267 during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal and State income tax rates of 39% to pretax income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 due to the following:
Year Ended December 31, --------------------------------- 2009 2008 ----------- ----------- Book income $ (753,293) $(1,886,834) Change in derivative liability (12,532) 820,155 Stock for services/option expense 19,500 -- Accrued expenses - related party 77,512 16,270 Settlement -- 13,650 Amortization of beneficial conversion feature 511,980 -- Warrant amortization -- -- Minority interest -- -- Other 189 (122) Valuation Allowance 156,644 1,036,881 ----------- ----------- Total Income tax provision $ -- $ -- =========== ===========
At December 31, 2009, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $3,500,000 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2009 through 2029. No tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2009 consolidated financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry-forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry-forwards may be limited as to use in future years.
Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, --------------------------------- 2009 2008 ----------- ----------- Deferred tax assets: NOL carryover $ 1,378,500 $ 2,030,310 Accrued expenses - related party 107,122 16,270 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation -- (4,485) ----------- ----------- Valuation Allowance (1,485,622) (2,042,095) ----------- ----------- Total Income tax provision $ -- $ -- =========== ===========

ACQUISITION OF WUHAN WUFENG MACHINERY MANUFACTURING COMPANY, LTD.
On April 16, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 92% stake in Wuhan Wufeng Machinery Manufacturing Company, Ltd. ("Machinery Co.") from Wuhan Intepower Company, Ltd., a China Corporation ("Seller") pursuant to a Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement. After transferring a 4% stake to certain management personnel of the Machinery Co. at the close of the transaction, the Company will own a net interest of 88% of the equity securities of the Machinery Company. The closing of this acquisition will occur as soon as the audit of the books and accounts of the Machinery Co. is completed to the satisfaction of the Company and requisite governmental approvals are obtained. On June 24, 2008, the Company received requisite governmental approvals to proceed with this transaction and during the third quarter, the Company engaged PCAOB approved SEC auditors Albert Wong & Company to perform the audit of the Machinery Company. Currently, the auditors are performing the audit of the Machinery Company and the audit is expected to be completed soon. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has paid the 10% cash down payment on the acquisition. The convertible notes for the balance of the acquisition will be finalized pending the completion of the audit.
The Machinery Co. currently offers several lines of machineries and equipments which can be retooled to manufacture the panel production machineries that the Company endeavors to sell and utilize in several planned projects in China and other countries. The Machinery Co. currently has state of the art tools, experienced engineers, capability to design new lines of equipment, as well as strong customer service and after-sales support. Strategically, this acquisition will strongly support the Company's ability to supply the market for building panels and panel machineries in China and throughout the world.
The purchase consideration to be paid by the Company to the Seller will be approximately U.S. $1,500,000, consisting of cash for 10% of the purchase consideration, and three (3) Convertible Promissory Notes representing the balance of the purchase consideration. At the Seller's option the notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a value equivalent to the notes.
However, on July 10, 2009, the Company made the decision to rescind the Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Company believes that the decision was made for the best interest of the company and the investors. The Company has requested that Wuhan Intepower Co., Ltd. immediately refund the US$161,500. The Company will seek legal assistance in China to recover the said amount plus interest for the Company.
In November, 2009, Wuhan Interpower Co., Ltd agreed to pay 50%, $80,750, of the investment deposit back to the Company. In considering the cost involved in lawsuit or arbitration in China, the Company is going to accept this settlement. Accordingly, the loss on investment increased by $80,750 in the current period and the investment deposit decreased to $80,750. Wuhan Interpower Co., Ltd paid the Company back the deposit of $80,750 in December 2009.

available for issuance by approximately by 54,520,869,200 shares. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth Yeung, holds 2,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are convertible into 43,956,043,956 common shares of the Company.
Unless and until there is enough authorized common stock available to cover all common stock equivalents, Mr. Yeung will not convert any of his preferred shares. Furthermore, the stock is only convertible upon management's discretion. Management currently does not intend on converting such stock. Also, warrant options are not included in common stock equivalents although the exercise price of $0.25 for the warrant is less than the fair value of common stock of $0.0002 per share on December 31, 2009. The remaining common stock equivalent of 10,564,825,244 shares has been accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly, the excess common stock equivalents exceeding the total common stock available for issue is marked to market through earnings at the end of each reporting period. Utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following assumptions: estimated volatility of 564.36% a contractual life of approximately one year, a zero dividend rate, 0.45% risk free interest rate, exercise price of $0.0002 and the fair value of common stock of $0.0002 per share as of December 31, 2009, the Company determined the allocated fair value of the derivative liability. The Company reflected a gain of $32,133 in the year ended December 31, 2009 to adjust the derivative liability as of December 31, 2009, representing the initial fair value of excess common stock equivalents exceeding the total common stock available for issuance.
