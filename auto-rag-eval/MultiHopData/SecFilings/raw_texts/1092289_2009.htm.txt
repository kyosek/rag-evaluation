Item 2. Properties.
Turkey
General. We began 2009 with interests in twelve onshore exploration licenses in Turkey. As of March 15, 2010, we held interests in 33 onshore exploration licenses and one onshore production lease covering a total of 3.36 million gross acres (2.70 million net acres) in Turkey. The following is a map showing our interests in Turkey:
Selmo (Production Lease 829). Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired a production lease in the Selmo oil field on Block 829. The lease covers 8,886 acres (36 square kilometers) in southeastern Turkey. We have drilled the S-51, S-52, S-53, S-54, S-58 and S-62 wells in the Selmo field, four of which are now in production. We are currently drilling the S-61 well. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner in the Selmo production lease. For 2009, our net production of crude oil in the Selmo field, after royalties, was 411,964 barrels of crude oil, at an average rate of 1,369 barrels per day. The lease is set to expire in June 2015 but can be renewed for an additional ten-year period based on continued production.
Edirne (License 3839). Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired an interest in an exploration license in the Edirne gas field on Block 3839, covering 119,125 acres (482 square kilometers) in the Thrace Basin of northwestern Turkey, on which there have been drilled eight successful shallow gas wells. We drilled and completed the Kirmizihoyuk-1 well and the Kusey Ikihoyuk-1 well on the Edirne license and successfully completed two other wells on the license in 2009. We completed 90% of a 90 square kilometer 3D seismic survey over the western portion of the Edirne license, and we expect to complete the remainder of the survey in the second quarter of 2010. In addition, we completed construction of a gathering system and facilities in the Thrace Basin necessary to begin selling natural gas from our discoveries in the Edirne gas field. In December 2009, we entered into a five-year gas sales agreement pursuant to which AKSA, a natural gas distributor in Turkey, agreed to purchase all of our gas production from the Edirne field. We will sell the gas at a price equal to a 15% discount to the Industrial Interruptible Tariff benchmark set by BOTAS. We expect our initial eight wells in the Edirne field to come online in April 2010. We expect our net production to exceed 5.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day starting in the second quarter of 2010. We have drilled, logged and cased two wells in 2010 and are currently drilling our third well. Upon completion of the third well, we plan to drill 16 or more additional wells on the Edirne license during the remainder of 2010. We are the operator and 55% working interest owner in the Edirne license.
Arpatepe (License 3118). Through the EOT acquisition, we acquired a 50% non-operated working interest in Block 3118, which covers approximately 96,000 acres (389 square kilometers) near the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey. In April and September 2008, EOT participated in the drilling of the Arpatepe-1 and Arpatepe-2 wells on Block 3118, which represent Turkey’s first and second economic discoveries of crude oil from deeper, onshore Paleozoic sandstone formations. The wells, which flowed naturally and were not stimulated, had initial production rates of approximately 440 and 190 gross barrels per day, respectively, from limited perforations. For 2009, our net production of crude oil in the Arpatepe field, after royalties, was 5,107 barrels of crude oil, at an average rate of 33 barrels per day. In early March 2010, we acidized the Arpatepe-1 well to clean up perforations and eliminate damage incurred during the initial completion in the Bedinan sandstone. The well is currently flowing at an average rate of approximately 500 gross barrels of oil per day. We are currently participating in the drilling of the Arpatepe-3 well, which the operator commenced drilling in December 2009.
Licenses 4173, 4174 and 4175. In June 2006, we were awarded three onshore exploration licenses in southeastern Turkey. The three licenses together cover a total of 162,762 acres (660 square kilometers) and expire in June 2010.
Two of the licenses, Block 4173 and Block 4174, are located near Bismil on the Tigris River. Our primary target is an under explored Paleozoic play at a depth of approximately 9,800 feet. The work program involves conducting geochemical studies and reprocessing existing 2D seismic data, and based on these results additional 2D seismic may be shot or a well drilled. In March 2008, we farmed-out 75% of our working interest in Blocks 4173 and 4174 to EOT. In exchange for a 75% interest in the exploration licenses, EOT drilled an exploration well at its cost to test the Bedinan Ordivician formation (approximately 3,700 meters) on one of the licenses. The well encountered mechanical difficulties shortly after encountering the target formation and was abandoned. Through the acquisition of EOT in July 2009, we are the operator and 100% working interest owner of Blocks 4173 and 4174. We have re-entered the Goksu-1 well on Block 4174 and plan to deepen it by approximately 3,000 feet.
The third license, Block 4175, is located near Cizre about 60 kilometers from the Iraq border. The target is a deep sub-thrust play similar to the major Iraqi and Iranian Zagros fields to the south. We have conducted an initial work program of detailed fieldwork and geochemical analysis on this license. In the first quarter of 2009, we completed a 105
kilometers 2D seismic shoot over the license. We plan to drill the initial well on Block 4175 in the first half of 2010. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner of Block 4175.
Hakkari (Licenses 4268, 4269 and 4270). In July 2007, we were awarded three additional onshore exploration licenses, Blocks 4268, 4269 and 4270, all of which are in southeastern Turkey on the border with Iraq. The three licenses cover a total of 334,600 acres (1,354 square kilometers) and expire in June 2010, but can be extended for an additional year by posting a $50,000 bond. These licenses will also involve a work program, including technical studies, reprocessing of data and contingent plans for drilling wells. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner of these licenses. Our work program on these blocks has been delayed due to security concerns.
Malatya (Licenses 4572, 4573, 4574, 4575, 4576, 4577, 4659 and 4660). In August 2008, we were awarded exploration licenses by the GDPA on Blocks 4572, 4573, 4574, 4575, 4576 and 4577 covering an aggregate of 733,901 acres (2,970 square kilometers) in the Malatya area of south-central Turkey. We paid a party who will be a 10% participant in these licenses cash consideration and agreed that that party would back-in after payout for 10% in the first well to be drilled on these licenses. We are the operator and 90% working interest owner of these licenses, which expire in August 2012. In January 2010, we acquired two additional licenses (Licenses 4659 and 4660) in the Malatya area of south-central Turkey.
Tuz Golu and Haymana (Licenses 4310, 4311, 4314, 4315, 4316, 4317, 4342 and 4344). Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired a 50% working interest in exploration licenses on Blocks 4310, 4311, 4314, 4315, 4316, 4317, 4342 and 4344 covering an aggregate of 870,000 acres (3,521 square kilometers) in the Tuz Golu Basin south of Ankara in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored basin and expire in May 2012. In February 2010, we acquired the remaining 50% working interest in these licenses in exchange for a 2% overriding royalty interest. We recently conducted field geology studies over the area to facilitate the next phase of exploration on these licenses. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner in these licenses.
Midyat (Licenses 3969, 3970, 3971 and 3972). Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired exploration licenses on Blocks 3969, 3970, 3971 and 3972 covering an aggregate of 460,400 acres (1,863 square kilometers) in Midyat in southeastern Turkey. These licenses expire in November 2010. We recently conducted a gravity survey over these licenses to assist us in identifying prospective areas of the licenses. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner in these licenses.
Gurun (License 4325). In April 2009, we farmed-in to an exploration license on Block 4325 for cash consideration and the obligation to carry a 10% interest in the first well drilled to earn 90% interest in the license. To date, we have conducted field geology over this license. Block 4325 covers 122,246 acres (495 square kilometers) in south-central Turkey. We are the operator of the license, which expires in February 2012.
License 4262. Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired an exploration license on Block 4262, covering 2,805 acres (12 square kilometers) in southeastern Turkey. We drilled the Atesler well on Block 4262 to a depth of 10,851 feet. We tested the Atesler well in early August 2009 and determined that the well was non-commercial. The Atesler well has been plugged and abandoned. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner in this license, which we plan to relinquish upon completion of abandonment and reclamation activities and submission of a final report to the GDPA.
Other. In February 2010, we entered into a farm-in agreement to acquire a 50% interest in a license in southeastern Turkey. We reimbursed the operator past costs of $1.5 million and will pay 50% of the cost of the well currently being drilled by the operator, the Pinarbarsi-1. We will pay the operator $1.0 million when the well is successfully drilled. In March 2010, we entered into a farm-in agreement to acquire a 50% interest in an additional license in southeastern Turkey. We will drill the Bakuk-101 well to earn the 50% interest in the license. In March 2010, we entered into a farm-in agreement to acquire a 50% interest in five licenses in south-central Turkey. To earn the interest, we will pay 62.5% of total drilling and seismic costs until 12.5% of total drilling and seismic costs paid equals $750,000. Thereafter, we will pay 50% of drilling and seismic costs incurred. In December 2008, we leased an equipment yard in Diyarbakir and started shipping tubulars, drilling equipment and supplies into the country in support of our planned drilling activities. With the acquisition of Incremental, we acquired a second yard at Selmo and have since purchased acreage and started an equipment yard on the Edirne license to support our Thrace Basin drilling activities. We currently own 5 drilling rigs located in Turkey and manage 2 other drilling rigs for Viking in Turkey.
We had total net proved reserves of 10,426 Mbbl at the Selmo and Arpatepe oil fields and 7,339 MMcf at the Edirne gas field as of December 31, 2009.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. Royalties are at 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. The licenses have a four-year term but after the third year, a payment in the form of a bond must be made to extend the license if no new well has been drilled prior to that date. The GDPA, the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey, awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA.
A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for petroleum. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. No single company may own more than eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the hectares under the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder applies to covert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares, to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years. Annual rentals are due based on the hectares comprising the lease.
Morocco
General. We own interests in ten onshore exploration permits in northern Morocco. The following is a map showing our interests in Morocco:
Guercif. In June 2005, we were awarded the Guercif-Beni Znassen reconnaissance license covering 3.4 million acres (13,750 square kilometers) in northeastern Morocco. In January 2008, we converted a portion of our Guercif-Beni Znassen reconnaissance license into two exploration permits covering a total of 962,000 acres (3,893 square kilometers) in the Guercif area in northeastern Morocco, pursuant to a petroleum agreement with the national oil company of Morocco, Office of National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (“ONHYM”).
Pursuant to a participation agreement between us (30%), Stratic Energy Corporation (“Stratic”) (20%) and Sphere Petroleum QSC (“Sphere”) (50%), Sphere agreed to bear the entire cost of an initial three-year work program to earn its 50% interest in the two Guercif exploration permits. In addition, Sphere posted a $2 million bank guarantee for the initial work program with the Moroccan government and agreed to reimburse us and Stratic for our respective back costs. In April 2008, Sphere assigned all of its interests in the Guercif participation agreement to Longe in exchange for Longe’s assumption of all of Sphere’s obligations under those agreements. We acquired Longe in December 2008. As a result, we are the operator and 80% working interest owner of the Guercif exploration permits.
The Guercif exploration permits are for an eight-year term divided into three periods, each with a defined work program. Under the initial three-year work program, we have re-entered, logged and tested the MSD-1 well, a well previously drilled in the area, which we completed as a dry hole in the fourth quarter of 2008. The logs and test failed to establish the presence of hydrocarbons. We are committed to drill another well before the end of 2010 and will carry the 20% owner in the Guercif exploration permits in that well. In addition, we replaced our obligation to acquire 300 kilometers of 2D seismic with the obligation to drill another well.
Tselfat. In May 2006, we were awarded the Tselfat exploration permit covering 222,345 acres (900 square kilometers) in
northern Morocco pursuant to a petroleum agreement with ONHYM. Tselfat has three fields, Haricha, Brou Draa and Tselfat, that produced from the early 1920s to 1970s, with limited production continuing into the 1990s. All of the wells are presently abandoned. The Tselfat permit provides several opportunities including redevelopment of the existing fields, extensions of known productive horizons and exploration of higher impact targets at depth.
In August 2007, we reached an agreement to farm-out 50% of our interest in the Tselfat exploration permit to Sphere. In exchange for an option to acquire 50% of our interest in the Tselfat permit, Sphere agreed to fund the costs to acquire a 3D seismic survey over the Haricha field and northern portion of the Brou Draa field and fund the cost of additional geological studies. Upon the exercise of its option, Sphere agreed to fund the drilling and testing of an exploratory well and replace our bank guarantee deposited with the Moroccan government. In April 2008, Sphere assigned all of its interests in the Tselfat farm-out and option agreement to Longe in exchange for Longe’s assumption of all of Sphere’s obligations under those agreements. We acquired Longe in December 2008. As a result, we have a 100% working interest and operate the Tselfat permit.
Since the award of the Tselfat exploration permit, we have been collecting, collating, digitizing and reviewing all of the existing well, production, seismic and other data. We have reprocessed some of the 2D seismic that exists over the block. In addition, we shot a 175 square kilometer 3D seismic survey over the Brou Draa and Haricha fields, which was completed in the second quarter of 2008. We drilled the HR-33bis well in the Haricha field on the Tselfat exploration permit to help assess whether there is the opportunity for redevelopment of the previously produced but abandoned Haricha field. We plan to complete our testing of this well in the second quarter of 2010. We plan to begin drilling one deeper exploration well, the BTK-1, by the end of the second quarter of 2010 and plan to drill two additional shallow exploration wells on the Tselfat permit in 2010. We posted a $3.0 million bank guarantee in support of the program, of which $2.0 million has been returned to us.
Ouezzane-Tissa and Asilah. In July 2008, we agreed to farm-in to five Ouezzane-Tissa and two Asilah exploration permits held by Direct in northern Morocco. The Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits cover a combined area of 2,355,606 acres (9,353 square kilometers). The Asilah exploration permits cover a combined area of 680,578 acres (2,754 square kilometers). Under the farm-in agreement, we will earn a 50% interest in the Ouezzane-Tissa and Asilah exploration permits by carrying Direct for 100% of the costs of drilling three wells on the Ouezzane-Tissa and Asilah permits. If one of the three wells is a commercial success, as defined in the farm-in agreement, then we would carry Direct in the drilling of a fourth well. Longfellow has posted a $25.0 million guaranty of our obligations under the farm-in agreement with Direct. We became the operator of the Ouezzane-Tissa and Asilah exploration permits after receiving government approval. The initial period of the Ouezzane-Tissa permits expire in August 2010. We drilled our first well on the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits, the OZW-1 well. We encountered an extremely high pressure water zone near 9,000 feet which we could not drill through and plugged and abandoned the well. We are currently drilling at our cost our second well on the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits, the HKE-1 well. Upon completion of this well, we are required under the terms of the farm-in agreement to drill another well on the Ouezzanne-Tissa permits in 2010. In 2009, we extended the Asilah permits into the second period of the exploration permit and reduced the Asilah acreage by approximately 20%. The Asilah permits expire in May 2012. On the Asilah permits, we conducted a 2D seismic survey in late 2008 and recently acquired 200 kilometers of 2D seismic, and in 2009, we acquired an additional approximately 90 kilometers of 2D seismic on the Asilah permits. We are evaluating the data for a planned well on the Asilah permits in 2010.
Other. We lease an equipment yard in Meknes, and we currently have two drilling rigs located in Morocco.
There are no reserves associated with our Moroccan properties as of December 31, 2009.
Commercial Terms. During the exploration phase of each exploration permit, we and our partners, if any, will operate and bear 100% of the costs to earn a 75% interest. Our interests are subject to the 25% interest held by ONHYM, which is carried by us and our partners, if any, during the exploration phase, all of which is governed by the applicable petroleum agreement. ONHYM pays its share of costs in the development phase. Once a discovery is made, the area covered by the discovery is converted into an exploitation concession, which is governed by the applicable association contract. Under an exploitation concession, we and our partners, if any, (75%) and ONHYM (25%) will each pay our respective share of costs. Upon conversion to an exploitation concession, we will pay a discovery bonus to ONHYM, and when certain sustained daily production levels are reached, we will pay one-time production bonuses. At Tselfat, Ouezzane-Tissa and Asilah, the discovery bonus at conversion is $500,000 and the one-time production bonuses are as follows: 15,000 Bbls/day-$750,000; 25,000 Bbls/day-$1 million; 35,000 Bbls/day-$2 million and 50,000 Bbls/day-$3 million. At Guercif, the discovery bonus at conversion is $500,000 and the one-time production bonuses are as follows: 10,000 Bbls/day-$500,000; 20,000 Bbls/day-$750,000; 30,000 Bbls/day-$1 million and 50,000 Bbls/day-$3 million. These production bonuses are deductible and are treated as development costs for Moroccan tax purposes. There is a ten-year tax holiday on revenues from petroleum production commencing in the year in which production begins. After ten years, the corporate tax rate is 30%. Oil and gas exploration activities are exempt from both value added tax and customs duties.
The royalty paid to the Moroccan government for onshore production is 10% on oil and 5% on gas. In addition, the first approximately 2.1 Mmbbl of oil production and the first approximately 11 Bcf of gas production are exempt from royalty. Once an area is converted into an exploitation concession, we are required to pay annual surface rentals of $2.85 per acre.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Morocco for oil and gas concessions occurs in three stages: reconnaissance license, exploration permit and then exploitation concession.
Under a reconnaissance license, the government grants exploration rights for a one-year term to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, but not drilling. The size may be very large and generally is unexplored or under-explored. The
reconnaissance license may be extended for up to one additional year. Interests under a reconnaissance license are not transferable. The recipient of a reconnaissance license commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. At the end of the term of the reconnaissance license, the license holder must designate one or more areas for conversion to an exploration permit or relinquish all rights.
An exploration permit, which is codified in a petroleum agreement with ONHYM, is for a term of up to eight years and covers an area not to exceed 2,000 square kilometers. Under an exploration permit, exploration and appraisal studies and operations are undertaken in order to establish the existence of oil and gas in commercially exploitable quantities. This generally entails the drilling of exploration wells to establish the presence of oil and/or gas and such additional appraisal wells as may be necessary to determine the limits and the productive capacity of a hydrocarbon deposit to determine whether or not to go forward to develop and produce the prospect. The eight-year term under an exploration permit is divided into three separate terms, each with a duration of two to three years. A distinct work program is negotiated for each separate term and the oil company then must post a bank guarantee to cover the cost of the work program for that term. The interests under an exploration permit are 75% to the oil company and 25% to ONHYM. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable. However, 100% of the costs of all activities under an exploration permit are borne by the oil company.
An exploitation concession is applied for upon the discovery of a commercially exploitable field. The concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The maximum duration of an exploitation concession is 25 years. Once an exploitation concession becomes effective, then the costs incurred for the development of the field are to be funded by the parties in proportion to their respective percentage interests, which is 75% to the oil company and 25% to ONHYM. The oil company serves as operator. The oil company and ONHYM enter into an association contract (similar to a joint operating agreement) to govern operations on the concession. Interests under an exploitation concession are transferable. All production is sold at market prices. A bonus (the amount of which is negotiated at the time of negotiation of a petroleum agreement) is paid to the government by the oil company upon conversion to an exploitation concession, and additional production bonuses are also paid when certain production levels from the exploitation concession are achieved. The levels of production and the amount of production bonuses are negotiated as part of a petroleum agreement.
Romania
General. We own interests in four onshore production licenses in Romania. The following is a map showing our interests in Romania:
Izvoru, Vanatori and Marsa. In February 2006, we were awarded the Izvoru, Vanatori and Marsa licenses, covering approximately 1,200 acres (5 square kilometers), 780 acres (4 square kilometers) and 188 acres (1 square kilometer), respectively. The fields on the licenses were discovered by the former Romanian national oil company and are all located within 100 kilometers of Romania’s capital, Bucharest. The licenses were awarded to us based upon our commitment to perform certain work programs on each of the respective fields, including shooting seismic and drilling or re-entering wells. There is no current production from any of the licenses. We are the operator and 100% working interest owner of the fields. We entered into petroleum agreements with the Romanian government covering each license, which were finalized in September 2007 and expire in August 2010.
The initial work program includes the drilling of two new wells in the Izvoru field. We shot a 25 square kilometer 3D seismic survey over the Izvoru field in late 2006. We shot a 2D seismic survey over both Vanatori and Marsa fields in late 2006. In 2009, we drilled two wells on the Izvoru license, two wells on the Vanatori license and one well on the Marsa license. Both wells on the Izvoru license were unsuccessful and will be plugged and abandoned as dry holes. The first well on the Vanatori license failed to reach total depth and was plugged and abandoned. We skid the rig to drill a second well on the Vanatori license. We are currently evaluating the Marsa well and the second Vanatori well.
Sud Craiova. In June 2009, we entered into an agreement to farm-in to Sterling’s Sud Craiova Block E III-7, covering approximately 1.5 million acres (6,070 square kilometers) in western Romania. In exchange for a 50% working interest, we agreed to drill three exploration wells on the Sud Craiova license, each to a depth of approximately 3,280 feet (1,000 meters). At casing point in each well, we and Sterling will each elect whether to proceed to completion and will each bear our proportionate share of completion and infrastructure costs. Sterling will remain the operator of the Sud Craiova license. We began drilling the first of the three exploration wells at our cost on the Sud Craiova license in November 2009. The NG-02 well encountered gas shows and is being tested, and the NG-04 well has been plugged and abandoned because it was non-commercial. The NG-01 well has been drilled and is awaiting testing.
We lease an equipment yard in Izvoru. We do not own any drilling rigs in Romania.
There are no reserves associated with our Romanian properties as of December 31, 2009.
Commercial Terms. Romania’s current petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties, excise tax and income tax. Two forms of royalty are payable as:
•
a percentage of the value of gross production on a field basis, such percentage being fixed on a sliding scale depending on production levels. The production royalty rate varies between 3.5% to 13.5% for crude oil and between 3% to 13% for natural gas production; and
•
a fixed percentage of the gross income obtained from the transportation and transit of petroleum through the national pipeline system and from petroleum operations carried out through oil terminals belonging to the state. The royalty rate is currently fixed at 5%.
The license holder pays Romanian corporate income tax, but enjoys a one-year income tax holiday from the first day of production. Corporate income tax is assessed at a rate of 16%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes. Excise duty is payable on crude oil and natural gas at the rate of 4 Euro per ton of crude oil and 7.4 Euro per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas. Excise tax is not payable on crude oil or natural gas delivered as royalty to the Romanian government or on quantities directly exported. Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Romania are subject to a dividend withholding tax at between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary for the conduct of petroleum operations. There is also a 19% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The Ministry of Industry and Resources of Romania has responsibility for petroleum policy and strategy. The National Agency for Mineral Resources (“NAMR”) was set up in 1993 to administer and regulate petroleum operations. When licenses are to be made available, NAMR publishes a list of available blocks for concession in the Official Gazette. Foreign and Romanian companies must register their interest by a specified date and must submit applications by an application deadline. Applicants are required to prove their financial capacity, technical expertise and other requirements as required by NAMR. The licensing rounds are competitive and the winning bid is based on a scoring system.
NAMR negotiates the terms of agreements granting the licenses with the winning licensee and the license agreement is then submitted to the Romanian government for its approval. The date of government approval is the effective date of the license. Blocks which fail to attract a prescribed level of bids are re-offered in a subsequent licensing round. NAMR may issue a prospecting permit or a petroleum concession. A prospecting permit is for the conduct of geological mapping, magnetometry, gravimetry, seismology, geochemistry, remote sensing and drilling of wildcat wells in order to determine the general geological conditions favoring petroleum accumulations. A petroleum concession provides exclusive rights to conduct petroleum exploration and production under a petroleum agreement.
United States
With the acquisition of Incremental, we acquired interests in three projects in the San Joaquin Valley in central California: farm-outs on the McFlurrey project and the South East Kettleman North Dome oil field and a small non-operated working interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit. Incremental acquired these projects in May 2008.
The McFlurrey farm-out covers 9,100 net acres of leasehold in Kings, Fresno and Kerns counties in California. We drilled two wells in March and April 2009, paying 100% of the cost. We tested the first well and determined it was non-commercial. Based on these results, we did not test the second well. The South East Kettleman North Dome farm-out covers 1,155 net acres of leasehold in Kings County northeast of the McFlurrey farm-out. In February 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with our partner in the McFlurrey and South East Kettleman North Dome farm-outs to settle certain disagreements between us and our partner. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we resigned as operator of the farm-outs and transferred ownership of the two McFlurrey wells to the partner, subject to our obligation to plug and abandon the first well at our cost. In addition, we agreed to pay the partner for our share of the costs of plugging and abandoning, and cleaning up and restoring the surface and well site of the second well. We estimate our costs for plugging, abandonment and restoration of the two wells will be approximately $65,000.
We own a non-operated working interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit located in Kings County California. This unit produces approximately 125 gross barrels of oil per day along with small amounts of associated natural gas. We own a 5% interest in five existing wells on the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit (three are currently producing). On all new projects and well proposals submitted and completed after May 16, 2008, we will own a 10% non-operated working interest. The operator plans to recomplete two of the five wells located in the unit. Plans for further development will be addressed after the results of the two recompletions are evaluated. We are currently seeking purchasers for our interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit.
In Oklahoma, we lease two properties, one in Dewey County (128 net acres) and one in McClain County (29 net acres). We participated for a 20% non-operated working interest in a well drilled on the Dewey County property at the end of 2006 that is currently producing a small amount of oil and natural gas.
There are no reserves associated with our U.S. properties as of December 31, 2009.
Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves
The following table summarizes our proved reserves in Turkey at December 31, 2009 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
(1) The conversion factor we have applied in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is the current convention used by many oil and gas companies, where six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas is equal to one barrel (“Bbl”) of oil. The barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”) conversion ratio we use is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. It may not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, present value at 10% (“PV-10”) and total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2009:
(1) Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The standardized measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our standardized measure:
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain an outside independent engineering firm to prepare estimates of our proved reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Our internal audit department has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2009. Senior management reviews and approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of four outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved reserves presented as of December 31, 2009 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our external engineers. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates are independent petroleum engineers and geoscientists that meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultants to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to independent petroleum consultants for preparation of their reserves estimates. Our senior reservoir engineer oversees the reserve estimation process. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. He has over 10 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including experience in operations, drilling and reservoir engineering, and is a member of multiple professional organizations.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 21-Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves and standard measure information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The proved reserves estimates prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a detailed review of our Arpatepe, Edirne and Selmo properties in Turkey. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
Oil and Gas Reserves under Canadian Law
As a reporting issuer under Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario securities laws, we are required under Canadian law to comply with National Instrument 51-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities” (“NI 51-101”) implemented by the members of the Canadian Securities Administrators in all of our reserves related disclosures. Under NI 51-101, proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. Under NI 51-101, reported proved reserves should target, under a specific set of economic conditions, at least a 90% probability that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2009, our estimated proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves were approximately 5.20 Mmboe. We had no PUDs at December 31, 2008.
