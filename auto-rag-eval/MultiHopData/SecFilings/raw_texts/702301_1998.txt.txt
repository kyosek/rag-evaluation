Pedestrian access is also available from Sixth Street South and Marquette Avenue; a grand ceremonial entrance to the building on Sixth Street South incorporates a rotunda and retail banking function.
THE PARTNERSHIP
Norwest Center is owned by NWC Limited Partnership ("NWC"), a partnership in which the Company owns a 50.0% general partnership interest through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. Sixth and Marquette Limited Partnership ("S&M") owns a 49.0% managing general partnership interest and a 1.0% limited partnership interest in NWC. The managing general partner of NWC is currently S&M. The Company has the right, at its sole discretion, to become the managing general partner of NWC. Due to the above factors, the Company consolidates NWC. Norwest Center is managed by Hines Interests Limited Partnership ("Hines").
Under the partnership agreement governing NWC, the managing general partner has the right to manage and operate NWC's business. Until certain cash flow levels have been achieved for two consecutive years (the "NWC Preference Period"), S&M and the Company each hold a 50.0% interest in NWC. After the NWC Preference Period ends, the Company will be entitled to hold a 60.0% interest (subject to increases in the Company's interest that may result from early termination of the NWC Preference Period), and S&M a 40.0% interest. The Company does not expect the NWC Preference Period to end in the foreseeable future.
During the NWC Preference Period, the Company is entitled to receive an annual preference return (the "NWC Preference Return") equal to 7.0% of its capital base, which was $92.3 million as of December 31, 1998. The NWC Preference Return is cumulative, and if operating revenues (after payment of operating costs, capital expenditures and debt service) are not sufficient to fund the distribution of any NWC Preference Return then due, the amount of such deficiency shall accumulate and shall bear interest at the rate of 7.0%, compounded annually. Currently, there is no accrued deficiency outstanding on the NWC Preference Return.
Subject to the preferential distributions to the Company described above, all of NWC's operating revenues remaining after making payments required for the operations of NWC and Norwest Center and the payment of debt service will be distributed 50.0% to the Company and 50.0% to S&M during the NWC Preference Period.

Third Partnership is the successor in interest as lessee under a lease, expiring in 2005, of the Galland and Seneca Buildings.
The Company holds the right, at its sole discretion, to elect to become the managing general partner of Third Partnership. Due to the above factors, the Company consolidates Third Partnership. 1212 Partnership was originally the only general partner and is now the managing general partner with the obligation to manage and operate Third Partnership's business.
Until certain cash flow levels have been achieved for two consecutive years (the "Washington Preference Period"), all of Third Partnership's operating revenues remaining after making payments required for: (i) the operations of Third Partnership and Washington Mutual Tower; (ii) net Block 6 costs; (iii) the payment of debt service; and (iv) the Washington Preference Returns (defined below), will be distributed 50.0% to the Company and 50.0% to 1212 Partnership. The Washington Preference Period is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. During the Washington Preference Period, the Company is also entitled to receive an annual preference return (the "Washington Preference Return") equal to 8.0% of its capital base, which was $100.0 million as of December 31, 1998. The Washington Preference Return is cumulative, and if operating revenues, adjusted for payment of operating costs, capital expenditures and debt service are insufficient to fund the distribution of any Washington Preference Return then due, the amount of such deficiency shall accumulate and shall bear interest at the rate of 8.0%, compounded annually. As of December 31, 1998, the Company is due a cumulative preference deficit, including accrued interest, of approximately $9.7 million, which will be reduced as cash flow becomes available. On a priority basis to the Washington Preference Return described above, the Company also receives a 9.53% return on an additional equity investment of $47.0 million made in September 1995. The Company is entitled to receive this return through September 30, 2003, at which time the rate of return will adjust based on conditions in the interest rate markets.
