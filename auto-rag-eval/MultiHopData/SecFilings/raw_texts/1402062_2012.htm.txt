Prospective Gold Projects
The following is a brief overview of our portfolio of prospective mineral properties, the exploration developments on them where applicable and some of the details of the historical option agreements for them. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, our exploration work was primarily concentrated on the Singida, Kinyambwiga, Uyowa and North Mara gold projects.
Musoma Bunda Murangi Gold Project
Exploration Strategy
The Company recently purchased a mobile auger rig to provide soil sampling services to its gold projects
Much of the low-lying areas, including the drainages around Lake Victoria, in the northern part of Tanzania, are covered by a blanket of dark grey clays known as Black Cotton Soil or locally as “mbuga” clays. These clays, believed to be lacustrine sediments derived from periodic flooding of Lake Victoria, have masked the underlying land surface, covering both in-situ soils and rock outcrops and allowing little to no chemical dispersion from the underlying substrate to pass through to the surface. Depths of the “mbuga” vary between a few centimetres to in excess of 10 meters thick. Exploration for mineral deposits is thus both difficult and costly.
Exploration over these “mbuga” covered areas is largely done by various geophysical techniques to map out the geophysical properties of the underlying rock sequences and the structural imprint in order to interpret potential gold targets. Follow up drilling is required to test these targets.
The Company intends to test the geophysical targets interpreted across many of their “mbuga” covered Project areas, including but not limited to the Suguti, Murangi, Kinyambwiga, Kalemela and the Tarime licenses in the Lake Victoria District by utilising the recently acquired auger rig to sample the soil/saprock interface beneath the “mbuga” by systematic sampling programmes. The auger rig has the capability to drill holes to depths in excess of 20 meters and, with the specially designed sampling tool, can collect a sample at the bottom of the hole.
Exploration work has been focused on the Kinyambwiga and Suguti licenses.
Kinyambwiga PL4653/2007
Exploration has been focused around Kanunga 1 Prospect as a continuation of the exploration activities undertaken during the 3rd Quarter which included:
i.
Schlumberger N-S profiles (17) completed along strike to the east and west of Kanunga 1 Prospect delineated 2 distinct chargeability anomalies consistent with the strike of the known structure (Map 1)
Map 1: Plan showing the location of the Schlumberger IP profiles across the interpolated mineralized structure of Kanunga 1.
Schlumberger coincident chargeability/resistivity anomalies. Samples collected from pits spaced 10 meters apart across the IP anomaly, returned low gold values of <14ppb gold.
Map 2: Plan showing the position of soil anomalies
iii.
Pitting and trenching programs were undertaken at Kanunga Far East to validate the anomalous Rotary Air Blast (RAB) intercepts reported in 2009. Of the planned 94 meters of trenching, only 76 meters were completed due to the presence of the school. Granite was encountered in all the trenches with no gold values. However, a sample of the quartz stone layer lying above the basement granite did return a value of 2.28 g/t Au. In conclusion, it appears that the anomalous RAB intercepts may have been the result of contamination from the stone layer and therefore would not represent an in situ anomaly.
iv. Auger drilling
The auger rig arrived in country in November 2011 and has been deployed in testing the immediate strike extensions of the subsurface Kanunga 1 gold vein at the Kinyambwiga Prospect. A number of additional N-S sample traverses have been undertaken further east along strike of the Kanunga 1 vein to validate previously reported soil anomalies

Results
A total of 142 auger holes were drilled on Kinyambwiga during the latter part of 2011 and early 2012. Progress was seriously hampered by the onset of the rainy season coupled with local cultivation. The samples (44) collected during 2011 were submitted for 50gm Fire Assay analysis whereas those samples (96) collected during 2012 were submitted for 500 gm BLEG analysis for gold except for 7 rock samples collected from the stone layer that were fire assayed (no sample was collected from one auger hole due to encountering water down-hole).
The thickness of “mbuga” cover was found to average 2.61 meters. Sampling of the immediate underlying granitic saprock was taken with care in order to ensure no contamination with the overlying “mbuga” clays. Logging of the auger hole is undertaken on site, a 1 kilo sample is collected at the bottom of the hole with the designed sample catcher, emptied into a plastic sample bag, labeled and stapled closed. The sample is then packed with the other samples in a rice sack and kept in the vehicle until the end of the day when the samples are returned for safe keeping at the field camp.
Results are shown in Table 2.

The results of sampling the quartz stone layer (7 samples) varied from 156 ppb gold to 2.56g/t gold. Five additional samples were collected from different auger holes, the results of which are included in Table 3.
A number of N-S sample traverses on a sample spacing of 5 meters was completed on the western end of the known Kanunga 1 mineralised quartz veins in an attempt to detect the western strike extension of both Lens 1 and 2.
Slightly anomalous gold values of between 20 to 40 ppb were detected in the expected strike position of both lenses for a distance of between 40 to 80 meters along strike before dropping to below detection limit (Map 3).
Map 3: Plan of Kanunga 1 Prospect showing results of Auger drill fences in tracing westerly strike of gold veins
One N-S drill fence of 8 Auger holes, spaced 10 meters apart, was completed on the eastern side of the Kanunga School Anomaly. Results indicate a cluster of anomalous values ranging between 30 ppb to 180 ppb gold and averageing 77 ppb gold over a 40 meter interval. A sample of the quartz stone layer was collect for analysis which returned 2.56 g/t gold. It is the same stone layer, located on the contact between the gramite and overlying “mbuga” and representing a transported horizon that is responsible for the anomalous gold values noted in the RAB holes to the north (Map 4).
Future work
The anomalous stone layer as well as the soil anomaly over the school requires further investigation. Once the crops have been harvested, a number of auger drill traverses are planned to test the strike towards the SW where a number of anomalous soil samples have been indicated (Map 4).

Suguti (PL3966/2006)
Previous exploration undertaken during the course of 2011, has focused mainly on the northern part of the Suguti Licence, north of the major NW trending Suguti Fault zone which bisects the the central part of the licence.
Exploration has included:
i.
Ground Magnetic survey
ii.
IP Gradient survey
iii.
Regional Soil sampling surveys on 400 meter x 50 meter grid (554 samples) .
Regolith and geological mapping. Exposure is limited to minor rock out crops on the northern side of the Suguti Fault. Granite, containing magnetite, occurs as a hill in the northern part of the license. The granite/greenstone contact is masked by coarse textured laterite consisting of laterised basaltic and quartz fragments. The underlying greenstone rocks have been intensely sheared and iron stained along to the NW-SE trending granite contact. Brick-red soils make up the NE part of the license before being masked by the overlying “mbuga” further south.
The southern part of the licence, south of the Suguti fault comprises of hills of Banded Iron Formation.
iv.
Infill soil sampling surveys on 25 meter centers along the existing soil sample traverses at Target 1 and 2, were completed during 2nd quarter 2011 (106 samples). A number of low order threshold soil anomalies, attaining a maximum of 50 ppb gold, appear to form at least three NE trending, parallel zones of up to 2.5 kilometers strike length (Target 1).
v.
Pitting.
Orientation pits were dug to determine the depth of the “mbuga” as well as to test the contact between the granite and the greenstone rocks in the northern part of the licence. A total of 14 pits were dug, and on average, the thickness of the “mbuga” varied between 0.8 to 1.20 meters (Table 2). Results are shown in Table 3 and on Map 5.

Most of the pits encountered granite and failed to intersect the greenstone lithologies whose contact is further south than expected. Consequently the samples collected were barren of gold.
vi.
Schlumberger VES survey. Five N-S profiles totaling 3.6 line-kilometers have been planned across Targets 1 and 2 (Table 4). One N-S profile of 1200 meters in length has been completed on the eastern side of Target 1. Results revealed two sets of coincident chargeability/resistivity anomalies underlying two of the 3 ENE trending soil anomalies in Target 1 (Map 5).

Termite samples
Termite sampling has been undertaken across the brown-red soils over Target 1 and in the south of the PL. A total of 89 samples have been collected and have been assayed. Results are generally poor (below detection limit). However, a single anomalous termite mound, located within the soil anomaly of Target 1, returned 70 ppb Au.
A cluster of termites were sampled close to the contact with the lower slopes of the BIF outcrop and the “mbuga” cover on the south-western side of the PL, south of the Suguti Fault. A number of anomalous termite mounds ranging from 40 to 230 ppb gold was identified (Map 5).

The auger rig, recently purchased by Lake Victoria Resources was mobolised onto the Suguti Project within the 1st quarter of 2012 in order to test the strike extend of the known soil anomalies beneath the “mbuga” cover within the Suguti Fault basin. An initial programme of some 460 holes were initially planned along a number of N-S traverses on a collar spacing (sample positions) of 20 meters apart but was increased to over 1000 holes (Phase 2). Due to cultivated fields less than 50% of the planned holes could be drilled (Table 6 , Map 6)

Due to cultivated rice paddies across the “mbuga” flats, no further drilling is possible until after the rainy season and the crops have been harvested.
Three auger holes encountered a quartz rich stone layer at the base of the Mbuga cover. The quartz fragments were submitted for 50 gm Fire assay and results are shown in Table 8 and Map 7.

Future Exploration
Since results from the auger holes drilled across the interpolated strike extensions of all three target zones failed to encounter any significant gold mineralisation beneath the mbuga, further exploration is to be focused mainly at Target 1 and 3 across the known soil anomalies. Infill soil sampling, including Auger drilling over mbuga covered areas, has been undertaken along 200 meter N-S traverse line on 10 meter sample intervals in order to define the present soil anomalies (Table - work programme). To date 157 samples (excluding 8 QA-QC samples) including 84 auger drill samples, have been collected and are pending submission to SGS laboratories Mwanza. Results will determine whether a trenching programme is warranted across the targets.
Additional auger drill sampling is planned to be undertaken over the cultivated areas once the crops (rice) have been harvested to follow up on the 200 ppb gold anomaly as well as the strike extensions of Zone 1, 2 and 3 of Target 1, where no sampling has yet been undertaken (Map 7).

Singida Gold Project
Company personnel first visited the Singida project area during March, 2009 and became aware of the high level of artisanal (small scale) gold mining that was being conducted along an estimated five (5) kilometer mineralized zone. Subsequently, on May 15, 2009, the Company signed a Mineral Financing Agreement with one director of the Company authorizing him, on behalf of the Company, to acquire Primary Mining Licenses (“PMLs”) in the Singida area. As of July 13, 2011, this director has entered into several different Mineral Properties Sales and Purchase agreements with multiple PML owners that hold title to the licenses along the mineralized zone at the Singida project area. Twenty-three (23) PML agreements were executed for an outright purchase of the PMLs and they have been completed. These twenty-three PMLs have been 100% acquired by this director in behalf of the Company. On August 9, 2011, the Company relinquished 17 PMLs. The Company also has option agreements to acquire an additional twenty (20) PMLs within a targeted area at the Singida project. Under the terms of all the agreements, if we complete all twenty (20) of the various agreements, that when combined form the Singida project area, then our total purchase consideration will be approximately $4,531,040 (TZS7,551,733,325) by February, 2013. At the option of the Company, a 2% Net Smelter Production royalty or 2% of the Net Sale Value may be substituted in place of the final payment for each PML and paid on a pro rata basis determined by the total final number of PMLs involved in a Special Mining License.
The Company commenced a Phase 2 Reverse Circulation drilling program in March 2011, centered at the Samabaru 2, 3, 4 and 5 Prospects as well as exploring a number of exploration targets within the Singida-Londoni northwest trending shear zone at Sambaru 5 and between Sambaru 3 and Sambaru 4 (Table 8) in which 92 boreholes, totalling 9,023 meters have been drilled. All boreholes, collared along northeast trending drill fences, are inclined at -50 degrees to -65 degrees either to the northeast or to the southwest. Total meters drilled in both Phase 1 (August 2010) and Phase 2 drill programmes amounts to 15,536 meters (Table 9).

The two exploration targets were investigated by drilling. The 2nd zone of mineralisation located some 180 meters south of the main mineralised zone at Sambaru 5 was intersected but was found to be narrow and of low grade running 1.04 g/t gold over 1 meter. Similarly, the +100 ppb gold soil anomaly located mid-way between Sambaru 3 and 4 returned anomalous results with only one narrow intersection of 1.57 g/t gold over 1 meter being encountered. No follow-up drilling was undertaken on either of the two targets.

Results of the drilling programme are summarised in Table 10 and Map 9.
Table 10. Summary of Reverse Circulation Drill Results from Sambaru 2, 3, 4 and 5
Sambaru 5
Drilling has intercepted the narrow and steeply-dipping, arsenopyrite-rich gold zone across a strike length of some 160 meters. Besides the high grade intersection of 16.80 g/t gold over 2 meters reported from Section 4640W during the Phase 1 drilling programme, most of the intercepts returned low gold values of between 0.5 to 1 g/t gold over 1 or 2 meter intervals with grade appearing to decrease with depth.
Sambaru 4
The main body of mineralization, having a grade of 3.45 g/t gold over a true thickness of 11 meters and centered over an area of extensive artisanal mining, was traced to a depth of 80 meters before pinching out. The zone, narrowing rapidly out along strike and decreasing in grade, has been traced for 320 meters. Drilling indicated a decrease in grade and width of the mineral zone at depth.
A subsidiary, narrow mineralized lens, located 50 meters to the north-east of the main lens was traced along a strike for 80 meters. Anomalous grades defined the zone further to the northwest.
Sambaru 3
Sambaru 3 is the 2nd largest of all 5 artisanal sites, comprising of at least 4 parallel but narrow mineralized zones that have been traced continually across a strike length of 280 meters. The main pod of mineralization, averaging 1.93 g/t gold and having a maximum width of 25 meters, pinches out at 110 meters in depth. It has a surface strike extend of approximately 40 meters.
The mineral lenses dip sub-vertically to the northeast. Drilling has indicated that a number of lenses appear to extend beyond 110 meters depth and are open along strike both to the northwest and southeast.

Sambaru 2
Sambaru 2 is the largest of all 5 prospects within the Singida-Londoni Project. Although artisanal workings extend across a strike length of 580 meters, drilling has defined the mineralization to occur within 320 meters of strike length. Four, parallel and vertically to sub-vertically dipping gold lenses, have been intersected to depths of 130 meters although in places the lenses do appear either to pinch out or decrease in grade.
The lenses tend to occur as narrow semi-discontinuous veins “pinching and swelling” along the horizontal and vertical strike with grades typically varying between 3.5g/t to less than 0.5g/t gold.
An evaluation of the total drill results of both Phase 1 and 2 drill programmes have shown that the gold mineralization at the Singida-Londoni project comprises of narrow medium to low grade and often discontinuous lenses. The shear structures hosting the gold-rich zones typically “pinch and swell” along strike, which in places, have resulted in larger pods of limited size as at Sambaru 3 and Sambaru 4.
Evaluation of the surface quartz rubble zones at both Sambaru 2 and 3 was undertaken in order to determine whether small, but easily accessible, gold deposits are present. These quartz rubble zones are considered to be due to erosional deflation of the main gold bearing zones at each of the prospects.
Mapping followed by a sampling programme of pits was undertaken on a 25 meter x 80 meter spaced grid (Table 11). A 5 kilogram bulk sample was collected by taking a vertical channel down the pit wall. The volume of the 5 kilogramme sample was maintained for all samples collected by using a measuring box.
The following determinations were made:
% of quartz fragments to soil by weight (separate <1mm and >1mm size fragments to determine the weight for each population
% of quartz fragments to soil by volume (plave the <1mm size fraction in a measured container and estimate its volume of ratio of quartz fragments to other rock fragments)
The following sample preparation was undertaken with each 5 kilogram sample:
Split <1mm soil to 500gm for BLEG (Bottle Leachable Extractable Gold) analysis)
From the >1mm size fraction of quartz fragments,, an approximately equal size quartz fragments (1 kilogram) for Laboratory crushing and 50 gm Fire analysis

Each of the quartz rubble zones were mapped prior to commencing a pitting programme on a 80 meter x 25 meter grid.
Pitting was undertaken according to the mapping and in part followed the programme outlines in Table 11. Depth of pit, to the base of the rubble zone, varied from 0.40 meters to 1.20 meters across all three rubble zones. A total of 32 pits were excavated and sampled.
Results
Each of the 5 kilogram samples was sieved to <1mm and each fraction was weighed. On weighted and volumetric average, 86% of the sample comprised of rock fragments > 1mm. The majority of rock fragments (90%) comprise of quartz fragments. Results of both the fine fraction (<1mm) and coarse fraction (>1mm) are shown in Table 12 and summarized in n Table 13 and Map 10.

Map 10. Surface plan showing position of quartz rubble zones and location of pits
Mapping has shown that the surface areas of the rubble zones cover a relatively small surface area from 6500 square meters at Sambaru 2A to 10,500 square meters at Sambaru 3 (Map 10). Furthermore, pitting has revealed thin surface deposits, that comprise mainly of quartz fragments, averaging between 0.5 to 0.75 metres in thickness. Gold grade is predominantly contained in the coarse fraction (Table 13). Sambaru 3 returned an average grade of 1.04 g/t gold whereas Sambaru 2 and 2A returned grades <0.31g/t gold.
Little potential is present to warrant further work to evaluate a resource from these surface quartz rubble zones.
An evaluation of the drill results for both Phase 1 and 2 programs has shown that gold mineralization at the Singida-Londoni project consists of narrow medium to low grade and often discontinuous lenses. The shear structures hosting the gold-rich zones typically “pinch and swell” along strike, which in places, has resulted in larger pods of limited size as at Sambaru 3 and Sambaru 4 which indicates that the gold deposits have limited potential to be developed into a major ore resource contrary to the Company’s vision of discovering substantially larger and economically viable gold deposits in the short term. In this regard, the Company believes that the nature and extent of the mineralization revealed thus far may lend itself rather towards a small-scale commercial mining operation, a joint venture or a possible sale. The Company will therefore endeavor to utilize through Joint Venture or sale the Singida assets to assist in funding its other projects.
The Company has reduced the number of PMLs that were under option from 37 to 20 PMLs and together with the remaining 23 PMLs, the mineral rights of which are under agreement with a Tanzanian company of which full ownership (100%) will be automatically transferred to Lake Victoria once a Mining Licence encompassing the PMLs is taken out.
Although the Company completed a Technical report in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 prior to the June 2010 revised code, it was not submitted. The report is now being prepared under the revised guidleines and will include both drilling campaigns undertaken on the project.
Buhemba Gold Project
The Buhemba Gold Project consists of two (2) Prospecting Licenses (PLs) that cover an area about 107km2.
1. Nyanza PL4892/2007
The Nyanza PL4892/2007 is currently under renewal application. No work was undertaken during this period.
Previously, field investigation of the work undertaken by Randgold Resources has confirmed the presence of at least 4 areas of artisanal workings. Follow-up exploration is planned to target the known areas of artisanal mining as well as to investigate the western sheared basalt/granite contact in PL4892/2007. Although the PMLs of the artisanal workings do not form part of the PL license, we believe that the owners will be amenable to entering an option agreement. Once the Minister of Mines approves the application to renew the license, a number of E-W Schlumberger profiles are planned across the sheared contact in order to prioritize target delineation with a subsequent follow-up reverse circulation (RC) drilling program shortly thereafter.
2. Mageta PL2979/2005 & PL5159/2009
A reconnaissance visit to the two, narrow E-W licences, PL2979/2005 and PL5159/2009, southeast of Buhemba town and directly south of Mageta Village, was made in the latter part of 2011. Both licences are located within granite terrain. Hills of granite outcrop along the northern part of PL 2979/2005 that forms a gently valley slope to the south where streams drain into the Ruvana River. The area is largely covered by black cotton soil (“mbuga”). No outcrops rise out from the depositional plain. Furthermore no artisanal activity appears to have ever taken place on any of the two licences (pers.comm from local inhabitants). The area is considered not prospective for gold and has been relinquished.
Kiabakari East (PL7142/2011)
The Kiabakari East Project is located approximately 55 kilometers southeast of Musoma town, in the Mara Region. The PL, covering 15.2 square kilometres and lying within the central part of the Musoma-Mara Greesntone Belt, was granted to Lake Victoria Resources (T) Ltd. by the Ministry of Mines in April 2011.
The PL was previously investigated by Randgold Resources who excavated a number of N-S trenches across a small hill, rising some 50 meters above the landscape, comprising of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) rocks in the central to southern part of the PL. They also undertook 3 N-S drill fences, totalling 24 reverse circulation drill holes, along strike to the east of the BIF hill. No information is currently available. Minor artisanal mining activities are present on the BIF hill. Recently, the eastern part of the license has been invaded by +500 artisanal miners who have exposed a NNE-SSW trending gold bearing structure hosted by a quartz porphyry dyke within a metasedimentary rock sequence.
Exploration Strategy
Landsat Images for the licence area and surrounding environs were obtained and processed. A variety of band ratio combinations have been used to extract lithology and alteration. Of importance is the recognition of structural features across the Kiabakari licence. A prominent set of NNE fractures, supported by the Total Magnetic Intensity image of the ground magnetometer survey, cut across the eastern part of the permit. The artisanal working at the Kyarano prospect are aligned along this trend (Map 11).
Map 11: Landsat Image over the Kiabakari East Prospect showing major structural trends.
BIF Hill Prospect
Detailed mapping of the BIF Hill and immediate environs were initially undertaken. The BIF is intensely folded and in places sheared. Fold axes trend NW-SE with an apparent plunge to the SE. Artisanal activity is selectively mining the quartz veinlets within the shear zones.
A number of previously dug trenches and artisanal pits were cleared of bush and selective sampling, including grab samples and 2 meter composite channel samples along the sidewall of the trenches and at the base of the pits, were collected (33 samples-Table 14).
A follow-up trench programme, in which a number of the old existing trenches as well as new trenches, totalling 342.7 meters, were re-opened, excavated and sampled. Results are summarised in Table 14 and Map 12.

Regional geological mapping and an in-house ground magnetic survey along 200 meter spaced N-S traverse lines and totalling 78.2 line-kilometers, were completed across the licence. A number of infill and repeat ground magnetic N-S traverses across the southern portion of the licence was undertaken to improve the quality of the data. A total of 20 lines amounting to 103.9 line-kilometers was completed and the data processed and imaged.
The licence is divided by the westward flowing Kyarano River which appears to flow along the contact beween the granite hills to the north and the meta-sedimentary rocks to the south which comprise mainly of argillites and BIF. A outcrop of basalt containing disseminated pyrite is noted in the NW corner of the licence, north of the Kyarano River and forms the western contact with the granite hills. Results of the rock samples are shown in Table 15.

Two linear anomalies, approximately 800 meters apart and trending northwest for a strike length of some 2 kilometers occur across low topographic hills in the central to southern part of the licence. The northern trend encompasses the BIF hill. Furthermore, a similar geochemical anomaly is seen to exist in the eastern side of the licence where some 500 artisanal miners have been active.
Soil Sampling
A regional soil sampling programme on a 200 meter x 50 meter grid has been completed across the central and southern part of the licence, south of the granite outcrops that constitute the northern part of the licence. A total of 801 soil samples were collected and together with 5% QA-QC samples constituting a Commercial Standard and a Blank totalling 43 samples, were submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for gold analysis by Aqua Regia.

Both the BIF hill and the Kyarano artisanal site, located in the central and eastern part of the permit respectively, are clearly shown by subtle but distinct gold-in-soil anomalies (Map 13). At BIF Hill the soil anomaly extends to the southeast for some 1500 meters. Gold mineralisation at the Kyarano Prospect is hosted by a NNE trending, altered quartz porphyry dyke. Soil sampling has doubled the present strike of the mineralised zone, as defined by the artisanal shafts, to at least 800 meters in length before being covered by duricrust to the south.
Soil sampling has also revealed a linear soil anomaly, trending from the Kyarano Prospect 2.6 kilometers to the NW and some 400 meters north of BIF Hill. Furthermore, a NNE trending soil anomaly of up to 600 meters in strike length, similar to that reflected over the Kyarano Prospect, is located 800 meters east of BIF Hill (Map 13).

I P Survey
A Gradient array IP survey was undertaken, on a 200 meter spaced N-S grid, across the central part of the Kiabakari East Permit. Problems were encountered in the northern part of the grid to obtain reliable readings due to the westward flowing Kyarano River.
Schlumberger Survey
Schlumberger VES N-S and E-W profiles were undertaken across BIF Hill and the artisanal workings at the Kyarano Prospect respectively (Table 18, Map 14).

KYARANO PROSPECT
Inconsistent IP results were noted from the surveys undertaken across the Kyarano workings which failed to distinguish the pyritised quartz porphyry rock.
A distinct chargeability with low resistivity, situated some 100m north of the interpolated strike extensions of the mineralised BIF unit, was noted from a number of N-S Schlumberger profiles undertaken across BIF Hill.
Kyarano Prospect
The Kyarano Prospect, located on the eastern side of the Kiabakari East licence, is a recent and active artisanal site in which up to +500 illegal miners have been present. Shafts, aligned along a NNE trend, were sunk into a quartz porphyry/felsite “dyke” rock, for a strike distance of some 400 meters. Mining activities decreased as flooding of the shafts occurred from 15-20 meters below ground. A number of the shafts were sampled and assayed for gold by 50 gm fire assay, results of which are shown in Table 19 and Map 14.

Diamond drilling
A diamond drill programme, amounting to approximately 1000 meters to test both BIF Hill and the Kyarano prospects is currently in progress (Table 20, Map 14). Drilling has commenced at BIF Hill with an inclined hole of -50 degrees to the north being drilled beneath the hill. This will be followed by a number of inclined boreholes collared on 40 meter-spaced N-S sections at the base of the hill in order to define the geometry of the interpolated plunging ore shoot which is hosted by banded iron formation lithologies comprising of chert, siltstones and greywackes.
Table 20. Diamond drill programme planned at Kaiabakari East
A short drilling programme has been planned to test the NNE trending pyritic quartz felsite porphyry at the Kyarano Prospect located on the eastern side of the project area some 1.5 kilometers east of BIF Hill. Two boreholes, collared 240 meters apart on E-W drill fences will test the area 80 meters beneath the active artisanal workings in order to examine the hosting lithologies and alteration associated with this known gold mineralisation.
KED001 intersected a 110 meter wide zone of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) comprising of cyclic sequences of cherts, siltsones and greywackes. Interbedded layers of massive, as well as dessiminated sulphides, predominantly pyrrhotite, occur throughout the rock sequence. The footwall rocks to the BIF units at 110 meters down hole comprise of conglomerates and sediment supported breccias in which “pebbles” of pyrrhotite are commonly observed.
All the core will be cut in half by a rock saw with the half core (or quarter core if over wider intervals of >1 meter) being sampled according to the intervals as per geologic log. Strict quality control will be maintained in which 5% of the sample batch, comprising 20 samples, will contain a blank, a Commercial Standard and a duplicate. The sample batches will be submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for 50gm Fire assay.
Future exploration
Once the Diamond drilling programme has been completed, the following field exploration is planned:
Repeat and infill sampling on 50 meter x 25 meter grids are planned to validate and define the current soil anomalies. Previous termite sampling to the south of BIF Hill and the Kyarano Prospect which returned anomalous values but were not reflected in the surrounding soils, are to be further investigated by pitting in order to determine the validity of the gold values derived from the termite mounds.
A Reverse circulation drill programme will be planned, pending the success of the diamond drill programme, later in the year.
Uyowa Gold Project
The Uyowa Gold project, located 120 kilometers northwest of Tabora town, consists of seven (7) Prospecting Licenses (PLs) that initially cover a total area of 720 square kilometers in the west-central area of Tanzania. Exploration has been mainly focused in the northern license blocks PL 3425/2007 and PL5153/2008.
Exploration Strategy
Initially, exploration work on PL 3425/2007 commenced in the 1st quarter of 2011 and continued until the onset of the rainy season in early May. Field work re-commenced in the last week of July. Prior to the rainy season, the following exploration activities were undertaken:
The raw aeromagnetic data, flown by Geosurvey International G.m.b.H between 1977 to 1980 on a line spacing of 1.0km and at a height of 120m, was purchased from the Geological Survey, Dodoma and has been subsequently reprocessed and interpreted. A number of priority areas were highlighted from Targets 1 to 5 (Map 15). Due to accessibility, exploration has been focused on Target 3 which lies across the central and eastern side of the License Block and includes PL 5916/2009.
Map 15: Regional aeromagnetic map across Uyowa Project area showing exploration targets numbered according to priority.
Detailed ground magnetometer survey has been partly undertaken across Target 3 on 200 meter space N-S traverse lines. To date, at total of 35 traverses of 7.5 kilometer each, totaling 265 line-kilometers have been completed along the eastern part of Target 3.
Soil sampling on 400 meter x 50 meter centers has been undertaken. A total of 2,616 samples of 1 kilogram each, including 53 Blanks and 9 Standards, have been collected, prepared on site to 80 meshes. A select consignment of 1182 samples including the QA-QC samples were submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for gold determination by Aqua Regia. The remaining 1434 samples have been stored at site for possible later submission to the laboratory.
Results indicate that 81% of all samples returned below background values (<10 ppb Au) Table 21. All of the anomalous values (>50ppb Au) tend to be isolated single point values. The maximum soil value reported is 1.24g/t Au.

Regolith mapping has been undertaken in conjunction with the soil sampling program across Target 3.
Remote sensing studies have been undertaken using various Band ratios with Landsat Imagery. ASTER imaging has been obtained for the area and has been processed using the various mineral Index ratios. Follow-up ground truthing of the Fe ratios have partly been undertaken and have confirmed the presence of laterite in PL 3425/2005.
Proceeding the rainy season, the exploration focus was shifted to the the northern most licence (PL 5153/2008) where an active artisanal mining site, covering an area of 300 meters x 100 meters, is present. The area of workings and the surrounding environs are covered by 15 PMLs that do not form part of the PL. The Company has entered into an Option agreement with the owners of 4 PMLs that lie across the main zone of workings.
By the time exploration commenced a gold rush of some 5000 artisanal miners, had invaded the site and extended the E-W strike of the known workings up to 1200 meters.
The area was previously investigated by Ashanti Gold in 2003, in which they undertook 999 meters of Reverse Circulation drilling on 100 meter-spaced NNE-SSW drill fences. They intersected 4 narrow zones of gold mineralization along an E-W strike of some 300 meters which returned a number of significant intersections including of 27.16 g/t gold over 4 meters and (Table 22, Map 16).

Exploration was focused on PL 5153/2007 in which the following programmes were carried out (Map 17)
Regional Mag survey on 200 meter spaced N-S lines covering a 12 kilometers x 6 Kilometers grid
Gradient array survey on 400 meter spaced N-S lines across the optioned PML and extending out along strike across a grid of 10 kilometers x 4 kilometers

Licence reduction
Many of the licences in the Uyowa project were due for renewal during 2011 and according to Governmnet mining policy, 50% of the areas were relinquished, thereby, reducing the total land package from 729.73 square kilometers to 421.75 square kilometers (Map 18).
Both the eastern and western parts of the PL 5153/2008, largely overlain by the northward and southward flowing Igombe and Gombe Rivers respectively, were relinquished. Subsequent to the relinquishment, the Company has placed an application for the eastern part of the shed-off area since it appears from Landsat imagery that the ENE structural trend is persistent east of the river.
Map 18: Current licence distribution of the Uyowa Project
Exploration was immediately focused on mapping in detail the zone of artisanal workings as well as evaluating the mineralization being exposed by the artisanal miners. A number of shafts were selectively chosen on approximately 80 meters spaced centers along the trend in order to coincide with the planned N-S drilling grid. A total of 25 shafts and pits were channel sampled across the working face at depths of between 5 to 22 meters. Samples were collected across the narrow mineralised vein, which ranged between 10 to 35 centimeters wide, as well as hanging and footwall zones. Samples were submitted to SGS Laboratory, Mwanza for 50 gm Fire analysis. Mapping indicated a narrow, high grade quartz-rich gold bearing zone containing disseminated pyrite, striking ENE and dipping steeply to the north, beneath a 10 meter thick sand and lateritic duricrust cover.
Assay results indicate that anomalous gold grades extend into the wall rocks. The mineralised zone dips steeply to the north. A summary of the more significant results taken across the strike of mineralised zone, within the artisanal shafts, is presented in Table 23.

Ground Magnetic Survey
In-house ground magnetic survey was conducted along 200 meter spaced N-S traverses across the central part of PL 5153/2008, covering a total area of 75 square kilometers. The ground magnetic signature reflects a large isoclinal EW trending fold, whose northern limb is coincident with the trend of the known gold mineralization as shown on Map 19.
Gold mineralization is co-incident with a prominent magnetic structure that appears to define the northern limb of an E-W trending fold zone. Gold mineralization is related to narrow and intensely silicified shear zones containing disseminated pyrite mineralization. A N-S graben structure on the western end of the trend coincides with the last of the artisanal workings. This area, unlike the artisanal site where laterite is often exposed on surface, is overlain by sand cover for some 500 metres to the west before lateritic soils are again present suggesting possible continuation of the mineralised trend further westwards.
Map 19: TMI map over the artisanal area and environs.
IP Gradient Survey
An in-house gradient IP survey, covering 40 square kilometers, was partly completed across the artisanal workings and surrounding environs. The area was divided into 28 blocks of 1.1 kilometer x 2 kilometer with a N-S line spacing of 200 meters. A total of 16 survey blocks, amounting to 145 line-kilometers, was completed by the end of the year (Map 20).
Results, together with the ground magnetic survey, mapping and soil geochemistry, is expected to refine and improve the structural interpretations and target definition across the project area.
Schlumberger VES orientation, N-S profiles of 300 meters in length were undertaken across the zone of artisanal workings in order to test and define the mineralised zone before applying the method to trace the mineralisation along strike as well as testing a number of ground magnetic targets (Table 24). A total of 12 N-S profiles, amounting to 3.60 line-kilometers, of the 24 planned profiles were completed. Results of the orientation survey across the artisanal mining site indicated that a number of profiles reflected coincident chargeability/resistivity anomalies over the known mineralization.
Map 20: Map showing completed Gradient IP survey blocks
Table 24. Schlumberger Survey
A number of Schlumberger profiles were undertaken along the interpreted northern “limb” of the E-W trending antiform towards the apparent fold closure in the eastern side of the PL. Results revealed a number of coincident chargeability and resistivity anomalies across the “limb” of the fold.
Regolith and Geological mapping
The area, characterized by gentle undulating plains at an altitude of 1100 meters above sea level, is mainly flat and covered by black cotton (“mbuga”) and lateritic soils in which occasional inselbergs comprising of K-feldspathic-rich granitic gneisses occur on the southern part of the licence. The superficial cover is up to +8 meters thick. Three main categories of regolithic are noted:
Cuirasse (pisolitic and conglomeratic),
depositional sand cover
residual sand cover
The underlying geology of PL5153/2008 consists essentially of granitic biotite and pegmatite gneisses. Regional mapping of the granitic gneiss outcrops in the southern part of the licence indicate the presence of sinsitral NW-SE faults zones. These faults may have a controlling influence where they cross the ENE-SWS gold bearing shear zone to the north (Map 19) as is seen by the improved gold grades and widths in the western part of the artisanal mining area.
Soil and termitaria sampling
Soil sampling has been undertaken over the red-brown lateritic soils on a 200 meter x 50 meter N-S grid. A total of 1557 samples of 1 kilogram each have been collected, prepared on site to 80 mesh and submitted together with 5% Blanks and Standards (56 samples), to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for gold and arsenic determination by Aqua Regia in ppb and ppm levels respectively. The remaining samples were collected largely over sand cover and will be retained for possible later submission if warranted by further mapping.
Results indicate that 93% of all samples returned gold values below 10 ppb. No arsenic is present, with all sample values being below detection limit (<20 ppm), refer to Table 25. All the anomalous gold values occur as single point values along the known E-W zone of gold mineralization. A single maximum value of 400 ppb gold occurs on the far eastern side of the trend (Map 21).

Map 21: Soil geochemistry map showing main anomalous gold trends
Termitaria sampling has been focused in testing the underlying geochemistry of the various ground magnetic and structural targets. A total of 279 termite mounds of intermediate to cathedral sizes have been sampled and approximately 1 kilogram of sample has been panned at site. Results are generally disappointing with only a few termites returning a single nugget of gold. A number of large termites exist on the artisanal workings and these also failed to return any gold. It is believed that the near surface water table level coupled with sand cover as well as the laterite duricrust has restricted the use of termite mounds as a geochemical sampling method in this district.
RC Drilling
A Reverse Circulation drill programme was executed during September and October 2011. A total of 2,486 meters of drilling was completed in 29 boreholes. Drilling was aimed at testing the strike extensions of the known mineralised gold zone beneath the area of intensive artisanal activity as well as to test a number of geophysical targets that have been defined from the recent ground magnetometer and IP Schlumberger surveys.
Drilling was conducted along 80 meter spaced N-S fences across a strike length of 1,300 meters with all boreholes angled between 50-65 degrees to the south.
Drilling identified a number of narrow and anomalous gold bearing zones in which a single continuous gold bearing silicified shear zone, having a grade greater than 0.5g/t gold, over +1 meter interval, is persistent throughout the area being tested. Gold mineralization occurs as free gold as well as in association with pyrite mineralization. Drill samples were collected across the gold bearing zones on 1 meter intervals with the results consequently representing a diluted grade to those higher grade assays that are present over narrow widths within the artisanal shafts (Table 23).
Unlike the central and eastern part of the Prospect, which is represented by a single mineralised structure, the western part comprises of at least 4 mineralised veins that generally, not only have increased widths, but, from the results received to date, also reflect substantially higher gold grades, across a strike length of some 300 meters and to a vertical depth of 60 meters below surface (Table 26, Map 22).
Table 26. Summary of reverse circulation drill results
*lateritic duricrust
Boreholes URC013 to URC018 were drilled in the western part of the prospect.
Map 22: Borehole collar plan showing gold intercepts along the mineralised zone
A single drill hole, collared 400 meters to the east of the artisanal workings, targeted the interpolated position along strike of the mineralised shear zone. A number of zones of pyrite mineralization and associated silicification with quartz veining and minor visible gold were noted down-hole indicating the persistence of the mineralised shear zone for at least some 1700 meters along strike. Assay results returned 1meter intercepts of 0.61g/t gold, 0.63 g/t gold and 0.46 g/t gold at 61 meters, 96 meters and 100 meters down-hole respectively.
Two boreholes were drilled to test two ground magnetic targets:
i. Ground magnetic survey indicates that the gold mineralization occurs along the northern limb of an E-W trending antiform that appears to close toward the east (Map 19). Schlumberger profiling has revealed a number of coincident chargeability and resistivity anomalies across the “limb” of the fold. A single borehole was drilled, 3.36 kilometers east from the artisanal workings, to test the magnetic signature and IP Schlumberger anomalies along the fold arc. The area is overlain by red lateritic soils. Drilling intersected a number of zones of increased magnetite alteration down-hole. No pyrite or intense silicification was noted and in effect the borehole failed to intersect any mineralisation.
ii. The second borehole was drilled to test a similar ground magnetic signature that is present within the “inner” core of the fold zone 1.20 kilometers to the south of the artisanal workings and within the NW-SE structural corridor that defines the higher grade portion of the mineralised zone to the north (Map 19). Although the borehole did intersect an anomalous 4 meter zone of disseminated pyrite mineralization overlying a zone of magnetite-rich granitic gneiss, no anomalous gold grade was revealed from the assay results.
This first round of drilling has successfully tested the continuity and persistence of the mineralised shear zone along some 1,700 meters of strike and to a depth of upto 60 meters below surface. The potential of the zone, besides being open-ended along strike and open down-dip, is to be focused in the western part of the trend where increased gold grades and widths have been intersected. Regional mapping of granitic gneiss outcrops to the south-east of the zone indicate the presence of NW-SE faults zones that may well have a controlling influence on the emplacement of the gold mineralization. Such features are important structural controls for other gold deposits elsewhere in the Lake Victoria Gold Belt.
Diamond drilling
The 1500 meter diamond drill programme, primarily aimed at defining and understanding the structural controls of the 4 gold veins across 300 meters of strike length within the central to western parts of the 1700 meter long E-W shear zone, was undertaken from March to May 2012. The drilling, planned on 40 metre spaced N-S sections, also tested the down-dip extensions of mineralization to a vertical depth of some 150 meters. A total of 1459 meters was drilled in 11 boreholes (Table 27, Map 23).
Table 27. Diamond drill programme
Map 23: Diamond drill collar plan
Drilling has revealed that the gold mineralization is hosted by a number of semi-continuous ductile shears zones of up to 7 meters wide and containing disseminated pyrite mineralization, dipping between 55 to 70 degrees to the north. In all sections, the mineralised gold zones have been traced to vertical depths of 100 meters and are open at depth.
A “twin” hole was drilled to compare the gold grades and widths in order to increase gold grade confidence of the previous RC drilling results and to work towards establishing a gold resource.
A single diamond drill hole was drilled at either end of the known mineralised zone, confirming the presence of the mineralised shear zone continuing out along strike both to the east and to the west.
All borehole samples across the mineralised zones have been split, sampled and submitted to SGS Laboratories Mwanza for 50 gm Fire assay. Strict quality control was maintained with 5% of each of the sample batches having a blank, duplicate and commercial standard inserted as part of the sample stream. Results are pending.

PL5153/2008
Interpretation of the ground magnetic survey suggests the presence of a graben structure that coincides with the last of the artisanal workings on the western side of known mineralised zone. The area, unlike the artisanal site where laterite is often exposed on surface, is overlain by sand cover for some 500 meters to the west before lateritic soils are again present suggesting possible continuation of the mineralised trend further to the west. Landsat imagery clearly shows area of laterite and lateritic soil over the area. Based on the recent soil geochemistry results, follow up specific soil sampling is planned across the interpolated trend of gold mineralization to both the west and east of the artisanal workings covering a total strike length of 3.5 kilometers as shown in Map 24.
Conventional soil sampling is planned across areas of lateritic soil cover. Initially a RAB programme had been recommended to test the intervening areas covered by black cotton soil (“mbuga’). However, prior to embarking on such a programme, an orientation survey using enzyme geochemistry has been recommended as a trial study over a portion of the area to be sampled. Should results be positive further sampling incorporating this geochemical method will continue to be used to outline the gold anomaly?
Follow-up investigation using possibly both methods of soil sampling will be undertaken across a number of ground magnetic targets (Map 19) in order to prioritise targets for later testing by RAB drilling.
Reverse Circulation drilling has been planned to undertake infill drilling on 40 meters spaced N-S sections across the artisanal site in order to undertake a resource calculation. Furthermore, part of the programme will also focus on testing the soil anomaly along strike.
RAB programme is planned to test a number of magnetic targets as indicated in Map 19.

Handeni Gold Project
The Handeni Project, comprising of three (3) Prospecting Licenses and covering a total area of 200.59 square kilometers (Table 28), is located approximately 240 kilometers by road north-west of Dar es Salaam and some 30 kilometers south of Handeni town within the Handeni District (Map 25). The Company has acquired 100% of the mineral rights for PL7148/2011 as well as entering into an “option-to-purchase” agreement for 100% of PL7002/2001 and PL4816/2807 (Table 28).
Table 28. Details of Handeni Region Prospecting Licenses
Map 25: Location map of the Handeni Project showing the PLs in red.
Gold was discovered in 2003 centered around the Magambazi village. However, the area has recently come into the spotlight as a possible new gold district. High grade gold intersections are being reported by Canaco Resources from their drilling programs that are being conducted on their 197 square kilometer Kilindi PL located immediately west of the Company PLs (Map 26) .
The area, situated outside the known boundary of the Tanzanian Craton, has long been overlooked as a major exploration target due primarily to the nature of the high grade metamorphic rocks not being considered suitable to host major gold deposits. Increased attention is now being paid to this area that is situated between the known Tanzanian Craton and the Proterozoic Mozambique Mobile Belt.
The geology of the region is represented by high grade metamorphic rocks within the amphibolite to granulite facies comprising of feldspar-quartz-biotite and garnet-hornblende-biotite gneisses and pegmatites aligned along a regional northwest-southeast trend. The host lithologies for gold mineralisation as reported by Canaco Resources comprise of garnet-silica altered amphibolite together with minor biotite-kyanite-quartz-feldspar gneisses. Folding, with fold axes aligned along the regional structure are evident at Magambazi, where they form, in conjunction with the favourable mafic lithologies, the primary controls to the gold mineralisation.
Exploration Strategy
Prior to commencing fieldwork, the following desktop studies were undertaken:
Structural interpretation of the regional government aeromagnetic data across the area
Landsat interpretation using the various mineral indexes and alteration ratios.
Stream sediment sampling and follow-up, select soil sampling programmes were undertaken on the Handeni licenses in order to evaluate the potential of the licenses under option as swiftly as possible (Table 29)

The dominant drainage patterns are from the north-west to the south-east and are generally defined along major lithological contacts particularly between units of amphibolite and quartz-feldspar gneiss. The Mligazi River, transecting the SW corner of Mkulima PL4816/2007 and the Kwale River draining the Amani PL7002/2011 are the main river systems that drain both license areas. Secondary tributaries are developed along the NE-SW cross-cutting structures. Regional stream sediment sampling is in progress on 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th order tributaries as planned from the 1:50,000 scale topography maps (Map 26).
Map 26: Stream Sediment Sampling Program for Handeni Region Prospecting Licenses
Mkulima PL 4816/2007 & Mkulima East PL7148/2011
Stream sediment sampling and mapping of the drainages have been undertaken across the adjoining licences. Samples were collected above the confluences of streams from the gravel layer whenever possible, sieved to 1millimeter in the field and bagged as two x 500 gram samples - one of the samples to be panned at site for visible gold and the other sample being submitted to SGS Laboratory, Mwanza to test for bottle-leachable-extractable gold (BLEG).
Based on the first round of pan results, a number of areas within the PLs were selected for follow-up stream sediment sampling. Selective soil sampling was undertaken across prospective lithologies of amphibolite gneiss.
A total of 198 stream sediment samples were collected from both the Mkulima and Mkulima East Licences, results of which are shown in Table 30.

Two main targets (Targets 1 and 1a) were identified on Mkulima PL 4816/2008 (Map 27). Selective soil sampling traverses were undertaken across the targets but results were mostly below detection (<10 ppb Au) as reported in the 3rd Quarterly report. The Licence was relinquished and returned to the owner at the end of the 3 month option period.

One target (Target 2) was identified to the east on the adjoining Mkulima East PL 7148/2011. Results of the stream sediment sampling programme indicated gold-in-streams draining to the west off a small NW-SE trending ridge in the central part of the licence (Map 27). Old artisanal working was noted on the western hill slope in which outcrops of garnet-kyanite- biotite and amphibolite gneisses occur. A follow-up 200 metre x 25 metre E-W soil sample grid (Map 28), in which 170 soil samples, including 8 QA-QC samples, were submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for Aqua Regia analysis.

A further infill soil sampling programme on 100 meter x 25 meter grid is recommended across the hill (188 samples) in order to better define the apparent gold anomalies prior to planning a trenching programme across the main anomalous zones. Should a trenching programme be warranted, further soil sampling on 100 meter x 50 meter grid is proposed around the hill on 200 meter x 50 meter grid (623 samples) to increase the area of investigation and strike extend of the gold anomalies (Table 33 , Map 28).

Amani PL 7002/2011
The Prospecting Licence (PL), covering an area of 170 square kilometers, is located 32 kilometers southeast of Handeni town and 5 kilometers northeast of the Mkata junction which lies on the main tar road to Tanga. The Magambazi gold occurrence of Canaco is situated 26 kilometers due west of the licence (Map 29).
Map 29: Location of the Amani PL 2007/2011 in relation to the Magambazi project of Canaco Resources and other junior mining companies in the Handeni district. The amphibolite units are shown as having high magnetic susceptibility (red) in the TMI image and the structural interpretation in blue lines with the low angle thrust belts in black.
The licence is underlain by alternating lithologies of amphibolites, biotite-garnet-amphibolite gneisses and quartz-feldspar and pegmatatic gneisses striking NW-SE. Low angle reverse thrusts trending NNW-SSW to N-S are noted in the central and western parts of the licence (Map 29). These thrust planes are considered to be related to the Proterozic Mozambique Mobile Belt that becomes increasingly evident towards the SE. Streams, often defining lithological contacts, drain the area to the southeast.
Garnet-silica altered amphibolite with biotite-kyanite-quartz feldspar genisses are the main host lithologies together with the associated sulphides of arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite in the vein-related mineralisation at Magambazi as reported by Canaco Resources.
The only know active artisanal site on the Amani Property is located in the SW corner of the licence where alluvial gold workings occur along the Suwa River. Although isolated artisanal test pits are noted particularly in the headwaters of many of the streams, no extensive artisanals workings are present suggesting that little to no gold was found in the drainages to warrant further work by local miners.
Exploration Strategy
Stream sediment sampling has been undertaken across the whole of the licence. At least 5 target areas were outlined from the anomalous gold-in-streams for follow up soil sampling and mapping (Map 30) .
Map 30: Stream sediment and soil targets on the Amani Licence
Soil sampling has been undertaken across selective grids (Map 31). A total of 342 stream sediment and 1221 soil samples have been collected and panned, the results of which are indicated in Table 34 and Map 31.

Generally the results of the stream sediment sampling returned no visible gold in the panned sample and low assay values. The best gold values were reported from streams draining northwards and close to the northern boundary of the licence where gold values ranged between 60 and 110 ppb gold. Although one soil sample did reflect a value of 2.45ppm gold at Target 5 (Map 30), it is considered to have been a QA-QC Standard that had been mistakenly included in the sample results. A number of high grade soil values were returned from Target 1.
Soil sampling Programme
Selective soil sample traverses were completed over prospective amphibolite/granitic gneiss contacts as well as over topographically higher areas in which stream sediment sampling returned anomalous gold values.
Four separate soil sampling programmes were undertaken at various locations on the property.
Phase 1
N-S soil sampling traverses were planned and executed by the project geologist across high magnetic targets as reflected by the regional aeromagnetic signature of the area (Map 29). Five areas were soil sampled (Map 30):
The amphibolite/granitic gneiss contact in the northern part of the licence (Target 1)
The ridge in the western part of the prospect (Target 2)
East of Target 2
Target 3 and a N-S traverse east of the camp
Target 4
Target 5
Target 1
A total of 210 samples were collected and sieved to 1mm. A 500gm sample was submitted to SGS laboratory for 500gm BLEG analysis for gold and arsenic.
Soil sample results were, on the whole, spectacular with values attaining a maximum of 6.3 g/t gold as shown in Table 35 and Map 32.
Table 35. Summary of higher grade gold values from 1st Phase of soil sampling
Map 32: Soil geochemistry map of the 1st phase of sampling undertaken at Targets 1, 2, 3 and 4.
At Target 1, three linear, WNW trending soil anomalies, having an overall strike of 2.4 kilometres, occur on the southern slope of the ampholite ridge. The anomalies, paralleling the structural foliation of the amphibolite, lie proximal to the contact with quartz-feldspar gneisses to the south.
Similar high values were returned from Target 4 in the SW part of the property.
Target 2, 4 and 5
A number of soil sampling traverses were undertaken across Targets 2, 4 and 5 in the western and southwestern parts of the property. Eight E-W traverses were undertaken across the N-S watershed at Target 2. The area is underlain by garnet-amphibolite gneiss. A NW traverse was also sampled across the spur that separates two 2nd order tributaries of the Suwa River along which current alluvial workings occur further downstream.
A single N-S soil sampling traverse line of 600 meters in length was completed east of the camp in the central part of the property and south of Target 3. Two short N-S soil sampling lines were also completed in the southern part of the property, immediately east of the village of Mazingara through which passes the main Mgata-Handeni all-weather dirt road. A total of 231 samples were collected on 50 meter centers along each of the traverse lines.
Results are summarized in Table 36. The results of Target 2 were generally low with no gold value exceeding 20 ppb gold other than a single soil sample collected on the topographic divide that returned 106 ppb gold (Map 32).
The two samples that returned 3.0 and 4.35 g/t gold occur as isolated values along each of the two traverse lines at Target 5, located east of Mazingara in the southern part of the property.
Table 36. Summary of gold values returned from soil sampling across Target 2
Phase 2
The area was visited in order to validate the high grade soil samples by resampling a number of selected anomalous gold sample positions in the field at Target 1 and 4. The repeat sample was collected from a 30-40 centimeter deep sample pit dug adjacent to the original sample position. The collection of each of the soil samples was carefully monitored and the bags were sealed at site before being transported in grain sacks back to the camp. The samples were submitted to SGS for Aqua Regia analysis of gold.
All soil samples gave low gold values with no correlation to the previous results of soil samples as shown in Table 36. No repeat analysis of the sample batch was possible since the total sample had been used in the Bottle roll.
Phase 3
It was decided to re-sample the entire amphibolite ridge at Target 1 utilising a different geological crew in order to ascertain for certain whether a soil anomaly did exist within the seemingly prospective amphibolite rocks. A total of 230 samples, including 32 QA-QC samples, collected along 200 metres spaced N-S and E-W grid lines at a sample interval of 50 meters, were undertaken across the quartz-feldspar gneiss and amphibolite ridge (Map 33). Approximately 4 kilometers of strike length were covered by the survey. All soil samples were sieved to 180 micron and submitted to SGS laboratories Mwanza for Aqua Regia analysis for ppb level gold as well as arsenic determinations.
Results
Results are summarized in Table 37 in which the maximum value reported is 73 ppb Au. No arsenic is reported in any of the samples. Arsenic is an important sulphide associated with the known gold occurrences in the area.

Map 33. Results of Phase 3 and 4 soil and rock sampling undertaken across the Amani licence.
Phase 4
The area in the SW part of the licence (Target 2) in which artisanal mining is currently active along the Suwa stream was re-investigated. Previous soil sampling during Phase 1 across the ridges and hills that make up the headwaters of the stream returned a number of isolated anomalous gold values (Map 30). A follow-up soil sampling programme, was undertaken on a number of 200 meter spaced, E-W soil sampling traverses at a sample interval of 50 meters. The objective of the soil sampling programme was to detect the source of the gold being found downstream.
Initial results from Phase 1 sampling programme indicated the possibility of gold being released into the streams from a NNE trending narrow topographic spur. The area was subsequently re-sampled with no repeatability of the previous soil sample results being noted. The results of all the samples collected from the E-W traverses across the garnet-amphibolite watershed to the north also returned no anomalous gold values (Map 33).
Mapping of target 1 and 2 were undertaken as part of the reconnaissance investigation across the property. A few shallow artisanal pits were noted on the amphibolite ridge at Target 1 (412470E/9369742N) exposing foliated silicified garnet-amphibole gneiss. A number of rock samples were collected across the ridge and submitted for 50gram Fire analysis to SGS Laboratory, Mwanza. Similarly, a number of rock samples were collected across the soil sample traverse at Target 2 of the foliated quartz-biotite-garnet gneiss. No pyrite or arsenopyrite was noted in any of the outcrops although possible pyrrhotite may be locally present.
All the rock samples returned low gold values (Table 38).

The initial, encouraging results obtained from Phase 1 soil sampling were found to be false. It is not known whether the samples were tampered with at site (salted) or whether there was a serious error/mix-up at the laboratory. A number of rock samples of the garnet-amphibolite gneiss, collected across the ridge returned no gold values suggesting that the unit is not as prospective, based on similar lithologies reported by Canaco Resources to the Magambazi gold project, as previously considered.
The results of the follow-up soil sampling survey (Phase 2 and 3) indicated that no gold anomaly exists across this lithology other than a number of isolated low values not exceeding 73ppb gold. Similarly, no gold anomalies were defined in Targets 2, 3 and 4. No gold was reported from any of the rock samples collected from outcrop.
The source of the gold being won from the Suwa Stream in the SW corner of the property could not be found. It is concluded that the gold may have originated from streams emanating west of the licence boundary.
No arsenic anomalies, which appears to be ubiquitous with gold mineralization in the Handeni region, as reported by Canaco Resources, Brookemonde Capital et al., were associated with any of the soil samples collected. This suggests that no significant gold system is present over any of the areas investigated.
No further work is warranted on the licences and the property has subsequently been returned to the licence owner.
North Mara Gold Projects
The North Mara Gold Project, comprising of 10 Prospecting licences and covering 585.07 square kilometers, have been divided into 3 blocks, namely the Tarime, Nyabigena and the Kubiasi Kiserya project areas which includes the Kiagata Project. A recent addition to the North Mara Gold project is the Maji Moto licence (HQ-P23869), located 28 kilometers to the SW of the African Barrick, North Mara Gold mine. Kiagata Project (PL 4225/2006)
The Kiagata project, located within the North Mara Greestone belt, is situated in the Musoma District and is about 30 kilometers from Musoma Town, the main commercial hub in the area. The project is located immediately south of the Mara river and west of the Serengeti National Park.
A reconnaissance survey involving mapping, termite sampling, and selected soil and rock sampling were carried out during the quarter.
No historical or artisanal gold workings are present on the licence.
The area is underlain by granitic rocks that form large granitic hills that cover most of the licence. The central part of the licence is overlain by alluvial gravels and black cotton clays (“mbuga’). Laterite is commonly present at the base of the granitic hills. No greenstone rocks are present on the licence other than minor diorite float noted in the southern part of the licence (Map 34). A number of thin east-west barren quartz veins are noted within the granite.
Map 34. Geology map of Kiagata PL 4225/2006
A select number of N-S soil sampling traverses on a 400 meter x 50 meter grid was undertaken across potential targets in the southern part of the licence where red soils, quartz and diorite fragments were noted. A total of 13 soil samples were submitted for Aqua Regia analysis of gold at SGS Laboratory, Mwanza.
Termite sampling was undertaken across non-“mbuga” areas in which 9 samples were submitted for 500 gm Bleg analysis. Five rock samples of quartz veins were analysed by Fire assay. Results are summarized in Table 39.

The licence is underlain by granitic rocks. Sampling of possible tagets has indicated that no gold is present. No further work is warranted and the licence is recommended to be relinquished.
Kubiasi Kiserya (PL4833/2007)
The Kiserya project is located in northeastern Tanzania approximately 18 kilometers southeast from African Barrick’s North Mara Gold Mine, within the N Mara Gold Belt. The licence lies adjacent to the Mara River and to the north of the Serengeti Game Reserve. The northern and western parts of the licence are underlain by greenstone rocks that tend to crop out as a series of large hills that dot the surrounding plains. The remainder of the licence is underlain by granite. Little to no colluvium of black clay “mbuga” is present.
The southeast corner of the licence lies within the Serengeti National park but since mining activities are banned, this area has subsequently been relinquished. A single PML is currently under application for the last 3 years in the central to western part of the licence but, as yet, has not been granted to the Tanzanian national.
An old colonial shaft occurs in the northern part of the PL. Within the centre of the licence, recent artisanal mining has explored an outcropping, vertical dipping, auriferous quartz vein which returned a grade of 8.17 g/t gold over 0.5 meter and 4.58g/t gold across 1 meter in the hanging wall rocks. The quartz vein, exhibiting a “pinch and swell” structure, appears to swing from a strike of 055o in the north and continues in an E-W direction across a strike length of +200 meters. Both sites are hosted by sheared granitic rocks. Additional quartz vein with associated disseminated sulphide mineralisation have been noted in the eastern and southern parts of the licence.
Soil sampling with regional mapping has been completed along a 200 meter x 50 meter N-S grid during the latter part of 2010, but, only samples on 400 meter line spacing have been analysed. Select infilling soil samples on 200 meter x 50 meter line spacing were later carried out. A total 1349 soil samples were collected of which 750 samples were selected and analysed by SGS Laboratory, Mwanza (Table 40). At least 4 regional, low level soil anomalies, having overall strike lengths of between 3 to 4 kilometers and trending ENE were originally outlined but infill sampling refined these targets to 6 smaller anomalies (Map 35). Basically 5 of the anomalies are hosted in granite within the central part of the licence. The 6th anomaly occurs within the mafic rocks close to the granite contact on the western side of the licence. All soil anomalies, having limited strike of up to 1.2 kilometers and appear to trend north-northeast to east-west.

Follow-up trenching was undertaken over soil-in-gold anomalies (Table 41). Nine trenches, averaging 15 meters in length and totalling 150 meters, were orientated normal to the soil anomaly trend (Map 35). Thin quartz veins not exceeding 25 centimeters in width were encountered in some of the trenches. Two meter channel samples were undertaken at the base of the trench and the quartz veins were individually sampled. Samples were submitted to SGS Laboratory Mwanza for 50 gram Fire assay. Results from the trench sampling returned no gold values in any of the trenches. A total of 31 rock samples have been collected and analysed for gold (Table 42).

Results of the follow-up exploration on the intial soil sampling anomalies were generally poor, with none of the trenches returning any anomalous gold values.
Future Exploration
Exploration is to be focused on investigating:
i.
Anomaly 1, located along the granite/metavolcanic contact that has been cut by a prominent NW-SE shear zone. Active artisanal workings occur along the shear zone some 500 meters NW of the licence.
ii.
The E-W striking quartz veins in Anomalies 2 and 3 which returned anomalous gold values.
iii.
The N-S trending Anomaly 4.
iv.
The quartz vein that returned 5.15 g/t gold on the northern slope of Kiterere Hill in the Eastern part of the Prospect.
v.
The old colonial shaft at the base of Getangana Hill
Mapping, trenching and possible Schlumberger VES profiling are planned to complete this phase of exploration.
Maji Moto HQ-P23869
A recent acquisition to the North Mara group of licences is the Maji Moto licence that was awarded to the Company by the Ministry of Mines through application and tender in April 2012.
The licence is situated in the North Mara Greenstone Belt (Eastern Musoma Goldfields) approximately 28 kilometers to the SW of African Barrick’s North Mara Gold Mine (Map 36).
Map 36:. Location map of Maji Moto HQ-P23869
Note: HQ-O23869 is the Application number. The licence has yet to be allocated a PL number by the Ministry. Artisanal workings: Three artisanal sites are present in the northern part of the licence (Map 37):
1.
Located at Kitarahota Hill, some 2 kilometres east of Maji Moto village is actively being mined by a relatively small group of artisanal miners. The site, located on the lower slope of the Kitarahota Hill, consists mostly of surface workings.
2.
Nyamarubiti Hill, located in the north-eastern arm of the licence was an active artisanal site in 1980s and is only be worked sporadically by a handful of artisanal miners.
3.
Kebosi Hill, situated on the NW arm of the PL and east of the much larger Kitengara Hill. This site appears not as extensively mined as site 2 and is currently not being mined by artisanal miners.
Map 37 Geology of HQ-P23869
Other than a reconnaissance visit to the licence, exploration has not yet commenced.
The following exploration strategy (Phase 1) will be followed as soon as a field camp is established on site:
Regional ground Magnetic survey
Regional mapping of the licence
Regional soilsampling on 200 meter x 50 meter sample grid
Detailed mapping and soil/rock sampling at and around the artisanal sites
Schlumberger profiles across the known artisanal sites.
Phase 2 will be dependant on the results achieved from the Phase 1 exploration programme.
