Details of the Company's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 1994, are set forth in Schedules III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." The discussions set forth below under the headings "Real Estate" and "Mortgage Loans" provide certain summary information concerning the Company's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 1994, the mortgage notes receivable secured by the Continental Hotel and Casino and by the Las Vegas Plaza Shopping Center, both of which are in Las Vegas, Nevada, net of applicable premiums, discounts, interest and deferred gains, accounted for 13% and 12%, respectively, of the Company's total assets. No other single asset of the Company accounted for 10% or more of its total assets. At December 31, 1994, 35% of the Company's assets consisted of real estate, 33% consisted of notes and interest receivable and 29% consisted of investments in the equity securities of CMET, IORT and TCI and NRLP. The remaining 3% of the Company's assets were invested in cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and other assets. It should be noted, however, that the percentage of the Company's assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of the Company's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.

Real Estate (Continued)
Types of Real Estate Investments. The Company's real estate consists of an apartment complex, commercial properties (consisting of an office building, shopping center and a merchandise mart) and two hotels. In selecting new real estate investments, the location, age and type of property, gross rentals, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Company may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of the Company's stockholders.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had completed significant capital improvements to the Kansas City Holiday Inn, a hotel in Kansas City, Missouri. The Company is considering a major expansion of the Denver Mart, a merchandise mart, and the renovation of the Inn at the Mart, a hotel, both in Denver, Colorado, if financing can be obtained.
In the opinion of the Company's management, the properties owned by the Company are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of the Company's owned real estate (excluding land parcels described below) at December 31, 1994.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, commercial square footage and hotel rooms owned by the Company, and does not reflect the value of the Company's investment in each region. Excluded from the above table are two residential subdivisions in Texas with a total of 33 developed residential lots, 3.5 acres of undeveloped land in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, 1.84 acres of undeveloped land in Maricopa County, Arizona, a 2.75 acre former hotel site in Lihue, Hawaii and four additional parcels of land totaling approximately 455 acres.

A summary of the activity in the Company's owned real estate portfolio during 1994 is as follows:
* Includes two residential subdivisions with a total of 74 developed residential lots at January 1, 1994 and 33 developed residential lots at December 31, 1994.
Properties Held for Investment. Set forth below are the Company's properties held for investment and the monthly rental rate for apartments, the average annual rental rate for commercial properties and average daily room rate for hotels and occupancy at December 31, 1994 and 1993 for apartments and commercial properties and average occupancy during 1994 and 1993 for hotels:

Occupancy presented above and through this ITEM 2. is without reference to whether leases in effect are at, below or above market rates.
In May 1993, the Company obtained a $1.8 million mortgage secured by the Rosedale Towers, a 84,798 square foot office building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which was previously unencumbered. The Company pledged as additional collateral for the loan 141,176 newly issued shares of its Common Stock. The loan matured April 30, 1994. Effective May 1, 1994, the lender extended the loan's maturity date to May 1, 1997, increased the principal balance to $2.5 million and reduced the interest rate to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus .75% fixed
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Real Estate (Continued)
at the beginning of each quarter currently 13.75% per annum. The loan extension requires monthly interest only payments, with the principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity. In conjunction with the principal balance increase and maturity extension, the Company pledged as additional collateral an additional 240,000 newly issued shares of its Common Stock. The Company received net cash of $526,000 as a result of the increase in the principal balance, after the payment of various closing costs. The Company paid a 1% loan refinancing fee of $25,000 to BCM based on the $2.5 million refinancing.
In March 1994, the Company acquired for $26,000 in cash, all of the capital stock of the corporate general partner of Merchandise Mart Associates, Ltd. ("Mart, Ltd."). Concurrently, the Company also acquired all of the capital stock of Garden Capital Merchandise Mart, Inc. ("GCMMI") for $1,000 and the assumption of $271,000 in debt including $125,000 payable to the Company. The GCMMI stock was purchased from individuals who also own the corporate general partner of a limited partnership in which NOLP is a 99.3% limited partner. (See "Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships," below.) The assets of GCMMI included a wraparound mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $33.4 million secured by the Denver Mart, a 509,008 square foot merchandise mart in Denver, Colorado, title to the Inn at the Mart, a 156 room hotel adjacent to the Denver Mart and parcels of land contiguous to the Denver Mart. In May 1992, the Company had acquired title to land in Denver, Colorado subject to a ground lease to Mart, Ltd. as lessee, for the operation of the Denver Mart and a 2.9% limited partner interest in Mart, Ltd.
Both the ground lease and the wraparound mortgage note receivable were in default at their respective dates of acquisition and have remained so. The Company is funding operating deficits and is entitled to receive all cash flow, if any, from the Denver Mart. Effective April 1, 1994, the Company recorded the acquisition of the Denver Mart and the assumption of underlying debt of $6.1 million. The Company acquired the wraparound mortgage and the general partner of Mart, Ltd. with the intent of acquiring the Denver Mart, hence its classification as held for investment.
Properties held for sale. As of December 31, 1994, the Company reclassified from "Real estate held for investment" to "Real estate held for sale" the Boulevard Villas Apartments, a 303 unit apartment complex in Las Vegas, Nevada, the sale of which was completed in March 1995. At December 31, 1994, the Company also owned two residential subdivisions in Texas with a total of 33 developed lots, as discussed below, and 3.5 acres of undeveloped land in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, 1.84 acres of undeveloped land in Maricopa County, Arizona, a 2.75 acre former hotel site in Hawaii, four additional parcels of land totaling approximately 455 acres and an office building in St. Louis, Missouri, all of which

are held for sale. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."
In March 1994, the Company sold a restaurant site in Los Angeles, California, that was held for sale, for $190,000. The Company received $90,000 in cash and provided purchase money financing of $100,000. The Company recognized a gain of $18,000 on the sale. The Company paid a real estate sales commission of $5,700 to Carmel Realty based upon the $190,000 sales price of the property.
As of June 30, 1994, the Company reclassified its three apartment complexes in Mississippi and its apartment complex in San Antonio, Texas from "Real estate held for investment" to "Real estate held for sale", the Company having received an offer from a potential buyer to acquire the four properties. As a result of such offer, the Company began actively marketing the properties for sale. The combined carrying value of the four properties was $8.8 million at September 30, 1994.
In November 1994, the Company sold its three Mississippi apartment complexes, Watersedge III Apartments, the Edgewater Garden Apartments, the Chateau Bayou Apartments and its Mediterrean Villa Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, to a newly formed limited partnership in exchange for a 27% limited partner interest in the partnership, $3.2 million in net cash, a $100,000 certificate of deposit, and second and third liens totaling $1.3 million secured by the Mediterranean Villa Apartments. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $5.6 million on the sale, which is offset against the Company's investment in the partnership in the accompanying December 31, 1994, Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has deferred any gain related to the property sales due to the Company having a continuing ownership interest in the properties, through its 27% limited partner interest in the owning partnership and the Company also having the option to reacquire the properties and unwind the partnership under certain circumstances. The Company's option to repurchase the properties and unwind the partnership may be exercised at anytime after September 15, 1995, but prior to September 2, 1997. However, if at anytime during the option period, the net equity of the properties (fair market value less unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest then owing on the mortgages secured by the properties) falls to below $7.5 million, the partnership shall have the right to request in writing that the Company exercise its purchase option within 90 days of the Company's receipt of such request. If the Company fails to exercise the option within such 90 day period, the option terminates. The Company paid a real estate sales commission of $497,000 to Carmel Realty based on a $16.6 million sales price of the properties.
In February 1995, the Company sold the Boulevard Villas Apartments for $9.6 million. The Company initially treated the sale as a financing transaction, the Company having provided the purchaser with his $1.6 million down payment, by loaning a like amount, secured by a second lien on an office building in Houston, Texas, with an approximate value of $8.5 million. In March 1995, the office building was sold and the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Real Estate (Continued)
Company's loan was paid in full. The Company received net cash of $3.4 million after the payoff of $5.9 million in existing mortgage debt. The Company will recognize a gain of approximately $1.0 million on the sale. The Company paid a real estate brokerage commission of $288,000 to Carmel Realty based on the $9.6 million sales price of the property.
In 1991, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of a corporation which owned 181 developed residential lots in Fort Worth, Texas. Through December 31, 1993, 143 of the residential lots had been sold. During 1994, 26 additional lots were sold for an aggregate gain of $46,800. At December 31, 1994, 29 lots remained to be sold.
Also in 1991, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of a company which owns a 60% interest in a joint venture, which in turn owned 113 partially developed residential lots in Denton, Texas. Through December 31, 1993, 84 of the residential lots had been sold. During 1994, 25 additional lots were sold for an aggregate gain of $213,000. At December 31, 1994, 4 lots remained to be sold.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income-producing real estate. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound, and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, the Company has acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1994 consisted of office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping centers, single-family residences, hotels and developed land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgages in which the Company invests without a vote of the Company's stockholders.
At December 31, 1994, the obligors on $10.9 million or 22% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of the Company. Also at that date, $2.2 million or 4% of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio was in default.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance at December 31, 1994), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Company's mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1994. See Schedule

IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for additional details of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1994 is as follows:
* Includes a mortgage note receivable collateralized by two condominium mortgage loans.
During 1994, the Company collected $3.8 million in interest and $2.4 million in principal on its mortgage notes receivable. The Company plans, for the foreseeable future, to hold, to the extent its liquidity permits, rather than to sell in the secondary market, the mortgage notes in its portfolio.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in first mortgage loans, with either short-, medium- or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Company's general policy to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1994.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
In June 1991, the Company entered into an asset sales agreement with an insurance company whereby the Company sold real estate and participations in various of its assets in an effort to develop a potential source for future financing and to generate cash from otherwise illiquid assets. Assets transferred by the Company pursuant to the asset sales agreement included a retail shopping center in Lubbock, Texas, with a carrying value of $2.0 million prior to transfer, a $1.5 million senior participation in a second lien mortgage note secured by the Las Vegas Plaza, a retail shopping center in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a carrying value of $18.8 million prior to transfer, a $315,000 participation in a first mortgage note secured by unimproved land in Virginia Station, Virginia and a $799,000 participation in a second lien mortgage note secured by the Country Club Apartments, an apartment complex in Flagstaff, Arizona. In return, the Company received a $1.9 million participation in a first mortgage note secured by a hotel site in Lihue, Hawaii, a $1.0 million first mortgage note secured by land in Maricopa County, Arizona, a $118,000 first mortgage note secured by a single-family residence in Silver Creek, Colorado and $1.5 million in cash. The asset sales agreement contained put and guaranty provisions whereby, at any time, either party could demand that the seller reacquire any asset sold pursuant to the terms of the asset sales agreement for the consideration originally received. In March 1992, the Company received payment in full on the $118,000 note secured by the single-family residence in Silver Creek, Colorado.
In March 1992, the insurance company was placed in receivership and in June 1992, the Company provided notice to the insurance company, under the terms of the put and guaranty provisions of the asset sales agreement, of its desire to divest itself of all assets received. The Receiver refused to allow the enforcement of the put and guaranty provisions of the asset sales agreement. In September 1992, the court approved the Receiver's Petition for an Order of Liquidation for the insurance company.
In March 1992, the Company recorded a provision for loss of $496,000 to reduce the note receivable secured by land in Maricopa County, Arizona to its then estimated fair value. The Company foreclosed on the land securing the note in June 1992. In December 1992, the Company recorded an additional provision for loss on such land of $349,000, to reduce the carrying value of the land to its then estimated fair value. In September 1992, the Company recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the hotel site in Lihue, Hawaii, which secured a $1.9 million first mortgage participation received by the Company. In March 1995, the Company collected in full the second lien mortgage note secured by the Country Club Apartments, but did not remit such amount to the insurance company.
The Company has reached a settlement with the Receiver for the insurance company which was approved by the court on February 15, 1995. Under the terms of the settlement, the insurance company is to return to the Company all of the assets which it received from the Company, except for the participation in the first mortgage note secured by unimproved land in Virginia Station, Virginia. In exchange, the Company is to return to
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)

the insurance company $1.0 million in cash and all assets, which it received from the insurance company, other than the note secured by the residence in Colorado which the Company collected. The asset transfers and the Company's cash payment are anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 1995. The settlement requires the Company to pay interest on the cash portion of the settlement from March 17, 1995 until the asset transfers are completed. Interest is payable monthly in advance. The Company expects to incur no loss on the settlement in excess of amounts previously provided.
The borrower on a $1.7 million first mortgage note receivable secured by land in Osceola, Florida has failed to make the required payments subsequent to August 10, 1993, including the payment of principal and interest due at the note's maturity on November 1, 1993. The Company instituted foreclosure proceedings and was awarded a summary judgment in January 1994. During 1994, the borrower paid the Company a total of $235,000 in nonrefundable fees to delay foreclosure of the property. In February and March 1995, the borrower paid the Company a total of $35,000 to delay the foreclosure until April 24, 1995. The note had a principal balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 1994. The Company does not expect to incur any loss upon foreclosure of the collateral property as its estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value of the note.
In June 1994, the Company and the borrower on a $1.9 million first mortgage note receivable, which had matured on December 31, 1992 and was secured by a vacant former hotel in Shaker Heights, Ohio, entered into an agreement of settlement and release. The Company accepted $1.0 million in cash and the right to participate in the future appreciation of the property, if any, in full settlement of its note. The Company incurred no loss in excess of the amounts previously provided.
The Company did not receive the payment due on October 1, 1991 on the first mortgage note receivable, secured by the 386 Ocean Parkway Co-op. In February 1994, the Company agreed to reinstate and modify its note in exchange for the pledge to the Company, as additional collateral, of 21 shares in the co-op equating to 21 unsold apartment units. The reinstated note reduced the principal balance from $900,000 to $750,000, waived all defaults on the note and extended the maturity date of the note to September 15, 1999. In June 1994, the Company sold its mortgage note receivable and the 21 unsold apartment units for $450,000 in cash. The Company incurred no loss on the sale in excess of the amounts previously provided.
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, as partial consideration for the sale of a restaurant site in Los Angeles, California, the Company provided $100,000 of purchase money financing. The note bears interest at 8% per annum and requires monthly interest only payments until May 1, 1997, at which time the principal balance shall have been paid down to no more than $50,000. Interest only payments are to continue until maturity on April 1, 1999, at which time all unpaid principal and accrued interest shall be due.

Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in wraparound mortgage notes, sometimes called all-inclusive notes, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage note is a mortgage note having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage debt plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage note.
Wraparound mortgage notes may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgages in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make a first mortgage loan. The following discussion briefly describes events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1994.
In August 1990, the Company foreclosed on its fourth lien note receivable secured by the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company acquired the hotel and casino property at foreclosure subject to first and second lien mortgages totaling $10.0 million and a disputed third lien mortgage. In June 1992, the Company sold the hotel and casino to the third lienholder for a $22 million wraparound mortgage note receivable, a $500,000 unsecured note receivable, and $100,000 in cash. The $22 million note bears interest at 11%, originally was to mature June 19, 1995, and required monthly interest payments of $175,000 through December 1993, $250,000 through June 1, 1995 and a "balloon" payment at maturity. The $500,000 note was paid off on July 30, 1993. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $4.3 million in connection with the sale of the hotel and casino resulting from the disputed third lien mortgage being subordinated to the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable. Payments of interest and principal on the Company's wraparound note receivable are made directly by the borrower to the holder of the first and second lien mortgages and are applied against interest and principal thereon. In October 1993, the borrower ceased making the monthly payments required by the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable to the holder of the first and second lien mortgages. In April 1994, the Company, the borrower and the underlying lienholder agreed to modify and extend both the Company's wraparound note receivable and the underlying liens. The Company's modified wraparound mortgage note receivable continues to accrue interest at 11% per annum with any unpaid interest being added monthly to the principal balance and required payments of $150,000 per month through January 1, 1995, at which time the monthly payments increased to $175,000 until the note's new maturity date of July 1, 1995, when the unpaid principal balance together with any accrued but unpaid interest is due. The borrower is making payments in accordance with the terms of the modified note. The Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable had a principal balance of $22.7 million at December 31, 1994, including compounded interest.
In conjunction with the modification of the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable, the underlying lienholder agreed to forebear exercising its rights under the first and second liens on the condition

Mortgage Loans (Continued)
that the Company remit to it the greater of either $150,000 or all sums received by the Company, after May 1, 1994, on the Company's wraparound mortgage note receivable and that the Company make a principal reduction payment of $225,000 upon execution of the forbearance agreement, which was made on June 29, 1994. The Company is in compliance with the terms of the forbearance agreement.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage notes. Such notes are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such notes ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the note, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage notes funded in 1994 and the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage notes, during 1994.
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, in November 1994, the Company sold to a newly formed partnership, in which the Company has a 27% limited partner interest, its apartment complex in San Antonio, Texas, along with its three apartment complexes in Biloxi, Mississippi. In conjunction with the sale, the Company received second and third lien mortgages totaling $1.3 million secured by the apartment complex in San Antonio, Texas. Both notes require interest only payments at 6% per annum, with principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity, September 1, 2004.
At December 31, 1994, the Company held a mortgage note receivable which it had acquired in 1989, secured by a third lien mortgage secured by a commercial property in South Carolina and personal guaranties of several individuals. In May 1992, a settlement was entered into between the Company and the guarantors. In accordance with the terms of the settlement, the borrower made a principal reduction payment of $127,812, and monthly interest payments on the note at a rate of 10% per annum. The note matured May 11, 1993. Effective May 11, 1993, the note was again modified to bear interest at 18% per annum, have a maturity date of October 1, 1993, and provide for monthly principal payments of $200,000 July 1, 1993 through October 1, 1993. The Company received none of the payments required by this second modification. Effective September 1, 1993, the note was modified a third time. The guarantors paid $100,000, $68,000 of which was applied to reduce the note's principal balance and the remainder to bring interest on the note current. The third modification extended the note's maturity date to September 1, 1995, required monthly interest payments at 12% per annum beginning October 1, 1993 and a $25,000 principal reduction payment every ninety days beginning December 1, 1993. The borrower has failed to make the required payments of principal and interest since December 1, 1994. The Company has accelerated the note and is in the process of instituting foreclosure proceedings as well as actions against the guarantors of the note. The principal balance of the note was $422,000 at December 31, 1994. The Company expects to incur no loss on the note in excess of the amounts previously provided.

Other Loans
In April 1990, SAMLP made a $1.4 million unsecured loan to Equity Health and Finance Corporation ("Equity Health"), an entity affiliated with BCM, the Company's advisor. The Company owns a 76.8% limited partner interest in SAMLP which it consolidates for financial statement purposes. In June 1991, Equity Health merged into BCM and BCM assumed the note. The loan matured on May 9, 1994 and its outstanding balance of $497,000, including accrued but unpaid interest, was paid in full.
In May 1990, the Company guaranteed up to $3.0 million of a $14.0 million loan secured by a hotel in California. In return for such guarantee, the borrower was required to pay an annual fee to the Company of $45,000 of which only the fee due in 1990 was paid. Because it located the financing for the hotel and a party to guarantee the loan, an entity beneficially owned by Mr. Phillips was granted a profits participation by the borrower and was to receive certain other consideration. The guarantee was to continue in effect until all of the guaranteed obligations had been paid, performed, satisfied and discharged. In April 1991, the Company advanced $357,000 on a note secured by the hotel, pursuant to the guarantee and an additional $101,000 was advanced in June 1991, also on a note secured by the hotel.
In January 1992, the Company received notice that the lender had declared an event of default on the $14.0 million loan and in June 1993 the lender foreclosed on the hotel securing the loan. In May 1994, the Company and the lender entered into a settlement agreement relating to the Company's performance under its guarantee. Pursuant to the settlement agreement the Company is to pay a total of $850,000 to the lender, $750,000 of which was paid in 1994, with the remaining $100,000 to be paid on or before March 31, 1995. The Company had written off its two notes receivable secured by the foreclosed hotel as uncollectible as of December 31, 1993. The Company did not incur a loss with respect to either the guarantee settlement or the notes receivable in excess of the amounts previously provided.

The Company's investment in real estate entities includes (i) equity securities of three publicly traded REITs (collectively the "Trusts"), CMET, IORT and TCI, (ii) units of limited partner interest of NRLP, (iii) a general partner interest in NRLP and NOLP, through its 76.8% limited partner interest in SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, and (iv) interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. Mr. Phillips, Chairman of the Board and a Director of the Company until November 16, 1992, serves as a director and Chief Executive Officer of SAMI, a company owned by BCM, which serves as SAMLP's managing general partner. Mr. Phillips is also a general partner of SAMLP. BCM serves as advisor to the Trusts, and performs certain administrative and management functions for NRLP and NOLP on behalf of SAMLP.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP in 1989, the Company has made additional investments in the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The Company's cost with respect to shares of the Trusts at December 31, 1994 totaled $22.1 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $25.9 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of such equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP at December 31, 1994 was $35.2 million and the aggregate market value of such equity securities was $59.5 million. The aggregate investee book value of the equity securities of the Trusts and the Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity based upon the December 31, 1994 financial statements of each such entity was $55.0 million and $144.9 million, respectively. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
In 1990, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and in May 1993 reaffirmed the expenditure by the Company of up to an aggregate of $17.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, additional units of NRLP and shares of the Trusts. In March 1995, the Company's Board of Directors increased such authorization to $25.0 million. As of March 17, 1995, the Company had expended $12.8 million to acquire additional units of NRLP and an aggregate of $7.0 million to acquire additional shares of the Trusts, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. The Company expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP.
At December 31, 1994, SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, owned 17,650 shares of TCI. The Company owns a 76.8% limited partnership interest in SAMLP which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes.
The purchases of the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP were made for the purpose of investment and were based principally on the opinion of the Company's management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination by the Company to purchase additional equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP is made on an entity-by-entity basis and depends on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of the Company's management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities.
Because the Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of these entities, the Company accounts for its investment in the Trusts, NRLP, and the joint venture partnerships using the equity method of accounting. Substantially all of the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP owned by the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings.
Pertinent information regarding the Company's investment in the equity securities of the Trusts and NRLP, entities which are accounted for
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
under the equity method at December 31, 1994, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
____________________
* At December 31, 1994, NRLP reported a deficit partners' capital. The Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity, however, was $144.9 million. Revaluation equity is defined as the difference between the appraised value of the partnership's real estate, adjusted to reflect the partnership's estimate of disposition costs, and the amount of the mortgage notes payable and accrued interest encumbering such property as reported in NRLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.
Each of the Trusts and NRLP own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, particularly in the case of NRLP, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. The Company's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
The Company does not have a controlling equity interest in any of the investees set forth in the table above and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of such investees. However, due to the Company's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of the Trusts, and that the Trusts have the same advisor as the Company and that Mr. Cashwell, a Director of the Company, is also the President of the Trusts and BCM, the Company's advisor, and the President and a director of SAMI, a Company owned by BCM, that is the managing general partner of SAMLP, the Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of these entities. As more fully discussed in "NRLP" below, SAMLP has agreed to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP upon the election and qualification of a successor general partner. The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of these entities currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The carrying value of these entities, set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of each entity's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of NRLP and the Trusts, based upon information publicly reported by such entities.
NRLP. NRLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership which was formed under the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act on January 29, 1987. It commenced operations on September 18, 1987 when, through NOLP, it acquired all of the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of 35 public and private limited partnerships sponsored by or otherwise related to Southmark Corporation ("Southmark"). NRLP is the sole limited partner of NOLP and owns 99% of the beneficial interest in NOLP. NRLP and NOLP operate as an economic unit and, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Partnership shall constitute references to NRLP and NOLP as a unit. The general partner and owner of 1% of the beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP is SAMLP, a Delaware limited partnership. SAMI, a company owned by BCM, is the managing general partner of SAMLP. In November 1992, NOLP transferred 52 apartment complexes and a wraparound mortgage note receivable to Garden Capital, L.P. ("GCLP"), a Delaware limited partnership in which NOLP owns a 99.3% limited partner interest. Concurrent with such transfer, GCLP refinanced all of the mortgage debt associated with the transferred properties and the wraparound mortgage note under a new first mortgage in the amount of $223 million.
The Company is a limited partner in SAMLP, holding a 76.8% limited partner interest therein, which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes. Southmark owns a 19.2% limited partner interest in SAMLP. Mr. Phillips and SAMI are the general partners of SAMLP.
SAMI, as the managing general partner of SAMLP, has discretion in determining methods of obtaining funds for the Partnership's operations, and the acquisition and disposition of its assets. The Partnership's governing documents place no limitation on the amount of leverage that the Partnership may incur either in the aggregate or with respect to any particular property or other investment. At December 31, 1994, the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the Partnership's real estate portfolio was 47.9% computed on the basis of the ratio of total property-related debt to aggregate appraised values.
As of December 31, 1994, NRLP owned 84 properties located in 22 states. These properties consisted of 68 apartment complexes comprising 17,294 units, seven office buildings with an aggregate of 495,594 square feet and nine shopping centers with an aggregate of 1.1 million square feet.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Partnership reported net income of $5.0 million compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1993. The Partnership's loss from operations of $3.2 million in 1994 was a 59% improvement when compared to its $7.8 million loss from operations in 1993. The improvement is due in part to an average 4.4% increase in rental rates at the Partnership's apartment complexes. The Partnership's net income in 1994 was attributable to an $8.3 million gain from the sale of two of its apartment complexes in Michigan. The Partnership's net income in 1993 was attributable to a $9.0 million extraordinary gain from its acquisition at a discount of certain of its mortgage debt. At December 31, 1994, the Partnership had total assets of $290.1 million which consisted of $241.6 million in real estate held for investment or sale, $11.5 million in notes and interest receivable, net of allowance for estimated losses, $33.3 million in other assets and $3.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Partnership resumed distributions to unitholders at the initial rate of $0.20 per unit. The Company received aggregate distributions from the Partnership of $170,000 in 1993. In 1994, the Partnership paid distributions of $1.30 per unit, the Company receiving a total of $1.4 million.
The Partnership, SAMLP, Mr. Phillips and William S. Friedman, a general partner of SAMLP until March 4, 1994, were among the defendants in a class action lawsuit arising out of the transactions discussed above whereby the Partnership was formed. An agreement settling such lawsuit as to the defendants, the Partnership, SAMLP and Messrs. Phillips and Friedman (the "Moorman Settlement Agreement"), became effective on July 5, 1990. The Moorman Settlement Agreement provides for, among other things, the appointment of an oversight committee for NRLP; the establishment of specified annually increasing targets for a five-year period relating to the price of NRLP units; a limitation and deferral or waiver of NRLP's reimbursement to SAMLP of certain future salary costs; and a deferral or waiver of certain future compensation to SAMLP; the required distribution to unitholders of all of the Partnership's cash from operations in excess of certain renovation costs unless the NRLP oversight committee approves alternative uses for such cash from operations; and the issuance of unit purchase warrants to members of the plaintiff class; the contribution by certain co-defendants of cash and notes payable to the Partnership aggregating $5.5 million including $2.5 million contributed by SAMLP on behalf of itself and pursuant to the indemnification provisions of SAMLP's agreement of limited partnership, $500,000 of which was paid in 1990, with the remainder being paid over a four-year period. The final annual installment of principal and interest of $631,000 was paid by SAMLP in May 1994. The Partnership also agreed to pay certain settlement costs, including plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in the amount of $3.4 million. The settlement plan remains in effect for five years from May 9, 1990, or until the withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
The Moorman Settlement Agreement provides for the resignation and replacement of SAMLP as general partner if the price targets are not met for two consecutive anniversary dates. The Partnership did not meet the unit price targets for the first and second anniversary dates. On July 8, 1992, SAMLP notified the NRLP Oversight Committee of the failure to meet the unit price targets for two successive years and that it expects to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner would require the Partnership to purchase SAMLP's general partner interest (the "Redeemable General Partner Interest") at its then fair value, and to pay certain fees and other compensation as provided in the partnership agreement. SAMI, the managing general partner of SAMLP, has calculated the fair value of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be $33.0 million at December 31, 1994, before reduction for the principal balance ($4.2 million at December 31, 1994) and accrued interest ($4.3 million at December 31, 1994) on the note receivable from SAMLP for its original capital contribution to the Partnership. There can be no assurance that such amount at the time of any such withdrawal will not be substantially higher or lower. The NRLP oversight committee previously has informed the Partnership that it calculated the amount of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be less than the amount calculated by SAMI. Any dispute pertaining to the amount of the Redeemable General Partner Interest upon the withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP, will be resolved by the Judge appointed pursuant to the Moorman Settlement Agreement to supervise its implementation (the "Supervisory Judge").
In January 1995, SAMLP, the Partnership and the NRLP oversight committee executed an Implementation Agreement which provides for the nomination of a successor general partner and for the resolution of all related matters under the Moorman Settlement Agreement. The Implementation Agreement is subject to receipt of a notice from the proposed successor general partner nominee that it consents to stand for election as the successor general partner.
The Implementation Agreement shall be submitted to the Supervising Judge for tentative approval and approval of the notice to be sent to the original class members. Upon final approval by the Supervising Judge, the proposal to elect the successor general partner will be submitted to the unitholders of the Partnership for a vote. In addition, the unitholders will vote upon amendments to the Partnership's partnership agreement which relate to the proposed compensation of the successor general partner and other related matters.
Upon approval by the unitholders, SAMLP shall resign as General Partner and the successor general partner shall take office. If the required approvals are obtained, it is anticipated that the successor general partner may be elected and take office during the third or fourth quarter of 1995.
The Implementation Agreement provides that SAMLP, and its affiliates owning units in the Partnership, shall not vote to remove the successor
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
general partner, except for removal with cause, for a period of thirty months from the date the successor general partner takes office. In addition, the Supervising Judge shall make a determination of any amounts which the Partnership may owe to SAMLP upon SAMLP's withdrawal as General Partner and any amounts which SAMLP or its affiliates may owe to the Partnership. Any amounts which the Partnership may be determined to owe to SAMLP may be paid by the Partnership over a period of time to be determined by the parties on terms which shall not hinder the Partnership's ability to meet its other financial obligations.
Upon the election and taking office of the successor general partner, the Moorman settlement plan and the NRLP oversight committee shall be terminated. If the successor general partner nominee does not stand for election or is not elected, the existing Moorman Settlement Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and all of the provisions of the Implementation Agreement shall be voided. The Partnership's purchase of the Redeemable General Partner Interest could have an adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition and on the Company's investment in the Partnership ($13.7 million at December 31, 1994).
CMET. CMET is a California business trust organized in 1980 which commenced operations on December 3, 1980. CMET's primary business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments, and partnerships and financing real estate and real estate- related activities through investments in mortgage notes, including first, wraparound and junior mortgage notes. CMET holds equity investments in apartment complexes and commercial properties (office buildings, industrial facilities and shopping centers) throughout the continental United States. CMET's apartment complexes and commercial properties are concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions of the continental United States. CMET also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest region of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Southeast and Midwest regions. CMET has determined that it will not consider future mortgage lending, except in connection with purchase money financing offered to facilitate the sale of its assets.
For the year ended December 31, 1994, CMET reported a net loss of $833,000 as compared with net income of $615,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993. CMET's net loss for 1994 includes a provision for loss of $1.4 million as compared to $221,000 in 1993 and a gain on sale of real estate of $1.7 million in 1994 as compared to $365,000 in 1993. Cash flow from property operations (rentals collected less payments for property operating expenses) improved to $10.7 million in 1994 compared to $8.4 million in 1993. At December 31, 1994, CMET had total assets of $182.8 million which consisted of $7.1 million in mortgage notes and interest receivable (net of allowance for estimated losses), $124.7 million in real estate held for investment, $19.5 million in real estate held for sale, $24.0 million in investments in partnerships and other assets and $7.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
In March 1993, CMET resumed the payment of regular quarterly distributions at the initial rate of $0.10 per share. The rate was increased to $0.15 per share for the September 1993 quarterly distribution. The Company received distributions from CMET totaling $428,000 in 1993. In 1994, CMET paid distributions of $0.60 per share, the Company receiving a total of $587,000.
As of March 17, 1995, CMET owned 204,522 shares of the Company's Common Stock, approximately 7% of the shares then outstanding.
IORT. IORT is a California business trust organized in 1984 which commenced operations on April 10, 1985. IORT is scheduled, unless and until IORT's shareholders decide on a contrary course of action, to begin liquidation of its assets prior to October 24, 1996. IORT's Declaration of Trust calls for the distribution to shareholders of (i) the net cash proceeds from sale or refinancing of equity investments, and (ii) the net cash proceeds from the satisfaction of mortgage notes receivable received after October 24, 1996. However, IORT's board of trustees has discretionary authority to hold any investment past October 24, 1996, should circumstances so dictate. IORT holds equity investments in apartment complexes and office buildings in the Pacific, Southwest, Southeast and Midwest regions of the continental United States. IORT also holds one mortgage note receivable.
For the year ended December 31, 1994, IORT reported a net loss of $287,000 as compared with a net income of $875,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993. IORT's 1993 net income is attributable to an extraordinary gain of $806,000 due to its early payoff of mortgage debt. Cash flow from property operations however, improved to $3.7 million in 1994 from $3.0 million in 1993. At December 31, 1994, IORT had total assets of $49.0 million which consisted of $41.0 million in real estate held for sale, $2.0 million in notes and interest receivable, $5.8 million in investments in partnerships and other assets and $232,000 in cash and cash equivalents.
IORT resumed the payment of regular quarterly distributions in March 1993, at an initial rate of $0.10 per share. The rate was increased to $0.15 per share for the September 1993 quarterly distribution. The Company received distributions from IORT totaling $72,000 in 1993. In 1994, IORT paid total distributions of $0.60 per share, the Company receiving a total of $88,000.
TCI. TCI is a Nevada corporation which was originally organized in 1984 as a California business trust, and commenced operations on January 31, 1984. TCI has investment policies similar to those of CMET. TCI holds equity investments in apartment complexes and commercial properties (office buildings, industrial facilities and shopping centers) throughout the continental United States with a concentration in the Northeast, Southeast and Southwest regions. TCI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and Southwest regions, with a concentration in the Northeast

and Southeast regions. Like CMET, TCI has also determined that it will not consider future mortgage lending, except in conjunction with purchase money financing offered to facilitate the sale of its assets.
For the year ended December 31, 1994, TCI reported a net loss of $3.4 million as compared with a net loss of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1993. The decrease in TCI's 1994 net loss is attributable to gains from the sale of real estate and partnership interests totaling $4.7 million compared to $24,000 in 1993 and an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million in 1994 compared to an extraordinary gain of $1.6 million in 1993. Cash flow from property operations decreased slightly to $8.6 million in 1994 as compared to $8.7 million in 1993. At December 31, 1994, TCI had total assets of $248.0 million, which consisted of $11.3 million in notes and interest receivable (net of allowance for estimated losses), $213.4 million in real estate held for investment, $8.3 million in real estate held for sale, $14.4 million in investments in real estate entities and other assets and $563,000 in cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 1994, TCI owned 170,750 of IORT's shares of beneficial interest, approximately 22% of the shares then outstanding.
TCI's dividend policy provides for an annual determination of dividends, after TCI's year end. The minimum amount of dividends will be determined by the amount, if any, required to maintain TCI's status as a REIT for federal tax purposes. The Company received no dividends from TCI in 1993 nor 1994 and does not expect to receive any dividends in 1995.
SAMLP. Prior to February 25, 1992, the Company owned a 96% limited partner interest in SAMLP, the general partner of and holder of a 1% beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP. In accordance with the settlement of the Southmark adversary proceedings as described in ITEM 3.
