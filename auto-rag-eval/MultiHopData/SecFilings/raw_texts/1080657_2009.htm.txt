Our sale of a 5.99% interest in Garden Gateway Plaza in 2008 resulted in our breach of our covenant not to transfer an interest in this property under the terms of our loan secured by the Garden Gateway Plaza. We have requested the lender’s consent and waiver to this transfer. Based on the lender’s response thus far, we believe that we have resolved this matter at a cost of approximately $50,000 that has been recorded as an expense in 2009. Although we consider the possibility of occurrence remote, the lender has the right to accelerate immediate payment of the loan. We believe we have the financial resources to pay the loan if we are required to do so. Please see Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis Of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Activities for further discussion of this matter.
Description of Properties
Casa Grande Apartments
This is a 39-unit apartment complex, including related improvements, on approximately 1.2 acres. The property is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The complex contains a total of twenty (20) two-bedroom apartments, and nineteen (19) single-bedroom apartments. The enclosed living areas aggregate approximately 29,250 square feet. The property was constructed in 1973.
Cheyenne, which is located in the southeast corner of the state, has a population of approximately 82,000. The property is located at 921 E. 17th Street, which is in the city’s downtown area in an established residential neighborhood next to Holiday Park, the city’s largest public park. The neighborhood is comprised of approximately 70% single family residences, 10% multi-family housing, 15% commercial uses and 5% industrial uses.
We lease the property to tenants on a month-to-month basis. The roof of the property was replaced in 1996. We plan no major renovations to the property within the next 36 months. As of December 31, 2009, the property is 84.6% occupied. Current rental rates are $545 for single bedroom units and $600 for the 2-bedroom units. The property competes for tenants with comparable multi-unit properties and single family residences in its area. We believe the property is comparable or superior to other multi-unit properties in the area considering its location and close proximity to Holiday Park, one of the more desirable areas of the city.
The complex is constructed of wood frame with stucco exterior and wood facing and trim. The complex includes paved parking for approximately sixty cars (1.5 places per apartment unit). The grounds of the building contain approximately 20,000 square feet of open area, which is fully landscaped with concrete walks throughout the site. The property was constructed in 1973.
In 2008, the Company sold approximately 79.93% of its interests in Casa Grande. In 2009, the Company and the other tenants in common in the property contributed their respective interests in Casa Grande into a DOWNREIT Partnership for which we serve as general partner and in which we own a 20.07% equity interest.

We borrowed $3.6 million to finance this purchase at the date of acquisition.

In September 2006, we acquired a stand alone-single use retail property located at 850 West Mission Road, Escondido, California. This property consists of a 3,000 sq. ft. retail building situated on an approximately 12,000 sq. ft. corner lot. It is located at the corner of West Mission Road and Rock Springs Road in a mixed commercial, light industrial and residential area. The property consists of a one-story, brick and wood constructed building with a cement stucco exterior and an asphalt-paved parking lot.
The building is currently under lease to 7-Eleven, Inc. and is operated as a convenience store. The lease provides for minimum monthly rent of $9,000. The lease, which was originally terminable on December 31, 2008, has been extended to December 31, 2018 with minimum monthly rent of $9,000 during the first 5 years and $10,350 during the second 5 years. The lease is not subject to any renewal options. The lease is a triple net lease requiring the tenant to pay all property related operating costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
In June 2007, we sold a 48.6% undivided interest in the Escondido 7-Eleven property to the Allen Trust DTD 7-9-1999 (the “Trust”). We sold the 48.6% interest in the property for $680,425, which equaled the pro rata share of agreed upon fair value for the property, including most of our acquisition costs and expenses. As a condition to the transaction, the parties, among other things, agreed to engage CHG Properties, Inc. to manage the property. We structured this transaction to satisfy the requirements of a tax deferred exchange under Section 1031 of the IRC. We do not believe that we will recognize taxable gain or loss as a result of this transaction.
In April 2008, we and the Trust contributed each of our interests in this property to a California limited partnership (the “NetREIT 01 LP Partnership) for which we serve as general partner and own a 51.4% equity interest. In connection with the formation of the NetREIT 01 LP Partnership, we gave the Trust the right to exchange its interest in the NetREIT 01 LP Partnership for shares of our common stock.

Our Real Estate Loan Investments
Mortgage loan investments have been a very minor source of our revenue since our inception. As a general policy, we are not in the business of originating mortgage loans.
Mortgages receivable, together with accrued interest, having a balance due of approximately $2.1 million went into default on January 1, 2009. At December 31, 2008, we suspended accruing interest on these loans. In May 2009, we acquired title to the property that was securing the mortgages receivable. The property was acquired at a book value of $2.1 million. The property is not an income producing property, is not an integral component of our real estate asset portfolio and, therefore, is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.
In connection with acquiring title to this property, we entered into an exclusive option to sell the property to the original borrower. The selling price is equal to the face value of the notes, all accrued interest through the date the we acquired title to the property, all costs incurred to maintain the property including taxes and insurance plus additional charges equal to 1.75% of the outstanding balance per month from June 2009 through the date the option is exercised. The selling price was set at approximately $2.3 million as of the closing date and increases by a minimum of approximately $41,000 monthly, plus reimbursable expenses, until 18 months from the date the we acquired title at which time the exclusive option to sell the property expires. We do not anticipate incurring any losses with respect to this property.
During 2008, we sold undivided interests in Garden Gateway Plaza and Sparky’s Palm Self-Storage properties. In connection with these sales, we took back notes from the buyers in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.9 million. The notes are secured by the buyers’ interests in these properties.
