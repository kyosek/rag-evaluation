Significant Projects and Properties
The Company's exploration activities are currently primarily focused on three Gulf Coast trends, the Texas Gulf Coast trend, the Mississippi/Alabama trend and the Sunniland trend. In addition, the Company is pursuing select projects in South Louisiana and elected in December 1996 to participate in its initial international project located in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
Geologically, 3-D imaging of the structural and stratigraphic complexities common in the Gulf Coast provides the Company with an ability to identify significant hydrocarbon potential in and around existing fields that could not be detected with 2-D and conventional exploration techniques. Due to geologic complexities within this region, it may be possible to identify multiple prospects within a single project. These prospects typically offer multiple drilling opportunities with individual wells capable of encountering multiple reservoirs. As demonstrated by its election to participate in a project located in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, the Company believes it can extend its trend strategy into other select geographic areas where the application of 3-D imaging technology can be utilized to reduce the primary geological risks prior to drilling.
Technically, the extensive drilling history within Gulf Coast trends provides a powerful subsurface and production database to which seismic data can be calibrated. These data provide the foundation required to design a seismic program that optimizes resolution at targeted reservoirs. These data, when combined with 3-D seismic data, provide a more accurate assessment of reservoir quality, productivity and reserve potential and in some instances, fluid type.
The following sets forth a brief summary of the Company's exploration trend areas and significant projects and properties. Although the Company is aggressively pursuing activities in each of the following areas, there can be no assurance that drilling opportunities will be identified or, if drilled, will be successful.
Texas Gulf Coast Trend
In the Texas Gulf Coast trend, the Company anticipates drilling between 20 to 30 gross wells in 1997 with budgeted capital expenditures approximating $10 to $15 million net to the Company's working interest. Of these wells, two have commenced drilling as of March 26, 1997. The Company and its partners control in excess of 125,000 gross acres in this trend. Between February 1996 and March 26, 1997, the Company and its partners have drilled nine wells in the trend, including the three drilled in 1997, eight of which have encountered commercial quantities of oil and gas. The Company has successfully utilized the 3DXpress process on 8,400 acres overlying six of these discoveries. At February 28, 1997, these six wells were producing in excess of 10.0 MMcfe/d. The Company has completed utilizing the 3DXpress process on five 3-D imaging program and has scheduled four additional programs during the second and third quarters of 1997 totaling 180 square miles in the trend. The Company's working interests in this trend currently range from 6% to 40%.
The Texas Gulf Coast trend includes both onshore and offshore properties and generally extends along the Texas coast from Houston south to the Mexican border. Prospective geology in the trend is characterized by numerous stacked sand formations that were deposited continuously by river channels and deltas. The trend's primary historical oil and gas producing formations include the Wilcox, Frio, Yegua and Miocene.
The Company currently holds working interests in the Texas Gulf Coast trend as described below:
Cove and McPac Fields. The Company proposed and drilled a well with its partner, Bellwether Exploration Company, into a new fault block of the Cove and McPac Fields in August 1996 and discovered commercial quantities of gas in two reservoirs. The Company owns a 7% working interest in the Cove McPac Gas Unit Number One well which is currently producing in excess of 9.0 MMcfe/d from 115 feet of perforated zones. The Cove and McPac Fields' acreage is held by production and is located in Matagorda Island Block 487- L, Texas state waters, 96 miles southwest of Houston in 60 feet of water.
Gila Bend. The Company joined its partner, Ameritex Ventures, Ltd., in the project in December 1995. Integration of a 16-square mile 3-D seismic survey with the geology and production data resulted in a well being spud in July 1996. This well discovered four distinct pay zones of gas and condensate and currently is producing in excess of 3.0 MMcfe/d from the first of the four pay zones. The Company and its partners control 3,525 gross acres in Gila Bend, and the Company owns working interests ranging from 6% to 10%.
Geronimo. The Company completed acquisition of a 77-square mile 3-D seismic survey in October 1996 utilizing the 3DXpress process in the Geronimo project, which is located in San Patricio County, Texas. Primary target formations include the Frio and Vicksburg sands, which are currently producing in fields in the area. The project area covers approximately 25,000 gross acres in which the Company owns a 15% working interest. The Company's partners in this project include Esenjay Petroleum Corporation ("Esenjay"). Commencement of drilling operations is scheduled on this project for the second quarter of 1997.
Bright Falcon. The Company joined its partner, Cox & Perkins Exploration, Inc., in 1993, in the Bright Falcon project, the Company's first project in the Texas Gulf Coast trend. Since then, the Company and its partner have drilled seven wells, five of which were discoveries. As of March 26, 1997, three wells, one of which was recompleted in November 1996, are producing in the Bright Falcon project. The Bright Falcon wells were drilled into Yegua and Frio gas formations after a 26-square mile 3-D seismic survey covering the Lost Bridge-Bright Falcon fields was analyzed by the Company. The project is located in Jackson County, Texas and its acreage is held by production. The Company owns a 17% working interest in this project.
Mississippi/Alabama Trend
In the Mississippi/Alabama trend, the Company anticipates drilling five to eight gross wells in 1997 with budgeted capital expenditures approximating $3 million net to the Company's working interest. The Company and its partner, Esenjay, control over 41,000 gross acres in the trend. The Company completed acquisition of a 3-D seismic survey utilizing the 3DXpress process on a 64- square mile area in November 1996. The Company's first well in this trend commenced drilling in the first quarter of 1997. The Company currently has working interests ranging from approximately 10% to 25% in its properties in the trend.
The Mississippi/Alabama trend includes onshore properties and generally extends across a seven-county area from Newton County in Southern Mississippi eastward through Southern Alabama to the Florida border. Prospective geology in
the trend is characterized by discrete occurrences of basement and salt-related features that deform shallower sand formations to create potential structural traps for oil and gas. The primary historical oil and gas producing formations in the trend have been the Cotton Valley, Lower Haynesville, Smackover and Norphlet.
Sunniland Trend
The Company's partner in the Sunniland trend project is Plains Resources, Inc. ("Plains"). As part of its anticipated initial exploration of the Sunniland trend in 1997, the Company plans to acquire a 3-D survey utilizing the 3DXpress process and to drill a well on a prospect that the Company believes may confirm an extension of the Raccoon Point Field. Cumulative production from this field, located in Collier County, Florida, has exceeded 9.5 MMBOE. The Company and its partner currently are exploring other 3-D project opportunities within the Sunniland trend by acquiring, reprocessing and analyzing 2-D seismic data along with other evaluation methods. The Company and its partner control approximately 81,000 gross acres in the trend. The Company owns an 8% working interest therein excluding the currently established production.
The Raccoon Point Field is within the Cretaceous Sunniland Trend, which extends from south of Ft. Myers, Florida to northwest of Miami, Florida. Prospective geology in the trend is characterized by carbonate reefs and shoals. The trend's primary historical oil and gas producing formation is the Sunniland formation.
South Louisiana Projects
Four Isle Dome. To March 26, 1997, the Company has identified multiple drilling targets in the upper Miocene zone of Four Isle Dome, located in Terrebone Parish, Louisiana. The first of these wells in which the Company owned a 20% working interest was spud by the Company and its partner, Plains, in October 1996 targeting the upper Miocene at an approximate depth of 14,000 feet. Although the primary objective sands were encountered, electric logs indicated that those sands would not produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The Company also is participating with Plains in an additional well which is currently drilling below 14,000 feet. Prior to the Company's involvement in the project, Plains and its partners acquired a 51-square mile 3-D seismic survey in late 1995. In February 1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with Plains covering Four Isle Dome. Since then, the Company has assisted with completion of the seismic processing, has analyzed the seismic data and has identified drilling targets. The Company and its partner control approximately 19,000 gross acres on this project.
Raceland. The Company and its partner, Texoil, Inc., plan to drill the first exploratory well, targeted at Miocene formations, in the Raceland project during the second quarter of 1997. The Raceland project is located near the Raceland Field in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. Acquisition of a 64-square mile 3-D seismic survey on the underlying salt dome was completed in August 1996 and the Company currently is analyzing the seismic data. The nearby Raceland Field has produced over 24 MMBbls and 134 Bcf from Miocene sands at depths of 7,000 feet to 16,000 feet. The Company and its partner control over 17,000 gross acres in the Raceland project in which the Company owns a 5% working interest.
East Cameron 42. The Company and its partners, Gulf Star Energy, Inc. and Santa Fe Energy Resources, Inc., drilled a gas discovery in Miocene sands on East Cameron 42, the Company's Hollywood project, in July 1996. The well is currently producing in excess of 4.0 MMcfe/d. East Cameron 42 is located in federal waters approximately 175 miles southwest of New Orleans in 45 feet of water. The project acreage is held by production, and the Company owns a 5% working interest in this well.
Other Projects
International Project. The Company joined its partner, Santa Fe Energy Resources (Cote d'Ivoire) Ltd., in January 1997 to evaluate Block CI-24 which consists of 190,000 acres located in the offshore waters of The Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. Pursuant to a production sharing contract the Company and its partner are required to purchase and reprocess existing seismic data which includes an 81 square mile seismic survey and complete an engineering and economic study during a one year evaluation period. Thereafter, if the partnership elects to proceed, the drilling of one exploration well is required during each of two subsequent years. The Company owns a 10% working interest in the project.
Lanell Farms. The Company and its partner, Browning Oil Company, have completed drilling operations on a well at Lanell Farms, located in Gaines County, West Texas, which targeted the Devonian and Wolfcamp formations. With respect to the Wolfcamp formation, the well has been tested at rates greater than 200 Bbls/d.
Production equipment was installed and initial sales began in January 1997. The Company and its partner concluded that the Devonian formation will not produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. A second well, targeting the Wolfcamp formation, is scheduled to spud in the second quarter 1997. The 2,000-acre project area is covered by a 3-D seismic survey in which the Company participated. The Company owns a 6% working interest in the first well and a 10% working interest in the second well to be drilled.
Oil and Gas Reserves
All of the Company's proved reserves described below were located onshore in West Texas and onshore and near-shore in the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast region. All of the Company's proved reserves reflected in the table were proved developed reserves. The Company's estimated total proved reserves of oil and natural gas as of December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, based upon estimates prepared by the Company, were as set forth in the following table:
At December 31, --------------------- 1994 1995 1996 ------ ------ ------ (1) Estimated Net Proved Reserves Data (in thousands): Gas (MMcf)........................... 1,237 443 2,464 Oil and condensate (MBbl)............ 40 41 32 Total equivalent (MMcfe)............. 1,477 689 2,656 Pre-tax present value of proved reserves discounted at 10% (in thousands)(2).......................... $1,606 $ 771 $6,623 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (in thousands)(2)(3)....................... $1,606 $ 771 $6,623
______________
(1) Estimates of the Company's net proved gas and oil and condensate reserves and related revenue estimates as of December 31, 1996 were prepared by the independent engineering consulting firm Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Engineers.
(2) Because the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards, the amounts reflected are the same before taxes and after projected income taxes.
(3) In accordance with requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, represents the present value of estimated future net revenues after income taxes discounted at 10%.
In addition to the discussion below, reference is made to the Financial Statements including the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) included in the notes thereto included elsewhere herein. Such discussion also contains information with respect to the Company's reserves at December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996.
The Company has not included estimates of total proved reserves, comparable to those disclosed herein, in any reports filed with federal authorities or agencies other than the Commission.
At December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company held interests in the following productive wells:
At December 31, ------------------------------------------------------- 1994 1995 1996 ------------------------------------------------------- Gross(1) Net(2) Gross(1) Net(2) Gross(1) Net(2) --------- ------- --------- ------- --------- ------- Oil Wells....... 6 0.06 7 0.16 8 0.31 Gas Wells....... 4 0.56 5 0.74 11 1.71
(1) The number of gross wells equals the total number of wells in which the Company owns a working interest. (2) The number of net wells equals the sum of the Company's fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of the future net revenues therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the subject properties, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices and future operating costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. All such estimates are to some degree speculative and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net revenues expected therefrom, prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Therefore, the actual production, revenues, severance and excise taxes, development and operating expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves will likely vary from such estimates, and such variances could be material.
The Company's producing wells have been producing for only a short period of time. Accordingly, estimates of future production based on this limited history are subject to various uncertainties with regard to the rate at which current production will decline. Estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history, and subsequent evaluation of the same reserves, based upon production history, will result in variations, which may be substantial, in the estimated reserves.
In accordance with applicable requirements of the Commission, the estimated discounted future net revenues from estimated proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate unless such prices or costs are contractually determined at such date. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net revenues also will be affected by factors such as actual production, supply and demand for oil and gas, curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers, changes in governmental regulations or taxation and the impact of inflation on costs.
