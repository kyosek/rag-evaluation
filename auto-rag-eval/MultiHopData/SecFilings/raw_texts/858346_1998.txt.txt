ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO BUILDING
On February 26, 1991, the Company purchased a commercial building, located in Huntington Beach, California.
Constructed in 1991, the building is one-story, has a total of 5,200 rentable square feet and is located on an 18,225 square foot parcel of land. The building is located in Orange County, California, which has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in California, based on its stable base of employers ranging from big businesses to smaller retailers. Management is aware that closures of military bases and aerospace firms could soften the business environment in the Orange County area.
The Building was originally acquired for cash in 1991 for a total acquisition cost of $1,676,210. In February 1994, the Company financed the Building by incurring mortgage debt secured by the Building for $600,000. The loan is amortized over a twenty-five year period and is due February 1, 2004. The monthly payment is currently $4,934 per month with the interest rate set to be adjusted at the end of the fifth year of the loan to 350 basis points above the five-year Treasury Bond yield. The current rate is 8.25%.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 31.5 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and income tax basis for the property are the same. In the opinion of the General Partner, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. ("WCRM"), an affiliate of the Company.
The building is 100% occupied by one tenant, Blockbuster Video, through 2001, on a triple net lease. The tenant's lease calls for rental payments of $11,180 per month for years one through five (1991-1995) and $13,416 per month for years six through ten (1996-2000). This is equivalent to $2.15 and $2.58 per rentable square foot, respectively. This lease requires the tenant to pay insurance, taxes, maintenance, and all other operating costs. The Advisor believes the tenant has the ability to meet its lease obligation.
FRESNO VILLAGE SHOPPING CENTER BUILDING
On May 14, 1993, the Company purchased a free standing commercial building located in a shopping center in Fresno, California.
The Fresno Property is a retail building (the "Fresno Building") with construction completed in April 1993. The Fresno Building is located close to the center of Fresno, California on the northeast corner of Blackstone and McKinley. Fresno is located in Central California. The Fresno Building is located on a lot size of 23,855 square feet, with a building size of 8,915 square feet. The exterior of the Fresno Building consists of stucco and glass construction.
Total consideration paid for the property was $1,414,893. Long-term financing used to acquire the property was $665,000 and matures on August 1, 2003. Monthly payments $5,244 are made at the rate of 8.25% with a twenty-five year amortization schedule. In July 1998, the interest rate on the loan was adjusted to 3.00% above the five-year Treasury Bond yield at that time.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 39 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and tax basis for the property are the same. In the opinion of the Advisor, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by WCRM.
The Fresno Building is 100% occupied by two tenants -- Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc. ("The Wherehouse" - a music and video retailer), and RTO, Inc. (which stands for "Rent To Own" - a home furnishing and appliance rental company) (collectively "Tenants").
As part of a larger neighborhood shopping center anchored by a major department store, all of the tenants are dependent upon the vitality of the consumer market in the general area. Although there are other shopping centers in the area, being located in a densely populated area north of downtown Fresno, and near a large community college, the high daily traffic count provides a large customer base for all the retail and service businesses in the general area. Although all areas of Central California have been affected by the economic slowdown, it has not significantly impacted the occupancy of the Center.
The Wherehouse entered into a ten year lease which commenced April 1, 1993 and was to continue through March 31, 2003. The Wherehouse occupies approximately 6,000 square feet of the Fresno Building.
As possible additional rent, The Wherehouse was scheduled to pay the Company 3% of gross sales after applying a formula that involves recapture of rent and expenses that The Wherehouse would pay as a triple net lease tenant. There were no amounts due on this additional rent through December 31, 1998.
On August 2, 1995, The Wherehouse filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Wherehouse continued to pay its rent under the terms of the original lease through January 1997. In November 1996, the Company and The Wherehouse agreed to the terms of a new lease, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the terms of the First Amendment to Lease (the "Amendment") dated November 30, 1996, commencing February 1, 1997, The Wherehouse's lease was converted from a "net" lease to a "gross" lease and the minimum rent was reduced.
The Company currently receives $82,800 ($6,900 per month) in rental income or $1.15 per square foot per month, plus percentage rent of 8.2% of gross sales per quarter, less certain allowances, minus the rent paid for such period. The Company received $942 in percentage rent for the year ended December 31, 1998.
As a result of the Amendment, the Company absorbed $21,318 in operating expenses in 1998 that were previously allocated to The Wherehouse. The total decrease in income as a result of the Amendment is therefore estimated to be $44,358 per year. Based on approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company outstanding as of December 31, 1998, the Amendment will decrease distributable income by approximately $.015 per share per year, and thus is not material to the operating results of the Company.
OPTO-22 BUILDING
On September 15, 1993, the Company acquired the OPTO-22 Property.
The OPTO-22 Property is located within the master-planned Huntington Beach Industrial Park at 15461 Springdale (at the intersection of Springdale Street and McFadden Avenue), Huntington Beach, California. The Building was built in 1977, and was occupied by a company named OPTO-22 from 1979 through 1992. In August 1992, OPTO-22 subleased the Building to Claremont High School, whose sublease expired in April 1997.
Situated on approximately 3.34 acres of fee land, the Building is concrete tilt-up construction. The Building has approximately 25,866 square feet of fully improved office area, 24 foot high clearance, is fully sprinklered, and has two overhead truck doors as well as one exterior, two-bay truck loading well. In addition, the site contains approximately 201 parking spaces, and has three separate driveway entrances for ingress and egress.
The Huntington Beach Industrial Park is a master-planned development of the Lusk Company. This industrial park contains over 1.5 million square feet of space, and benefits from its close proximity to labor markets and desirable housing as well as access to the San Diego (405) Freeway. Also located within one mile are the Westminster Mall, Golden West Community College, and a McDonnell Douglas Corporation facility.
Total consideration for the OPTO-22 Building paid by the Company was approximately $2,500,000. The purchase price was arrived at through arms-length negotiations with the Seller. The total acquisition cost included $2,350,000 paid to the Seller, approximately $7,000 in legal, appraisal, audit and closing costs, and a $143,000 Acquisition Fee paid to Descolin, Incorporated, an affiliate of the Advisor. Financing of $1,750,000 was obtained from the Seller, with the remainder of the acquisition costs, approximately $779,000, paid in cash. The $1,750,000 financing was in the form of a ten year note, that is being amortized over a thirty year period. The note has an adjustable interest rate that began at approximately 7.0%, and will adjust to three hundred basis points (3.00%) above the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate every year. Payments on the note are currently $12,794 per month.
The OPTO-22 Building is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. ("WCRM") (the "Property Manager"), an affiliate of the Company. WCRM charges the Company 3% of the gross rents collected as a management fee for managing the Property, as allowed by the Property Management Agreement. In the opinion of the Advisor, the OPTO-22 Building is adequately insured.
In August 1998, the Company leased the property to TYR Sports, Inc. an international distributor of swimwear. TYR's headquarters are located adjacent to the property. The Company receives $25,000 per month of rental income and the tenant pays all taxes, insurance and operating expenses. The rent increases to $28,800 per month on August 15, 1999. The lease expires on August 14, 2001 and the tenant has an option to purchase the property for $2,675,000 in the first 4 1/2 months of the year 2000. The tenant also has the right of first refusal to purchase the property through February 15, 2000 and an option to extend the lease for a five year period through August 14, 2006.
In connection with the lease, the tenant was permitted to remove approximately 9,603 square feet of office improvements thereby reducing the total rentable square footage of the building from 63,483 to 53,880 square feet. The reduction decreased the office improvements from 25,866 to 16,263 square feet. The reduction also resulted from the fact that the building was over-improved in the area.
The computation of depreciation is based on the cost of the OPTO-22 Property, including Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the OPTO-22 Property to the various asset categories is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation will be computed on a straight-line basis over 39 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax purposes.
