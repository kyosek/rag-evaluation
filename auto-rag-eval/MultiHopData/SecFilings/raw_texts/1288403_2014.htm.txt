Item 2. Properties
Our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico, Alabama and Texas. The offshore fields are found in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7,200 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically results in high production rates. The reservoirs in our onshore fields are generally characterized as having low porosity and permeability and require stimulation and artificial lift to produce. The following map provides the locations of our 10 largest fields as of December 31, 2014, based on quantities of proved reserves on an energy equivalent basis. At December 31, 2014, these fields accounted for approximately 82% of our proved reserves.
The following table provides information for our 10 largest fields in descending order of proved net reserves as of December 31, 2014, based on quantities on an energy equivalent basis. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water. Our interests in several of our offshore fields are owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, “drilling” in the field descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth, as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SEC’s definition for completion.
(1)
The conversions to barrels of oil equivalent and cubic feet equivalent were determined using the energy equivalency ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.

There has been no production in this field as of December 31, 2014.
Volume measurements:
Bbl - barrels
Mcf - Thousand cubic feet
Boe/d - barrel of oil equivalent per day
Mcfe/d - Thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent per day
Our Fields
On December 31, 2014, we had two fields of major significance (which we define as having year-end proved reserves of 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on an energy equivalent basis). The Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) is located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Below is a description of these fields.
Spraberry Field (Yellow Rose).
The Spraberry field is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We acquired a 100% working interest in approximately 21,900 net acres in connection with the acquisition of properties (the ‘Opal Properties”) from Opal Resources LLC and Opal Resources Operating LLC (collectively, “Opal”) in May 2011. In separate transactions, we acquired approximately 9,500 net acres in 2011 and approximately 2,200 net acres in 2013. We are the operator for these properties. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1935 and extends over several counties in West Texas comprising about 1.6 million acres. The field is 150 miles long and 75 miles wide, and it has undergone much change and expansion over the years, both aerially and vertically. The correlative interval is now over 3,500 feet thick and includes the Clearfork, Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Dean, and Wolfcamp formations. These formations are correlative over the area but are lenticular in nature and vary in thickness, porosity, and permeability even over short distances. The general completion technique includes hydraulic fracturing and installation of sucker rod pumps. During 2014, we drilled 38 wells, which included nine horizontal wells. During 2013, we drilled 32 wells, which included five horizontal wells. During 2012, we drilled 64 wells, which included one horizontal well. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 6.4 MMBoe (38.3 Bcfe) from our wells. In 2015, we plan to drill one horizontal well. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in the Spraberry field were 37.3 MMBoe (223.6 Bcfe) at December 31, 2014, 38.2 MMBoe (229.3 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013 and 31.6 MMBoe (189.8 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012.
The following presents our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes (net to our interests) from the Spraberry field over the past three years.

Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany).
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 37.3 MMBoe gross (223.6 Bcfe gross). This field is a sub-salt development with eight productive horizons below salt at depths up to 17,000 feet. In 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan (the “2010 Development Plan”). As a result, in 2011, we drilled and completed one development well and one exploration well. In 2012, two additional wells were sidetracked, one well was drilled and completed, and another well was drilled to target depth. In 2013, the well reaching target depth in 2012 was completed, one well was drilled and completed and we had one well being drilled. In 2014, the well being drilled in 2013 was completed and we drilled and completed another well. A third well was spud at year end 2014 and, in January 2015, drilling on this well was suspended at an intermediate casing point pending higher crude oil prices. All of the wells drilled under the 2010 Development Plan have been successful. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 18.8 MMBoe (112.9 Bcfe) at December 31, 2014, 22.9 MMBoe (137.7 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013 and 22.7 MMBoe (136.3 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012.
The following presents our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes (net to our interests) from the Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three years.

The following is a description of the remainder of our top 10 properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2014, three of which are located on the conventional shelf and five are located in the deepwater. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of our year-end total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Fairway Field. The Fairway field is comprised of Mobile Bay Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) and located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship in the Fairway field, from Shell in August 2011 and acquired the remaining working interest of 35.7% in September 2014. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2014, six wells have been drilled, one of which was a replacement well. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 125.4 MMBoe gross (752.3 Bcfe gross). This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 47 Bbls of oil per day, 1,696 Bbls of NGLs per day and 25.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 6,065 Boe per day (36.4 MMcfe per day).
Viosca Knoll 783 Field (Viosca Knoll 783 Lease (Tahoe) and Viosca Knoll 784 Lease (SE Tahoe)). The Viosca Knoll 783 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 140 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,500 to 1,700 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll blocks 783 and 784, with subsea tiebacks to two platforms in Main Pass 252. Shell discovered the Tahoe prospect in 1984 and the SE Tahoe prospect in 1996. We acquired a 70% working interest in the Tahoe lease and a 100% working interest in the SE Tahoe lease from Shell in 2010. We are the operator for these properties. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 96.3 MMBoe gross (577.6 Bcfe gross). The Tahoe prospect is a supra-salt (above the salt layer) development with two productive horizons at depths ranging to 10,300 feet. The SE Tahoe prospect is also a supra-salt development with one productive horizon at a depth of 9,325 feet. As of December 31, 2014, 16 wells have been drilled at the Tahoe prospect, eight of which have been successful and one successful well has been drilled at the SE Tahoe prospect. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 212 Bbls of oil per day, 1,362 Bbls of NGLs per day and 18.8 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 4,700 Boe per day (28.2 MMcfe per day).
Mississippi Canyon 243 Field (Matterhorn). Mississippi Canyon 243 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 2,552 feet of water. The field area covers Mississippi Canyon block 243, with a single floating, tension leg production platform on Mississippi Canyon block 243. Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine discovered the field in 2002. We acquired a 100% working interest in the field from Total E&P USA Inc. (“Total E&P”) in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 31.7 MMBoe gross (190.4 Bcfe gross). This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 9,850 feet. As of December 31, 2014, 30 wells have been drilled, 13 of which have been successful. During 2013, we drilled one well, which began production in 2013, and we drilled another well, that had reached target depth but had not yet been completed. During 2014, the well that had reached target depth in 2013 was completed. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 1,553 Bbls of oil per day, 463 Bbls of NGLs per day and 12.2 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 4,051 Boe per day (24.3 MMcfe per day).
Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation and we are the operator for the majority of these properties. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2014, 48 wells have been drilled in this field, 30 of which were successful. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 53.1 MMBoe gross (318.7 Bcfe gross). One new well reached target depth in 2011 and began production in 2012. In addition, one workover was performed in 2012. In 2013, we drilled and completed one well, which began production during 2013. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 118 Bbls of oil per day, 178 Bbls of NGLs per day and 10.7 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 2,086 Boe per day (12.5 MMcfe per day).
Mississippi Canyon 782 Field (Dantzler) Mississippi Canyon 782 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 160 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 6,600 feet of water. The field area covers Mississippi Canyon block 782 and 738. We have a 20% working interest, which is operated by Noble Energy. We, along with Noble Energy, discovered the field in 2013. This field is currently under development as a subsea tieback to the Thunderhawk Field approximately 12 miles to the northwest. The field is a three-way closure trapped against a salt wall. There are two pay horizons, the upper Miocene U5 and U6 sands. As of December 31, 2014, two wells have been drilled, of which both have been successful and are targeted for first production in the first quarter of 2016.
Viosca Knoll 823 Field (Virgo). Viosca Knoll 823 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 125 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,014 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll block 823 and Viosca Knoll block 822, with a single fixed leg production platform on Viosca Knoll block 823. Total E&P discovered the field in 1997. We acquired a 64% working interest in the field from Total E&P in 2010 and we are the operator for this property. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 21.7 MMBoe gross (130.4 Bcfe gross). This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 13,335 feet. As of December 31, 2014, 14 wells have been drilled, 10 of which have been successful. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 128 Bbls of oil per day, 145 Bbls of NGLs per day and 5.2 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1,137 Boe per day (6.8 MMcfe per day).
East Cameron 321. East Cameron 321 field is located approximately 97 miles off the Louisiana coastline in 225 feet of water. Two production facilities, the “A” and “B” platforms, are located on the block. This field has multiple sands that are productive in faulted, structural traps. These sands are Pleistocene Ang B in age. As of December 31, 2014, 76 wells have been drilled of which 58 have been successful. In 2014 we drilled and completed one well. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 94.6 MMBoe gross (567.3 Bcfe) gross. We own a 100% working interest in the field and are the operator of the field. This field is producing at a restricted rate as a result of a damaged departing gas sales line. During January to October 2014, which was prior to the departing gas sales line damage, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 890 Bbls of oil per day and 0.2 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 928 Boe per day (5.6 MMcfe per day).
Main Pass 283. Main Pass 283 field consists of Main Pass blocks 284, 279 and 283 and Viosca Knoll Block 734. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 75 miles east of Venice in 315 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks in 2003, which range from 50% to 100%, in a transaction with ConocoPhillips. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Cristellaria I. Cumulative field production through 2014 is approximately 24.3 MMBoe gross (145.8 Bcfe gross). As of December 31, 2014, 12 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 10 were successful. During December 2014, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 398 Bbls of oil per day, 195 Bbls of NGLs per day and 3.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1,251 Boe per day (7.5 MMcfe per day).
Proved Reserves
Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant and amounts provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 are summarized below and the mix by product was 52% oil, 13% NGLs and 35% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below.
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet of gas equivalent
(1)
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2014. Prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials. For oil, the West Texas Intermediate posted price was used in the calculation and, after adjustments, a price of $91.12 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the oil price using SEC guidance. The NGLs price of $34.63 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was used in the calculation and the adjusted price of $4.27 per Mcf was used in computing the amounts above. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production, development costs and ARO are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2)
Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3)
We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves increased more than production, resulting in a net increase, and were 120.0 MMBoe at December 31, 2014 compared to 117.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2013. The change between periods is a result of extensions and discoveries of 9.7 MMBoe, acquisitions of 6.1 MMBoe and positive net revisions of 4.1 MMBoe, partially offset by 17.6 MMBoe of production. Increases for extensions and discoveries were primarily at Mississippi Canyon 782 (Dantzler) related to two wells and the Spraberry field related to 51 wells. Increases from acquisitions were primarily due to acquiring interests in the Woodside Properties and increasing ownership in the Fairway field. Revisions were impacted by various fields, with the primary changes being increases at the Fairway and Mississippi Canyon 800 fields, partially offset by decreases at the Spraberry and Ship Shoal 349 (Mahogany) fields. See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2014. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our estimates of proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure as of December 31, 2014 are calculated based upon SEC mandated 2014 unweighted average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas benchmark prices, which are substantially above prices realized in December 2014 and January 2015. The prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas have declined substantially since June 2014. The spot price of WTI crude oil has decreased from $107.00 per barrel in the middle of June 2014 to as low as $44.00 per barrel in January 2015. In recent months, Henry Hub spot prices for natural gas have declined to lower than $3.00 per Mcf compared to average prices during 2014 well in excess of $4.00 per Mcf. Sustained lower prices will result in the prices used in our estimates through year-end 2015 being substantially lower, which, absent significant proved reserve additions, will reduce future estimated proved reserve volumes due to lower economic limits and economic return thresholds for undeveloped reserves, as well as impact our quarterly full cost impairment ceiling tests and volume-dependent depletion cost calculations.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2014 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultants, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 26 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 30 years. He has over 37 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 23 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Reservoir Engineering Director has served in that capacity since 2013, as Reservoir Engineering Manager since 2006, and as Staff Reservoir Engineer upon joining the Company in 2004. Prior to joining the Company, he served as a Reservoir Engineer at Shell, then VP of Reservoir Engineering at Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and later as Manager Acquisitions Engineering at Matrix Oil & Gas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from Iowa State University in 1972.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
·
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
·
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
·
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
·
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert Bbl to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2014 were estimated at $865.8 million.
The following table presents our PUDs by field (in MMBoe):

There has been no production at these fields as of December 31, 2014.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our PUDs (in MMBoe):
Volume measurements:
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Activity related to PUDs in 2014:
·
During 2014, we drilled 20 development wells that converted PUDs to proved developed producing reserves (“PDPs”) and spent $149.5 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2014 allowed reclassification of approximately 15% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2013.
·
At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), we drilled and completed 20 development wells, which moved PUDs to PDPs. In addition, PUDs were decreased due to certain wells being evaluated as uneconomic due to performance and for technical reasons. PUDs were increased due to exploration drilling activity, both by us and offset operators. Our drilling activity for 2015 is expected to be lower compared to 2014, then increasing in 2016 and beyond as prices recover.
·
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), we experienced technical difficulties from a cracked casing, which led us to abandon the well. As of December 31, 2014, we were in the process of drilling a new well (the A-18 well) which was expected to convert the undeveloped reserves to PDP’s, but have stacked the rig in the first quarter of 2015 due to substantially reduced oil prices. We plan to commence drilling this well once oil prices recover.
·
The PUDs at our Mississippi Canyon 782 field (Dantzler) were added as a result of drilling activity in 2013 and completion operations in 2014 to classify reserves as proved undeveloped. This field is not operated by us so we are subject to the decisions of the operator. Current plans are to complete the two wells in this field in 2015 that have been drilled to target depth and to begin production in the first quarter of 2016.
·
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), we have elected to add a PUD to replace declining reserves in the field. This decision was made due to the magnitude of the reserve potential. We perceived less risk in a sidetrack of an existing well compared to a major workover to produce these reserves.
Activity related to PUDs in 2013:
·
During 2013, we drilled numerous development wells that converted PUDs to PDPs and spent $270.4 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2013 allowed reclassification of approximately 47% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2012.
·
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), we drilled and completed the SS 359 A14 BP2 well, which resulted in the conversion of all of the PUDs existing at 2012 to PDPs in 2013. The SS 359 A14 BP2 well was the fifth well drilled under our 2010 Development Plan. As of December 31, 2013, we were in the process of drilling our sixth well (SS 359 A015) under this multi-well program. This multi-well program is expected to continue into 2014 and beyond. Also, as a result of our successful drilling program, one new PUD location was added during 2013.
·
The PUDs at our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) and our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo) were obtained through acquisitions in 2010. We drilled and completed one development well (MC 243 A2 ST2 BP2) at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), which moved PUDs to PDPs. Also, one new PUD location was added during 2013. Development of these two fields is expected to continue into future years.
·
PUDs at our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) were obtained primarily through an acquisition in 2011. We drilled and completed 33 development wells, which moved PUDs to PDPs. In addition, PUDs were decreased due to certain wells being evaluated as uneconomical due to performance and for technical reasons. PUDs were increased due to exploration drilling activity, both by us and other companies, and also from additions related to 40 acre down-spacing. Our drilling plans for 2014 include an active drilling program in the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) and we expect to continue our drilling activity beyond 2014.
·
In the High Island 21/22 field, we drilled and completed the HI 0021 A1 BP1 well, which initially resulted in the conversion of all the PUDs to PDPs. Subsequently, these PDPs were removed from proved reserves due to well performance.
·
The additional PUDs at the Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend) were from our joint interest ownership in the non-operated field and are related to the MC 698 #1 well, which was drilled in 2012.
Activity related to PUDs in 2012:
·
During 2012, we drilled numerous development wells that converted PUDs to PDPs and spent $263.6 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2012 allowed reclassification of approximately 58% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2011.
·
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), we completed one well, (SS 359 A5 ST) and two additional wells were side tracked. As of December 31, 2012, we were in the process of completing the SS 359 A9 ST well, which moved additional reserves from PUDs to PDPs.
·
We completed one well (MC 243 A4 ST) at Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) in 2012.
·
At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), we completed 53 development wells and 11 exploration wells. One of the wells completed was a horizontal well and two other horizontal wells reached target depth in 2012, which proved the concept and allowed additional horizontal PUD locations to be booked. Additionally, wells completed in 2011 and 2012 proved that the concept of down spacing to 40-acres was viable in a portion of the field, allowing the conversion of certain unproven locations to PUDs in 2012.
·
In the High Island 21/22 field, a field study demonstrated that additional reserves could be recovered by drilling a replacement for a well that had experienced a mechanical failure. This allowed unproved reserves in 2011 to be reclassified as proved reserves in 2012.
See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
We believe that we will be able to develop all but 1.4 MMBoe of the reserves classified as PUDs, or approximately 96%, out of the total of 36.7 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31, 2014, within five years from the date such reserves were initially recorded. The exception is at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) where the field is being developed using a single floating tension leg platform requiring an extended sequential development plan. The platform cannot support a rig that would allow additional wells to be drilled, but can support a rig to allow sidetracking of wells. These PUDs were originally recorded in our reserves as of December 31, 2010. The development of the 1.4 MMBoe of PUDs will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. Based on the latest reserve report, a well is expected to be drilled to develop the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) PUDs in 2020.
Our capital budget for 2015 for development is approximately $120 million. The capital allocated to our development activities will assist us in converting the PUDs to PDPs. A recovery in crude oil prices could lead to an increase in development expenditures.
Acreage
The following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2014. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 58% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 62% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. Within the onshore net acreage, the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) is approximately 90% developed and all the other onshore prospects combined are approximately 17% developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, 59,498 net acres (20%) of the total 290,588 net undeveloped offshore acres could expire in 2015, 35,965 net acres (12%) could expire in 2016, 79,180 net acres (28%) could expire in 2017, 52,121 net acres (18%) could expire in 2018, and 63,824 net acres (22%) could expire in 2019 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, 10,612 net acres (67%) of the total 15,749 net undeveloped onshore acres could expire in 2015 and 5,088 net acres (33%) could expire in 2016. Within the onshore net undeveloped acreage, the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) comprises 2,486 net acres and the other onshore prospects comprise the remaining 13,263 acres of the total 15,749 net acres. The expiration of the onshore undeveloped acreage may be extended through the purchase of new leasehold rights or extension of leasehold rights, but these potential arrangements were not contractual rights as of December 31, 2014. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2015 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net offshore acreage decreased 39,067 net acres (5%) from December 31, 2013 and our net onshore acreage decreased 141,170 net acres (77%) from December 31, 2013. The decrease in our net onshore acreage was primarily due to reassigning acres back to our original assignor at our Star Project in East Texas.
Production
For the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, our net daily production averaged 48.3 MBoe, 49.3 MBoe and 46.8 MBoe, respectively. Production decreased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an out of period adjustment of 0.9 MBoe/day recorded in 2013, natural production declines, production deferrals and divestitures, partially offset by acquisitions and new production. Production increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to acquisitions and increases in the Ship Shoal 349 field attributable to development activities and the out of period adjustment, partially offset by natural production declines and production deferrals. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three years.
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Refer to the descriptions of our 10 largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) and Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany) over the past three fiscal years, each of which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 in this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2014 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest.
(1)
Includes 11 gross (9.0 net) oil wells and nine gross (5.8 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 in our onshore operations. In 2014, we increased the onshore horizontal drilling activity compared to 2013, which take longer to drill and are more expensive on a per well basis compared to vertical wells. Our onshore drilling activity is primarily in the Spraberry field, which was acquired by acquisition in May 2011, coupled with additional leasehold interests acquired in 2011 and 2013.
The tables below are based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine productive wells drilled.
Development Drilling
The following table sets forth information related to our development wells drilled over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross development wells drilled was 100% in each of the last three years.
Exploration Drilling
The following table sets forth information related to our exploration drilling over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross exploration wells drilled during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 100%, 89% and 96%, respectively.
Recent Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth 2015 drilling activity to February 15, 2015.
As of February 15, 2015, we were in the process of drilling and/or completing on a gross well basis five offshore exploration wells, six onshore exploration wells and five onshore development wells.
Capital Expenditures
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for capital expenditures information.
