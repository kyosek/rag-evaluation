* Reflects Company ownership of generation resources and, therefore, does not include firm purchases or sales.
The Company entered into a contract with New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, with a term of May 24, 1993 through April 29, 1995, for the purchase of energy and capacity of up to 300 MW. During 1993, the Company purchased 920,000 MWh of energy under this contract.
The Company has a contract with PASNY which entitles the Company to 49 MW net capability from the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Plant through 2002.
Since 1975, the Company has purchased capacity in relatively small amounts from the Fitzpatrick Nuclear Plant of PASNY, pursuant to a contract which may be terminated by either party on 12 months' notice. Under such contract, the maximum capacity which can be purchased during specific periods is 6 MW.
See Item 1, subcaption "Regulation - Alternative Electric Power Generation," with respect to alternative electric power generation interconnected with the Company's system.
The Company owns 89 substations having an aggregate transformer capacity of 4.3 million KVA. The transmission system consists of 584 pole miles of line and the distribution system of 7,224 pole miles of overhead lines and 783 trench miles of underground lines.
Load and Capacity: The Company's maximum one-hour demand within its own territory, for the year ended December 31, 1993, occurred on July 15, 1993 and amounted to 860 MW. The Company's maximum one-hour demand within its own territory, for that part of the 1993-1994 winter capability period through March 15, 1994, occurred on January 26, 1994 and amounted to 845 MW.
Based on current projections of peak one-hour demands for the three-year period comprising the 1994 summer capability period through the winter capability period of 1996-1997, the Company estimates that it will have capacity available to satisfy its projected peak demands plus the estimated reserve generating capacity requirements which it is required to maintain as a member of the New York Power Pool ("NYPP"), described below. The following table sets forth the amounts of any excess capacity by summer and winter capability periods for such three-year period:
Excess of Capacity over Forecasted Peak + Available Peak Plus NYPP Capability Peak Reserve Capacity Reserve Requirements Period (MW) (MW)* (MW) (MW) Percent
1994 Summer 840 991 1,092.9 101.9 9.3 1994-95 Winter 760 991 1,152.9 161.9 14.0 1995 Summer 820 968 1,122.9 154.9 13.8 1995-96 Winter 765 968 1,182.9 214.9 18.2 1996 Summer 820 968 1,152.9 184.9 16.0 1996-97 Winter 770 968 1,212.9 251.9 20.8
* Summer period peak plus reserve requirements carry over to the following winter period.
The foregoing table reflects the following:
(1) reduction in capacity requirements as a result of the Company's Energy Efficiency Programs described above in Item 1 under the subcaption "Regulation - Energy Efficiency Programs," (2) the decreases in IBM related electric sales and revenues (as described above in Item 1 under the subcaption "Rates - Rate Proceedings - Electric and Gas") and (3) effective with the 1994-1995 Winter - Capability Period, the capacity represented by the interests in the Roseton Plant proposed to be purchased by the Company from Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation ("Niagara Mohawk") under the "Amendment" (as described below under the subcaption "Roseton Plant").
The Company is a member of the NYPP consisting of the major investor-owned electric utility companies in the State and PASNY. The members of the NYPP, by agreement, provide for coordinated operation of their bulk power electric systems with a view to the use of the most economical source of electricity, for the maintenance of a reserve margin equal to at least 18% of each member's forecasted peak load and for the sale and interchange of electric generating capability and energy among such members. The members of the NYPP also provide for the cooperative development of long-range plans for the expansion on an integrated basis of the bulk power supply system for New York State, compatible with environmental standards, and appropriately related to interstate and international capacity and reliability considerations.
Roseton Plant: The Roseton Plant is located in the Company's franchise area at Roseton, New York, and is owned by the Company, Con Edison and Niagara Mohawk as tenants-in-common. The Roseton Plant, placed in commercial operation in 1974, has a generating capacity of 1,200 MW consisting of two 600 MW generating units, both of which are capable of being fired either by residual oil or natural gas (see subcaption below entitled "Gas - Sufficiency of Supply and Future Gas Supply"). The Company is acting as agent for the owners with respect to operation of the Roseton Plant. Generally, the owners share the costs and expenses of the operation of such Plant in accordance with their respective ownership interests.
In March 1993, Unit No. 2 of the Roseton Plant went out of service because of extensive damage to that Unit and related facilities caused by fire. No injury to personnel was involved. Some non-hazardous mineral oil spillage also occurred into a tributary of the Hudson River. No customer service interruptions occurred. Appropriate governmental agencies, including the PSC, the U.S. Coast Guard and the NYSDEC were contacted. Unit No. 1 of the Roseton Plant was taken out of service due to less extensive damage to that Unit. Unit No. 1 was returned to service in May 1993 and Unit No. 2 was returned to service in December 1993. Total restoration costs are approximately $32 million, most of which will be recovered through insurance.
Pursuant to an agreement among the cotenant owners of the Roseton Plant, dated October 1, 1968, and thereafter amended ("Roseton Plant Agreement"), Con Edison owns 40% of such Plant, Niagara Mohawk owns 25% of such Plant and the Company owns 35% of such Plant, all as tenants-in-common. The Company, under the Roseton Plant Agreement, has an option to purchase the interests of Con Edison and Niagara Mohawk in the Roseton Plant in December 2004 at a purchase price based upon fair value within specified limits of amortized costs. The exercise of such option by the Company is subject to approval by the PSC and may be subject to the statutory standards and/or competitive bidding requirements described in Item 1 above under the caption "Regulation - Least- Cost Generation Supply."
In order to satisfy then anticipated requirements for additional generating capacity starting in the mid-1990s, in 1987 the Company and Niagara Mohawk entered into an agreement ("Amendment") which revises the option of the Company to purchase the interest of Niagara Mohawk in the Roseton Plant under the Roseton Plant Agreement. The Company's option to buy Con Edison's interest in the Roseton Plant is not affected by the Amendment. The Amendment is subject to PSC approval, and in the event such approval is not obtained, the Amendment is cancelled and the parties return to their same positions under the Roseton Plant Agreement.
Pursuant to the Amendment, Niagara Mohawk will sell to the Company a 2.5% interest in the Roseton Plant on December 31, 1994 and on each succeeding December 31, through and including December 31, 2003, which will constitute all of Niagara Mohawk's interest in the Roseton Plant. In exchange, Niagara Mohawk will have the option to repurchase from the Company up to a 25% interest in the Roseton Plant in December 2004. The prices for the purchases will be based on the depreciated book cost of the Roseton Plant assuming straight-line amortization to provide for a fully amortized facility as of December 31, 2009. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company has the option to repurchase Niagara Mohawk's remaining interest in the Roseton Plant when such Plant reaches the end of its assumed physical life as agreed upon by the parties to the Amendment.
In July 1988, the PSC established a proceeding to consider a joint petition filed by the Company and Niagara Mohawk requesting the PSC to approve the transfers of interests in the Roseton Plant contemplated by the Amendment. In May 1989, the Company and the PSC Staff reached a Stipulation Agreement indicating that, giving consideration to expected demand-side management activities, the proposed transfers of interest of the Roseton Plant under the Amendment were one alternative which would meet the Company's future needs for power. The PSC has not yet acted on such petition. The Company continues to consider other alternatives to the Amendment.
The 345 Kv transmission lines and related facilities to connect the Roseton Plant with other points in the system of the Company and with the systems of Con Edison and Niagara Mohawk to the north and west of such Plant are 100%-owned by the Company. The share of each of the parties in the output of the Roseton Plant is transmitted over these lines pursuant to a certain transmission agreement relating to such Plant, which provides, among other things, for compensation to the Company for such use by the other parties. In addition, the Company has contract rights which entitle the Company to the lesser of 300 MW or one quarter of the capacity in a 345 Kv transmission line owned by PASNY which connects the Roseton Plant with a Con Edison substation to the east of such Plant in East Fishkill, New York. In exchange for these rights, the Company agreed to provide PASNY capacity in the 345 Kv transmission lines the Company owns from the Roseton Plant, to the extent it can do so after satisfying its obligations to Con Edison and Niagara Mohawk.
Nine Mile 2 Plant:
General: Unit No. 2 of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station ("Nine Mile 2 Plant" or "Plant") is located in Oswego County, New York, and is operated by Niagara Mohawk. The Nine Mile 2 Plant is owned as tenants-in-common by the Company (9% interest), Niagara Mohawk (41% interest), New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (18% interest), Long Island Lighting Company (18% interest) and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation (14% interest). The output of the Nine Mile 2 Plant, which has a nominally rated net capability of 1,080 MW, is shared, and the operating expenses of and capital additions to the Plant are allocated to the cotenants, in the same proportions as the cotenants' respective ownership interests.
An Operating Agreement for the operation of the Plant was entered into by the Nine Mile 2 Plant cotenants effective January 1, 1993, and the PSC approved said Operating Agreement on February 24, 1994. Under that Agreement, Niagara Mohawk operates the Nine Mile 2 Plant, but all five owners shared certain policy, budget and managerial oversight functions. The fixed term of such Operating Agreement is 24 months from its effective date and, unless terminated on the expiration of such 24 month period, continues, subject to termination on six months' notice.
In August 1989, the non-operating cotenants of the Nine Mile 2 Plant entered into an agreement for consulting services with Management, Analytical & Technical Services, Inc. ("MATS") concerning the monitoring and assessment of the operation of the Plant, including the provision of technical advice, with the objective of improving the operation of the Plant. Pursuant to such agreement, MATS is acting as the on-site representative of the non-operating cotenants.
Operational Matters:
NRC and INPO Monitoring: On September 28, 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") issued its latest systematic assessment of licensee performance ("SALP") review of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station for the period May 24, 1992 to August 14, 1993 ("1992/93 SALP Report"). The Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station is comprised of Units No. 1 and No. 2, Unit No. 1 being located adjacent to the Nine Mile 2 Plant and owned and operated solely by Niagara Mohawk and Unit No. 2 being the Nine Mile 2 Plant. The 1992/93 SALP Report, conducted under the revised SALP process that was implemented by the NRC on July 19, 1993, rates licensee performance in four functional areas: Operations, Maintenance, Engineering and Plant Support.
Overall, the NRC indicated that it continues to see improved performance at the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station. According to the NRC, Niagara Mohawk's management demonstrated a proactive and proper safety perspective and excellent oversight, control and involvement in and support of activities at such Station. Due to the change in the NRC's revised SALP process, direct comparisons to previous SALP reports are not available in all areas.
Operations was rated Category 2 ("good"), which was the same rating as on the prior SALP Report (covering the period April 1991 through May 23, 1992).
Maintenance was rated Category 2 ("good"), up from Category 2 "with a declining trend" in said prior SALP Report.
Engineering was rated Category 1 ("excellent"), up from Category 2 in said prior SALP Report.
Plant Support was rated Category 2 ("good"). Plant Support is a new functional area covering all activities related to plant support functions, including Radiological Controls, Emergency Preparedness, Security, Chemistry, Fire Protection and House Keeping Controls.
The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations ("INPO"), an industry sponsored oversight group, conducted evaluations of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station during the weeks of May 17 and 24, 1993. Niagara Mohawk informed the Company that the INPO Report was generally favorable, however, there were some areas in need of improvement. Niagara Mohawk reports that it has responded to INPO with its intent to correct any problem areas. INPO evaluations are conducted at twelve (12) to eighteen (18) month intervals.
Radioactive Waste: For a discussion of the low-level and high-level radioactive waste management programs at the Nine Mile 2 Plant, see the caption "Radioactive Waste" in Note 2 to the Company's 1993 Financial Statements appearing on pages 46 and 47 of Exhibit 13 hereto, which caption is incorporated herein by reference.
Refueling Outage: A scheduled refueling outage for the Nine Mile 2 Plant commenced on October 2, 1993. Such refueling outage was completed on November 29, 1993 and full plant output was achieved on December 3, 1993.
Gas
General: The Company's gas system consists of 156 miles of transmission pipelines and 923 miles of distribution pipelines.
Current Gas Supply: During 1993, natural gas was available to firm gas customers at a price competitive with that of alternative fuels. As compared to 1992, in 1993, firm retail gas sales, normalized for weather, increased by 1% and the average number of firm gas customers increased by 1.9%. Sales to interruptible customers decreased 37.4% in 1993 as compared to 1992.
For information on the Company's gas suppliers and gas storage capability, see the caption "Natural Gas Supply" in Note 9 to the Company's 1993 Financial Statements appearing on pages 63 and 64 of Exhibit 13, which caption is incorporated herein by reference.
For the year ended December 31, 1993, the total amount of gas purchased from all sources was 18,293,178 Mcf., which includes 1,940,214 Mcf. purchased directly for use as a boiler fuel at the Roseton Plant.
The Company owns two propane-air mixing facilities for emergency and peak shaving purposes located in Poughkeepsie and in Newburgh, New York. Each facility is capable of supplying 8,000 Mcf. per day with propane storage capability adequate to provide maximum facility sendout for up to three consecutive days.
Sufficiency of Supply and Future Gas Supply: The peak daily demand for natural gas by the Company's customers for the year ended December 31, 1993 occurred on February 6, 1993, and amounted to 100,774 Mcf. The Company's peak-day gas capability in 1993 was 116,865 Mcf. The peak daily demand for natural gas by the Company's customers for that part of the 1993-1994 heating season through March 15, 1994, occurred on January 27, 1994 and amounted to 113,033 Mcf.
Other: In late 1985, FERC instituted a rule which permits non-discriminatory access to the pipeline facilities of interstate gas pipeline transmission companies subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act. This rule allows access to such pipelines by the pipeline transmission company's customers enabling them to transport gas purchased directly from third parties and spot sources through such pipelines. Such access, moreover, also permits industrial customers of gas distribution utilities to connect directly with the pipeline transmission company and to contract directly with the pipeline transmission companies to transport gas, thereby by-passing the distribution utility. In 1985, the PSC issued its Opinion and Order requiring New York State distribution gas utilities to transport customer-owned gas through its facilities upon request of a customer. Except in the Towns of Carmel, Pleasant Valley, New Baltimore, Coxsackie, Athens, Milan, Clinton, LaGrange and Unionvale, currently, no interstate pipeline transmission companies are located in areas where the Company provides retail gas service.
For a discussion of FERC Order 636, issued in 1992, and thereafter amended, which requires pipeline gas suppliers to unbundle natural gas sales service from transportation and storage service, see the caption "Natural Gas Supply" in Note 9 to the Company's 1993 Financial Statements appearing on pages 63 and 64 of Exhibit 13 hereto, which caption is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company is a member of the New York Gas Group ("NYGAS"), a voluntary association of utilities providing gas service in New York State. The purpose of NYGAS is to achieve, by cooperative action among gas distributors, greater efficiency in meeting present demands for gas service in New York State and to develop state-wide gas sufficiency to support future economic growth throughout the State.
Other Matters
The Danskammer Plant and the Roseton Plant and all of the other principal generating plants and important property units of the Company are held by it in fee simple, except (1) certain rights-of-way, and (2) a portion of the property used in connection with the hydroelectric plants of the Company consisting of flowage or other riparian rights. The Company's present interests in the Roseton Plant and the Nine Mile 2 Plant are owned as undivided interests as a tenant-in-common with the other utility owners thereof. Certain of the properties of the Company are subject to rights-of-way and easements which do not interfere with the Company's operations. In the case of certain distribution lines, the Company owns only a part interest in the poles upon which its wires are installed, the remaining interest being owned by telephone companies. Certain electric transmission facilities owned by others are used by the Company pursuant to long-term contractual arrangements.
All of the physical properties of the Company (other than property, such as material and supplies, excluded in the Company's Mortgage) and its franchises are subject to the lien of the Company's Mortgage under which all of its Mortgage Bonds are outstanding. Such properties are from time to time subject to liens for current taxes and assessments which it is the Company's practice to pay regularly as and when due.
The Company's properties have been well maintained and are in good operating condition.
During the three-year period ended December 31, 1993, the Company made gross property additions of $186.7 million and property retirements and adjustments of $35.8 million, resulting in a net increase (including Construction Work in Progress) in utility plant of $150.9 million, or 12.5%
