Surface Rights: According to Dominican mining law the surface rights owner or land owners have no rights to the sub-surface of minerals under their property. These are owned by the sovereign state who may grant concessions to explore and mine the sub-surface. The Company has not acquired or contracted any of the surface rights at this time because the area of the exploration concession applications is vast and the cost would be prohibitive until such time as potential mineral resources have been confirmed. Access to the exploration concession application area to conduct surface exploration and geochemical sampling is generally granted by the individual owners. Should a viable mineral reserve be discovered, the area is usually a fraction of the entire exploration concession area, and only the mineralized area would need to be contracted and not the entire concession. Again it is extremely rare that surface exploration on the land of the individual owners be denied.
The countryside is mostly low production pastoral or mountain grazing land and agreements to purchase, lease or royalty contract this type of land is positively received. The Dominican Mining law requires the land owner is fairly compensated to the appraised value of the surface land even in the case of expropriation.
ALEXIA
Location: The “ALEXIA CLAIM”, is located in the province of Dajabon, in the municipalities of Dajabon and Partido, specifically in the sections Chaucey, La Gorra and Partido Arriba, covering Los Indios, Pueblo Nuevo, Hatico Viejo, El Junco, La Gallina, Tahuique and Charo located in the Dajabon 5874-I (11) and Loma de Cabrera 5874-II (19) topographical sheets,complying with the terms of mining law No. 146 and its regulations. The Alexia Claim is located approximately 3.5 hours northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo by car and immediately north of the town of Partido. The Alexia Claim has good asphalt paved road access and an internal network of graded clay roads. The total area covered by the exploration request is 2,775 mining hectares.
Boundary: The ALEXIA Claim boundaries will follow the direction of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid, on vertices with incoming and outgoing angles of 90o, according to that outlined in the following table:
The data for the preparation of the map for this exploration Claim was taken from the topographic sheet named Dajabon 5874-I (11) and Loma de Cabrera 5874-II (19) on a scale of 1:50,000.
Type of Ownership: One hundred percent (100%) of the Alexia exploration concession application was acquired by the Company from Gexplo SRL via a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement dated July 30, 2012. The property was duly transferred by way of the “Alexia Mining Concession Transfer Contract”. The transfer was signed and notarized on19 September 2012 and deposited at the Dominican Mining Office (DGM) registry office for recording on November 23, 2012, to be processed. . The original transfer documents required the additional word “Application” in the document headings and were signed and notarized on 13th September 2013 and re-deposited at the Dominican Mining Office (DGM) registry office for recording on 13th Nov 2013 to be processed.
Claim Rights: In the Dominican Republic mineral rights are obtained by filing a 30 day claim with the DGM. During this 30 day period the stake holder has the exclusive right to apply for an exploration concession which is valid for three years and may be renewed for two consecutive 1 year periods. Finally, the holder may apply for an exploitation concession which is valid for 25 years with two 25 year renewal periods totaling 75 years. Surface rights are not included and are negotiated separately with the landowner. In the event a landowner will not provide access to the concession the applicant may request the DGM expropriation the property at fair market price. All claims including 30 day, exploration applications, exploration concessions, exploitation applications and exploitation concessions can be sold, transferred, mortgaged, leased, rented, etc.
Type of Claim or Rights: Alexia is classified as an exploration concession application and is in the final stages of processing at the DGM. The Alexia exploration concession is prospective for both placer and lode exploration. Some preliminary scoping and sampling has been performed by a Santo Mining geologist.
Claim Identification: The Alexia exploration concession application was first registered at DGM by Gexplo SRL, the prior owner, on 3 August 2010 and is identified solely by its name “Alexia”.
Claim Status at DGM: Completed and remaining processes in order to grant the exploration concession:
· DGM Correction Letters from Legal, Auditing and Surveying: All Completed.
· Two Public Notices of Claim Application in National Newspaper: Completed.
· Field Inspection of Survey Monuments: Pending scheduling. Verification the concession survey monuments are installed correctly. Applicant required to check monuments prior to verification. Estimated time to complete 1-3 months. Cost $465 plus mileage.
· Exploration Concession Document Drafted by DGM: Usually no further requirements by applicant. Estimated time to complete 3-6 months. No Cost.
· Granting of Exploration Concession by Ministry of Mines and Energy: Usually no further requirements by applicant. Estimated time to complete 6-12 months. Cost/Official Fee $1,220.
It is noted that there has been historical backlog in processing exploration concession applications and claim transfers at DGM. Recently the mining sector has seen general improvements in processing under the new DGM leadership together with a departmental budget increase, staff changes and more efficient methods.
Work Completed and Condition: In 2012 the Santo Mining exploration team conducted a reconnaissance survey and preliminary stream sediment geochemical stream sediment survey of the 2,775 hectare area. Later in 2012 a second reconnaissance of the area was conducted by geologist Salvador Brouwer. To date 12 stream sediment samples have been collected which were bagged, tagged, sealed and delivered to secure storage in Santo Domingo. 8 samples were delivered to Acme Laboratories in Maimon where they were dried, crushed (or sieved in the case of soils) and pulped. The processed samples were then sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver Canada (an ISO 9001 accredited facility) where they were crushed to 80% passing 2mm and split using a riffle splitter. A 250 gram sub-sample split was crushed to minus 200 mesh (74µ) and a 15 gram sub-split from the resulting pulp was then subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP-MS analysis. The unused splits were returned to Santo Domingo for storage. The streams proved to be contaminated and no anomalies were identified. The exploration team plans to return to the area in 2013 for more detailed exploration.
Geology: The Alexia Claim area is dominated mainly by tonalitic intrusives of upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous age and by Dioritic and Gabbroic intrusive of similar age to the Tonalites. Both intruded the Duarte Complex and are in tectonic contact with rock of the upper Cretaceous Tireo Formation. This Tireo volcanic are present in the Concession in elongated NW-SE narrow strips in tectonic contact with the intrusives. A tectonized sliver of ultramafic rocks seems to allochthonous to the area probably pushed up to its present location by trusting. Younger rocks of Cercado Fm. and the Bulla conglomerates occupy the Southwestern corner of the Concession.
Total Costs to Date & Future Cost: Costs to date are: Manpower $6,000, Logistics and Equipment $3,300, Acme Labs $650, Overhead $5,300. Total Costs to Date: $15,250. Budget estimate to complete geophysical investigation/interpretation, 300m trenching, 1,200 meters diamond core drilling, Laboratory analyses and preparation of a NI-43-101 / SEC equivalent report is $210,000.
Utilities and Infrastructure: Electrical service and water are available throughout the property. The exploration area is either hilly pastoral to remote mountainous laced with extensive drainage system of rivers and streams interspersed with ponds and small lakes all of which can be used for future core drilling and supply various processes. There is an extensive electrical power grid in Dominican and or a mining operation would generate its own electrical power.
Disclosure: At this time the Alexia property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature.
WALTER
Location and Access: The Walter Claim is situated in the central region of the country, located in the Sánchez Ramírez province, municipality of Cotui. More precisely 5 kms east of the town of Maimón, 15 kms east of Piedra Blanca and approximately 45 minutes northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo. It has good asphalt paved road access and an internal network of graded clay roads and is marked on the USGS Hatillo topographic map number 6172-I, on a scale of 1:50,000; the boundaries are at coordinates UTM (19Q): 2'090,000 - 2'091,000 N and 370,500 - 372,500 E.
Boundary: The WALTER Claim boundaries will follow the direction of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid on vertices with incoming and outgoing angles of 90o, according to that outlined in the following table:
Stratigraphy - Maimón Formation - Owes its name to the Maimón village mapped by Bowin (1960, 1966). Mercier de Lepinay (1987), and Boisseau (1987) explain this formation as an integral part of the metamorphic base of the island. The Maimón formation is presented as a band of some 300 km in length and between 5 and 15 km wide that extends in a NW-SE direction. The Maimón schists form the northern flank of the Metamorphic Intermediate Belt (Bowin, 1960, 1966) and by extension, of the Central Mountain Range.
Geologic map of the Walter Claim: From a lithological point of view, this unit consists of a group of schistose rocks, predominantly volcanic with sedimentary interspersing, that present a variable grade of deformation and metamorphism. The chemical analyses of representative lithology’s range from basaltic to cuarzoqueratóficas compositions. All are highly related to Fe/Mg and with low K content. This formation is separated in the south from the Loma Caribe and Peralvillo Sur formations by a band of mylonites that are considered associated to a transpressive fault, and separated in the north from the Los Ranchos formation (that have as a sedimentary cover incongruous with the Hatillo and Las Lagunas formations) by the Hatillo thrusting. This formation small to large sized diorite bodies intrusions, principally in its southern area, without encountering foliation of these intrusions. Most of the surface is covered by quaternary fluvial sediments with numerous rock outcrops in the five creeks that meander through the area. The sediments are estimated to be 10 deep and the underlying bedrock is Maimón Schist, a bimodal metalvolcanic formation. Foliation is well developed and hydrothermal alterations were observed in The Lajas and Guaré creeks. On the banks of the Guaré Creek exits the remains of a Colonial Spanish Smelter where copper carbonates were observed probably originating from ore mined at the Loma La Mina deposit, 2 km north. According to Brouwer this concession has considerable potential of finding Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposits.
Mineral Deposits: The area of the Intermediate Belt can be considered favorable land for the occurrence of two types of metallic mineralization according to its origin:
· In the first place, the mineralization related to the end of the volcanism of the island arc. These mineralizations are located in the Maimón and Los Ranchos formations, presenting generally as disseminated sulfide complexes, with variable proportions of elements Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe; associated with these elements are silica and sulfur as final products of a magmatic differentiation by chemical affinity.
· In second place, the existing mineralization in the Maimón formation is considered, with evidence at Cerro Maimón and Loma Potrero. These deposits correspond to the mineralization model in massive submarine basalts of the MORB type with associated sulfides.
Volcano-sedimentary mineralization of Cu-Zn (Au, Ag): Mainly in the Maimón formation, there appear diverse stratiformic bodies of massive sulfides of low potency and tonnage, though with appreciable longitudinal development, and are related to acidic volcaniclastic rocks in the intermediate. They are of a pyritic composition and have Cu as a main substance of economic interest, with variable concentrations of Au and Zn; the Pb tends to be very scarce. They usually develop a hydrothermal alteration which is fundamentally of the silicification-chloritization type. Powerful ferruginous caps have developed on some of them.
Copper fits in its distribution to the Maimón formation, while the Los Ranchos formation shows lower sources of copper. Part of the distribution patterns of copper are due to overlapping of deposits responses. This explains content in large areas that exceed 100 ppm of Cu.

It is noted that there has been historical backlog in processing exploration concession applications and claim transfers at DGM. Recently the mining sector has seen general improvements in processing under the new DGM leadership together with a departmental budget increase, staff changes and more efficient methods.
Work Completed and Condition: Since September 2012 the Santo Mining exploration team has conducted a series of surface geochemical survey of the 200 hectare area of the Walter Exploration Concession Application. Preliminary reconnaissance was conducted by geologist Salvador Brouwer who collected rock and sediment samples at confluences and exit points. Later he supervised an active stream sediment sampling expedition conducted by geologist Professor Luz Iris Contreras who sampled the entire concession drainage basin at 100 meter spacing. Beginning in early 2013 staff geologist Elpidio Moronta assisted by seasoned gold scout Ramoncito Vasquez conducted a series of geochemistry soil sampling surveys starting on a 100 m grid and ending on a 25 m grid in areas anomalous for precious and base metals. To date over 350 samples have been collected and 300 bagged, tagged, sealed and delivered to secure storage in Santo Domingo. A total of 251 samples were delivered to Acme Laboratories in Maimon where they were dried, crushed (or sieved in the case of soils) and pulped. The processed samples were then sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver Canada (an ISO 9001 accredited facility) where they were crushed to 80% passing 2mm and split using a riffle splitter. A 250 gram sub-sample split was crushed to minus 200 mesh (74µ) and a 15 gram sub-split from the resulting pulp was then subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP-MS analysis. The unused splits were returned to Santo Domingo for storage. Several potential precious and base metal anomalies were identified from the suite Acme analyses and shallow diamond core drill targets have been defined.
Total Costs to Date & Future Cost: Costs to date are: Manpower $29,000, Logistics and Equipment $6,000, Acme Labs Analysis 8,800.00, Overhead 15,000. Total Costs to Date: $58,800. Budget estimate to complete geophysical investigation/interpretation, 2,000 meters shallow drilling, Laboratory analyses and preparation of a NI-43-101 / SEC equivalent report is $155,000.
Utilities and Infrastructure: Electrical service and water are available throughout the property.

MARIA
Location and Access: The Maria Claim is situated in the central region of the Dominican Republic, located between the La Vega and Monseñor Nouel provinces in the municipalities of Jima Abajo, La Vega and Bonao. The Claim is located in the area of the village of Rincón and can be found in the Fantino USGS Topographic Map number 6173-II, on a scale of 1:50,000. The boundaries are defined by the UTM (19Q): 2011000 - 2016000 North and 348000 - 352000 East coordinates. The total area covered by the exploration request is 1,486 mining hectares.
Fig. No.1.- Geographic location of the Maria Mining Claim,
The principal access route to the Claim is the National Turnpike Number 1, or the Duarte Freeway, that connects the capital city of Santo Domingo with the city of Santiago. On this route, from the San Francisco de Macorís junction, turn right and continue eight kilometers to the town of Rincón.
Boundary: The MARIA concession boundaries will follow the direction of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid, on vertices with incoming and outgoing angles of 90o, according to that outlined in the following table:
Local Geology: The Maria Exploration Claim is located in the extreme northwest of the Intermediate Belt; the NW-SE alignments are products of transpressive movements, between the Maimón and Loma Caribe formations. In the Claim area, the principal outcroppings are rocks from the Maimón formation. In Maria the principal outcroppings are rocks from the Maimón formation. The Maimón formation is presented as a band of some 300 km in length and between 5 and 15 km wide that extends in a NW-SE direction. The Maimón schists form the northern flank of the Metamorphic Intermediate Belt (Bowin, 1960, 1966) and by extension, of the Central Mountain Range. From a lithological point of view, this unit consists of a group of schistose rocks, predominantly volcanic with sedimentary interspersing, that present a variable grade of deformation and metamorphism. The chemical analyses of representative lithologies range from basaltic to quartz compositions. All are highly related to Fe/Mg and with low K content. The area of the Intermediate Belt can be considered favorable land for the occurrence of two types of metallic mineralization including Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe according to their origin: a) Mineralization related to the end of the volcanism of the Island Arc. These mineralizations are located in the Maimón and Los Ranchos formations, presenting generally as disseminated sulfide complexes, with variable proportions of elements Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe; associated with these elements are silica and sulfur as final products of a magmatic differentiation by chemical affinity. Corresponding to this group would be the Pueblo Viejo deposit and b) in second place, the existing mineralization in the Maimón formation is considered, with evidence at Cerro Maimón and Loma Potrero.
These deposits correspond to the mineralization model in massive submarine basalts of the MORB type with associated sulfides. Mainly in the Maimón formation, there appear diverse stratiformic bodies of massive sulfides with appreciable longitudinal development, and are related to acidic volcaniclastic rocks in the intermediate.

Copper distribution is encountered in the Maimon formation, while the Los Ranchos formation shows lower sources of copper. Part of the distribution patterns of copper are due to overlapping of deposits responses. This explains content in large areas that exceed 100 ppm of Cu.

This formation is intruded by small to large sized diorite bodies, principally in its southern area, without encountering foliation of these intrusions.
Gold, Silver, Copper & Zinc Mineral Deposits: The area of the Intermediate Belt can be considered favorable land for the occurrence of two types of metallic mineralization including Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe according to their origin. First, Mineralization related to the end of the volcanism of the Island Arc. These mineralizations are located in the Maimón and Los Ranchos formations, presenting generally as disseminated sulfide complexes, with variable proportions of elements Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe; associated with these elements are silica and sulfur as final products of a magmatic differentiation by chemical affinity.

Geochemistry: Between 1997 and 2000 se the “Geological Mapping” project of the SYSMIN program was conducted in the Dominican Republic, and included a sub-project of geochemical and metallogenic mapping of the Bonao and Constanza quadrants on a scale of 1:100,000. The study highlighted an exceptional density and variety of mineralizations. This trait is consistent with the geotectonic framework of the country, which is particularly favorable to the formation of diverse types of deposits, some of them of great economic significance and importance. Within these important mineral deposits can be mentioned the massive volcanogenic hydrothermal sulphides (VHMS), the epithermal and the cupriferous porphyry.

Henry Geological Map
Geology: In Henry the principal outcroppings are rocks from the Maimón formation. The Maimón formation is presented as a band of some 300 km in length and between 5 and 15 km wide that extends in a NW-SE direction. The Maimón schists form the northern flank of the Metamorphic Intermediate Belt (Bowin, 1960, 1966) and by extension, of the Central Mountain Range. From a lithological point of view, this unit consists of a group of schistose rocks, predominantly volcanic with sedimentary interspersing, that present a variable grade of deformation and metamorphism. The chemical analyses of representative lithologies range from basaltic to quartz compositions. All are highly related to Fe/Mg and with low K content.The area of the Intermediate Belt can be considered favorable land for the occurrence of two types of metallic mineralization including Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe according to their origin: a) Mineralization related to the end of the volcanism of the Island Arc. These mineralizations are located in the Maimón and Los Ranchos formations, presenting generally as disseminated sulfide complexes, with variable proportions of elements Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, and Fe; associated with these elements are silica and sulfur as final products of a magmatic differentiation by chemical affinity. Corresponding to this group would be the Pueblo Viejo deposit and b) In second place, the existing mineralization in the Maimón formation is considered, with evidence at Cerro Maimón and Loma Potrero. These deposits correspond to the mineralization model in massive submarine basalts of the MORB type with associated sulfides. Mainly in the Maimón formation, there appear diverse stratiformic bodies of massive sulfides with appreciable longitudinal development, and are related to acidic volcaniclastic rocks in the intermediate. They are of a pyritic composition and have Cu as a main substance of economic interest, with variable concentrations of Au, Au and Zn; the Pb tends to be very scarce. They usually develop a hydrothermal alteration which is fundamentally of the silicification-chloritization type, though they also present phenomena of sericitization, coinciding with the general characteristics of hydrothermal alteration of these mineralizations. Copper distribution is encountered in the Maimon formation, while the Los Ranchos formation shows lower sources of copper. Part of the distribution patterns of copper are due to overlapping of deposits responses. This explains content in large areas that exceed 100 ppm of Cu.

Recently the mining sector has seen general improvements in processing under the new DGM leadership together with a departmental budget increase, staff changes and more efficient methods.
Work Completed and Condition: Since September 2012 the Santo Mining Exploration team has conducted six campaigns of surface geochemical surveys of the 220 hectare area of the Richard Exploration Concession Application. Preliminary reconnaissance was conducted by geologist Salvador Brouwer who collected rock and sediment samples at confluences and exit points. Later he supervised an active stream sediment sampling expedition conducted by geologist Professor Luz Iris Contreras who sampled the entire concession drainage basin at 100 meter spacing. Beginning in early 2013 staff geologist Elpidio Moronta assisted by seasoned gold scout Ramoncito Vasquez conducted a series of geochemistry soil sampling surveys starting on a 100 m grid and ending on a 25 m grid in areas anomalous for precious and base metals. To date over 250 samples have been collected and 236 bagged, tagged, sealed and delivered to secure storage in Santo Domingo. Selected samples were periodically delivered to Acme Laboratories in Maimon where they were dried, crushed (or sieved in the case of soils) and pulped. The processed samples were then sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver Canada (an ISO 9001 accredited facility) where they were crushed to 80% passing 2mm and split using a riffle splitter. A 250 gram sub-sample split was crushed to minus 200 mesh (74µ) and a 15 gram sub-split from the resulting pulp was then subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP-MS analysis. The unused splits were returned to Santo Domingo for storage. Several potential precious and base metal anomalies were identified from the suite Acme analyses and shallow diamond core drill targets have been defined.
Geology: Richard is hosted by the Lower Cretaceous Los Ranchos Formation, a series of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that extend across the eastern half of the Dominican Republic. It consists of a lower complex of pillowed basalt, basaltic andesite flows, dacitic flows, tuffs and intrusions, overlain by volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and interpreted to be a Lower Cretaceous intra-oceanic island arc. The unit has undergone extensive seawater metamorphism (spilitization) and lithologies have been referred to as spilite (basaltic-andesite) and keratophyre (dacite). The geology is typical of the Los Ranchos formation consisting of fragmented volcanic rocks, breccias and hydrothermalized materials. There are areas of highly silicified breccias, quartz fragments and spilite phenocryst. In the Rio Cazones you can observe outcrops of course grained, weathered, and laminated lithic tuffs with course grained keratophyre and quartz-keratophyre, small veins of quartz, copper and iron stockwork. Pyrophyllite and volcanic ashes are seen at the mouth of the Rio Cazones. In the extreme NE area of the Rio Maguaca lithic tuffs and basalt rocks (lavas) outcrops are observed indicating a contact transition phase with the pyrite and chalcopyrite present. The entire area is covered with brown, reddish and yellow sedimentary soils containing quartz, silt and clay. Outcrops are generally rarely observed except in river and streams.
Total Costs to Date & Future Cost: Costs to date are: Manpower $29,000, Logistics and Equipment $6,000, Acme Labs Analysis $3,000, Overheads $15,000. Total Costs to Date: $53,000. Budget estimate to complete geophysical investigation/interpretation, 200m trenching, 1,500 meters diamond core drilling, Laboratory analyses and preparation of a NI-43-101 / SEC equivalent report is $224,000.

Type of Ownership: One hundred percent (100%) of the Charles exploration concession application was acquired by Santo Mining Corp. from Gexplo SRL via a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement dated April 3, 2013.
Ownership Interest: Santo Mining Corp. owns one hundred percent (100%) of the Charles property rights except Gexplo SRL has a 5% net smelter return.
Claim Rights: In the Dominican Republic mineral rights are obtained by filing a 30 day claim with the DGM. During this 30 day period the stake holder has the exclusive right to apply for an exploration concession which is valid for three years and may be renewed for two consecutive 1 year periods. Finally, the holder may apply for an exploitation concession which is valid for 25 years with two 25 year renewal periods totaling 75 years. Surface rights are not included and are negotiated separately with the landowner. In the event a landowner will not provide access to the concession the applicant may request the DGM expropriation the property at fair market price. All claims including 30 day, exploration applications, exploration concessions, exploitation applications and exploitation concessions can be sold, transferred, mortgaged, leased, rented, etc..
Type of Claim or Rights: Charles is classified as an exploration concession application and is in the final stages of processing at the DGM. The claim is prospective for both placer and lode exploration. Some preliminary scoping and sampling has been performed by a Santo Mining geologist.
Claim Identification: The Charles exploration concession application was first registered by Gexplo SRL, the prior owner, at DGM on 28 June 2012 and is identified solely by its name “Charles”.
Claim Status at DGM: Completed and remaining processes in order to grant the exploration concession:
· DGM Correction Letters from Legal, Auditing and Surveying: All Completed.
· Two Public Notices of Claim Application in National Newspaper: Waiting for DGM to issue the draft of a Declaration of the concession inviting public comment. The applicant is required to provide certification that the declaration was published twice over a period of not less than days inviting public comments or objections. Cost approximately $250.

It is noted that there has been historical backlog in processing exploration concession applications and claim transfers at DGM. Recently the mining sector has seen general improvements in processing under the new DGM leadership together with a departmental budget increase, staff changes and more efficient methods.
Work Completed and Condition: Beginning in early 2013 staff geologist Elpidio Moronta assisted by seasoned gold scout Ramoncito Vasquez conducted three geochemistry rock, soil and stream sediment sampling expeditions on the 274 hectares area. On the North side of the "Loma Del Gajo Pelon" mountain the team discovered a 600 meter long by 2 meter wide vein with silver, copper and gold mineralization. To date 34 rock and stream sediment sample have been collected, bagged, tagged, sealed and delivered to secure storage in Santo Domingo. 23 Selected samples were periodically delivered to Acme Laboratories in Maimon where they were dried, crushed (or sieved in the case of soils) and pulped. The processed samples were then sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver Canada (an ISO 9001 accredited facility) where they were crushed to 80% passing 2mm and split using a riffle splitter. A 250 gram sub-sample split was crushed to minus 200 mesh (74µ) and a 15 gram sub-split from the resulting pulp was then subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP-MS analysis and fire-assay analysis with the highest result being 10.79 g/t Gold and >1% Copper. The splits of copper samples with results of 1% (maximum detection level of the test) will be retested by fire assay at Acme to determine the true grades. Additional work includes geophysical survey, trenching, diamond core drilling and preparation of a NI-43-101 and SEC equivalent report.
Geology: The Tireo Formation consists of an Upper Cretaceous package of sedimentary and volcanic rocks including andersite, dacite, mineralized quartz veins, volcanic breccias, and diorite and volcaniclastic silicification striking a NW/SE diagonal swath in west Dominican Republic.
Total Costs to Date & Future Cost: Costs to date are: Manpower $16,000 Logistics and Equipment $8,000, Acme Labs $1,150, Overhead $7,000. Total Costs to Date: $32,150. Budget estimate to complete geophysical investigation/interpretation, 300m trenching, 2,500 meters diamond core drilling, Laboratory analyses and preparation of a NI-43-101 / SEC equivalent report is $487,000.
Utilities and Infrastructure: Electrical service and water are available throughout the property. The exploration area is either hilly pastoral to remote mountainous laced with extensive drainage system of rivers and streams interspersed with ponds and small lakes all of which can be used for future core drilling and supply various processes. There is an extensive electrical power grid in Dominican and or a mining operation would generate its own electrical power.
Disclosure: At this time the Charles property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature.
GEOLOGY OF DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
The island of Hispaniola evolved as a complex island arc associated with bi-polar subduction through Cretaceous to Late Eocene time. Since then, the island has straddled the left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that separates the North American and Caribbean Plates and has largely been volcanically inactive. The Tertiary stratigraphic succession is dominated by sedimentary rocks. The most important rock units in terms of gold and base metal mineralization are the Los Ranchos, Maimon, Tireo and Duarte Formations.
Model lead isotope ages and paleontological evidence yield early Cretaceous ages for both the Los Ranchos and Maimon Formations. Together, they constituted a composite arc associated with NW-directed subduction of the proto-Caribbean plate. The Maimon Formation represents a primitive, bimodal fore-arc assemblage composed of tholeiitic basalts and subordinate felsic volcanics and meta-sedimentary rocks whereas the Los Ranchos Formation represents the axial portion of the associated island arc. The Loma Caribe peridotite, which now hosts the nickel laterite mines, and the Duarte Formation amphibolite would have been part of the oceanic crust that floored the proto-Caribbean Sea.
The volcanic arc underwent a change in polarity in Mid-Cretaceous (Aptian to Early Albanian) time, likely triggered by the collision of the Caribbean Oceanic Plateau with Hispaniola. North-vergent obduction of the Loma Caribe peridotite also took place at this time and the arc was tectonically shortened by major thrust faulting. Shearing and metamorphism was stronger in the fore-arc (Maimon) than the island arc (Los Ranchos). Renewed calc-alkaline arc volcanism began in the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian), associated with SW-directed subduction of the North Atlantic Plate beneath Hispaniola. This formed the volcanic arc now represented by the Tireo and Duarte Formations of the Central Cordillera.
Calc-alkaline volcanism continued until Middle/Late Eocene time, when the Bahama Platform (North Atlantic Plate) collided with Hispaniola and the island underwent NE-SW contraction. The Loma Caribe peridotite was emplaced over Late Cretaceous basalts of the Peralvillo Formation. Earlier faults and penetrative fabrics were steepened and overprinted by folds and Mid-Cretaceous thrusts were re-activated.
The Maimon Formation is separated from Late Cretaceous basalts (Peralvillo Formation) and the Loma Caribe peridotite by the NW-striking, left-lateral Ozama Shear Zone which is Eocene or younger. From Late Eocene time until the present, Hispaniola has been subjected to left-lateral transpression and left-lateral strike-slip faulting.
EL ANGEL DEL DESIERTO, EL RELAMPAGO AZUL, AND LA VALERIA, MEXICO
Location: Located 250 kms northwest of the town of Muzquiz near the village of San Guillermo in the State of Coahuilla, Mexico. Access is good via paved 2 lane road and final 18 kms are graded dirt roads. Small and large vehicles can drive onto the concessions. Travel time to Muzquiz is 3½ hours.
Type Ownership: On March 12, 2013 entered into a Mineral Exploitation and Production License Agreement (Agreement) in Mexico with the concessionaire Compania Minera Angeles del Desierto SA de CV. The 15 year renewable agreement allows Santo Mining to exclusively mine the El Angel del Desierto, El Relampago Azul and La Valeria mineral concessions in Ocampo, State of Coahuilla, Mexico. Santo Mining will pay the concessionaire 40% net return resulting from the extraction, processing, and refining of minerals from the three concessions and Santo Mining will retain 60%.
Payments to Concessionaire: On 20 March 2013 Santo Mining has paid an initial payment of $10,000. On or before 14 September 2013 Santo Mining will pay an additional $100,000 and issue 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock. On or before 14 March 2014 will pay $100,000 as advanced payment of the 40% royalty. The Agreement can be recorded with the General Office of Mines. The above dates have been revised in accordance with a contract Extension sign by the Parties on July 15, 2013 where the Parties mutually agreed to extend all the terms of the contract by 60 days.
Claim Rights and Identification: Mexican mining concessions are valid for 50 years. The 147.8712 hectare “El Angel del Desierto” #232980 concession was granted on 25 November 2008 and expires on 24 November 2058. The 219.00 hectare “El Relampago Azul” #232961 concession was granted on 25 November 2008 and expires on 24 November 2058. The 360.00 hectare “La Valeria” #228996 concession was granted on 27 February 2007 and expires on 26 February 2057. The total concession area is 726.8712 hectares. On 6 September 2011 the owner of the surface rights granted the concessionaire the right to use the property for exploration and exploitation of minerals for a royalty of $1.20 per ton of material extracted for a period of 10years renewable for a second term of 10 years.
Type of Claim or Rights: The exploitation concessions are in force and an environmental permit has been issued on five hectares which can be expanded to +/- 60 hectares or more. The property has all the other entitlements to allow mining except a forestry permit that takes 60 days to obtain at a cost of $20,000 and a water well permit available over the counter from the local municipality. The claims are prospective for both placer and lode exploitation. The concessionaire has conducted geochemical testing and Santo Mining has completed a surface geochemical survey of approximately 60 hectares and is currently conducting metallurgy and mineralogy testing with SGS labs in Tucson and Montana Tech.
Claim Maintenance: The concessionaire is responsible for keeping the three concessions current with the General Mining Office however if they fail to do so Santo Mining is authorized to do so.
Work Completed and Condition: Since November 2012 the Santo Mining Exploration team has conducted three surface geochemical survey of part of the 727 hectare area of the three Exploitation Concessions. Preliminary reconnaissance and geochemical survey was conducted by Mine Engineer Juan Luis Castillo who collected 18 rock soil samples from the base perimeter and summit of a mineralized hill. The samples were bagged, tagged, sealed and delivered to secure Acme Laboratories in Guadalajara Mexico where they were dried, crushed (or sieved in the case of soils) and pulped. 500 g of the processed samples were then sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver Canada (an ISO 9001 accredited facility) where they were crushed to 80% passing 2mm and split using a riffle splitter. A 250 gram sub-sample split was crushed to minus 200 mesh (74µ) and a 15 gram sub-split from the resulting pulp was then subjected to aqua regia digestion and multi-element ICP-MS analysis. No precious and base metal anomalies were identified in the Acme analyses reportedly due to the refractory nature of the mineralization. Acme was instructed to send the 18 sample splits to Garza Laboratorio Industrial, Saltillo, Mexico for pre-treatment by heating to 4000 C under gas Chlorination according to Garza to transform the gold in Tellurium and Selenium into Chloroauric Acid and heated further to liberate the gold. These pre-treated samples were dispatched to Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada for gravimetric and fire assay analysis. All the samples returned positive results with average results of 3.17 g/t Gold and 57.3 g/t silver. The highest results were 8.581 g/t gold and 148.1 g/t silver. In March 2013 three 50 kg samples were by Juan Luis Castillo from prior sample locations #3, #7 and #15. A 35kg split of each sample was tagged and sealed in new 5 gallon plastic buckets and dispatched to SGS laboratories in Durango, Mexico. From there they were forwarded to SGS in Tucson, Arizona for Metallurgy scoping initially on the #3 sample taken from the summit of the mineralized hill, the suite of tests included metallic assays, precious metal characterization, gravity concentration, cyanidation bottle roll tests, etc. SGS sub-contracted Montana Tech to conduct mineralogy on all three samples.
Metallurgy & Mineralogy Testing: The results of the SGS Labs metallurgy and Montana Tech mineralogy were inconclusive due to the refractory nature of the ore material. Refractory or Rebellious ores are not always amenable to standard metallurgy and mineralogy testing and can be extremely complex. Unraveling all the nuances of the gold, sulphide and silica associations can be a challenge for process mineralogist especially when the gold is not visible under the microscope and dissolved in solids.
Pretreatment Process: Having witnessed the liberation of gold and silver from samples using both mercury amalgamation and the Garza Labs roasting and gas chlorination process we recognize that there are indeed precious metals in the mineral samples. Therefore the company’s immediate priority is to establish a set procedure to readily analyze the “refractory’ geochemical rock and soil. Our solution is to duplicate the Garza Laboratory’s roasting and gas chlorination pretreatment process “in-house” consisting of roasting and gas-chlorination of the samples on company premises to liberate the precious metals prior to submitting for fire assay at ISO-9000 certified labs such as Acme of Vancouver or Inspectorate in Reno. This will enable us to proceed with our geochemical exploration without delay.
In-House Pretreatment Process Confirmation: Following this SMC has set up an in-house pretreatment laboratory in Santo Domingo that can duplicate the Garza roasting/gas chlorination process. On the 1st and 2nd of August 2013 splits of sample #3B and #7B were successfully pre-treated and silver and gold like mineralization in the form of abundant shiny metallic specs were clearly visible to the naked eye and the samples are being immediately dispatched for fire assay. Additionally SMC is in the final few days of completing a chlorine gas pretreatment pilot plant in Muzquiz Mexico to pretreat bulk samples. SMC is also currently conducting empirical testing of 50 kg samples in a mercury amalgamation pilot plant in Muzquiz Mexico. Our objective is to have a quick and effective means to be able to assay the refractory ore samples so we can proceed with the surface and sub-surface exploration at El Angel del Desierto. Samples are submitted to ISO 9000 certified labs for fire assay. We anticipate this process of pretreating samples and assaying to take 45-60 days and synchronized with the date we have committed to pay the concessionaire the second Payment of $100,000. The results may then also be used by qualified US or Canadian consulting geologists to prepare a bankable feasibility study and if required the pretreatment process can be demonstrated.
Small Scale Concentration Plant limitations and Risks: If the above laboratory and pilot plant scale pretreatment processing clearly identifies a prospective gravity concentration and floatation process that SMC can utilize, we may proceed with acquiring or leasing a small modular concentrating plant to start gaining some experience with the material and sell the concentrate to one of several companies that have expressed interest. At this modular scale we consider the risk to be minimal. Our reasoning is part of the concession consists of a well-defined 25-30m high mineralized hill that has tested positive for precious metals around the entire perimeter of the its base and its summit leading us to consider that the precious metal grades are consistent throughout the material in the hill. During the next few months we hope to have sufficient capital resources to drill the target hill and immediate surrounding area to a minimum depth of 50m and if the grades are confirmed the drill results would be incorporated into the preliminary bankable feasibility study.
Mexican El Angel del Desierto and Area Geology: The Concessions are located on the south periphery of the extinct volcano Cerro Minerva and consist of a numerous tertiary intrusive igneous rocks whose composition varies from granite, granodiorite, gabbro, diorite, andesite porphyries, rhyolite, and syenite as stocks, sills and dikes, and are generally rolling hills and all are accessible by truck transport. A jagged metamorphic aureole formed in the areas of contact with limestone and shale intrusive bodies generally consisting of irregular garnet skarn, marble, hornfels and recrystallized limestone. The gold-silver mineralization is largely encapsulated in silica.
Total Costs to Date & Future Cost: Costs to date are: Manpower $14,300, Logistics and Equipment $9,200, Labs Analysis 1,800.00, Metallurgy testing $8,300, Overhead $12,200. Total Costs to Date: $45,800. Budget estimate to complete geophysical investigation and interpretation, 2,000 meters shallow drilling, Laboratory analyses and preparation of a NI-43-101 / SEC equivalent report is $235,000.
Utilities and Infrastructure: No electrical or water services are available at the property. Two 10” water wells have been drilled on site.
Disclosure: At this time the Walter property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature.
