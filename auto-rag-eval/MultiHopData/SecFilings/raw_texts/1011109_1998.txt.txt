ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.
General
At March 24, 1999 the Company owns nine multifamily apartment communities containing a total of 1,778 apartment homes. The nine existing Communities of River Oaks, Rosewood Plantation, Plantation Trace, Preston Oaks, Highland Park, Bentley Place, Crestmark, Ivey Brook and Bradford Creek, containing a total of 1,778 apartment units, are stabilized; the 118-unit first phase of the Abbotts Bridge is under construction; and the 287-unit second phase of Abbotts Bridge, the 332-unit Ballantyne Community, and the 249-unit Old Norcross Community are now under development. (The Company considers a Community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier of (a) attainment of 95% occupancy as of the first day of any month, or (b) one year after completion of construction.)
As of December 31, 1998, the Company owned nine stabilized Communities containing a total of 1,778 apartment homes that had a physical occupancy rate of 95.5%. The Company sold the 232-unit Windsong Community on January 9, 1998 and its two retail centers on July 17, 1998.
The Company believes that the demand for multifamily housing in Atlanta will increase due to Atlanta's growing population. According to the Atlanta Regional Commission (the "ARC"), both population and job growth in Atlanta are projected to be above the national average for the foreseeable future. (The ARC is the regional planning and governmental coordination agency for the 10-county Atlanta Region, which is comprised of Fulton, Dekalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton, Rockdale, Henry, Douglas, Cherokee, and Fayette counties.)
The following information is based on statistical estimates published by the ARC. The population of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow 40.9% for the period from 1990 to 2010, from 2,557,800 persons in 1990 to 3,603,800 persons in 2010. The estimated population of the Atlanta Region increased by 21.6% from 2,557,800 persons in 1990 to 3,110,600 persons in 1998, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and the largest in the Southeast.
Employment of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow 52.5% for the period from 1990 to 2010, from 1,426,000 jobs in 1990 to 2,175,000 jobs in 2010. Estimated employment of the Atlanta Region increased by 24.4% from 1,426,000 jobs in 1990 to 1,774,000 jobs in 1997. According to the Georgia Department of Labor, as of January 1, 1999, the unemployment rate of the Atlanta Region was 2.8%, which was below the Georgia unemployment rate of 3.6% and the U.S. unemployment rate of 4.0%.
Housing units in the Atlanta Region increased an estimated 21.7%, from 1,052,430 units in 1990 to 1,281,003 units in 1998. Multifamily homes in the Atlanta Region increased 13.8% from 342,441 units in 1990 to 389,611 units in 1998.
Certain basic information regarding the Communities is summarized in the following table.
THE COMMUNITIES
- -----------------------
(1) The 50-unit second phase of Plantation Trace completed its lease-up phase in November 1998, and its 12-month historical occupancy percentage is not comparable. The physical occupancy rate for the entire Plantation Trace Community as of December 31, 1998 was 87.1%. (2) The 24-unit second phase of Preston Oaks completed its lease-up phase in July 1998, and its 12-month historical occupancy percentage is not comparable. The physical occupancy rate for the entire Preston Oaks Community as of December 31, 1998 was 99.2%. (3) Bradford Creek completed its lease-up phase in August 1998, and its 12-month historical occupancy percentage is not comparable. Its physical occupancy rate as of December 31, 1998 was 98.5%. (4) Because these Communities are still in the development stage, the dates of completion and exact number of units are estimates and are subject to change, and the square footage information is not available.
Certain annual operating data regarding the Company's stabilized Communities at December 31, 1998 are summarized in the following table (with the second phases of Crestmark, Preston Oaks and Plantation Trace described separately for this purpose and Windsong omitted due to its sale in January 1998). Except for those figures noted with an asterisk, the occupancy rates shown represent the average physical occupancy of the applicable Community calculated by dividing the total number of vacant days by the total possible number of vacant days for each year and then subtracting the resulting number from 100%. The figures noted with asterisks reflect the applicable data on December 31 of the specified year and are not annualized, because the applicable Community was under construction and in its initial lease-up period during at least a portion of that year. During lease-up, units are leased as they are constructed and made ready for occupancy building by building, thus annualization of data is not possible during that period. Throughout this table, "N/A" means "not applicable," i.e., no unit in the Community was available to be occupied during the relevant year. Footnotes are on the following page.
Footnotes are on the following page
(1) The Company acquired Bentley Place in March 1996. (2) The Company acquired Crestmark in June 1996. Phase II of Crestmark completed its lease-up in September 1997. Beginning with 1998, both phases of Crestmark are combined. (3) Phase II of Preston Oaks completed its lease-up in August 1998 and its occupancy as of December 31, 1998 was 100%. (4) Bradford Creek completed its lease-up in August 1998 and its occupancy as of December 31, 1998 was 94%. (5) Phase II of Plantation Trace completed its lease-up phase in November 1998 and its occupancy as of December 31, 1998 was 92%.
As described below, the Communities are located in four counties, or six submarkets of the Atlanta region and in Charlotte. The Ballantyne Community now under development is in Charlotte, North Carolina and is described after the Georgia properties. Each heading identifies the Community or Communities within the specified county and submarket. Population and employment data provided for each submarket was in each case obtained from the ARC. Multiple Communities are located in each of the Duluth, Peachtree Corners and Perimeter Center/North Springs submarkets; thus those Communities compete not only with unaffiliated apartment communities but also with each other. Please see "Summary of Debt Secured by the Communities," which follows the description of the individual Communities, for an explanation of the terms of the Company's secured indebtedness.

Douglas County benefits from its accessibility to downtown Atlanta to the east via I-20 and to Hartsfield International Airport to the southeast via Thornton Road/Camp Creek Parkway. Just across the county line to the east lies the Fulton Industrial District, the Southeast's largest contiguous industrial park. The Fulton Industrial District consists of more than 50,000,000 square feet of both manufacturing and warehouse space and stretches six miles north and south along Fulton Industrial Boulevard. It represents 20% of Atlanta's total inventory of warehouse/industrial space, and an additional 1,000,000 square feet is under construction. Numerous Fortune 500 companies are represented in the Fulton Industrial District, employing more than 100,000 people.
Thornton Road/I-20 Area - Crestmark Community
Thornton Road/I-20 Area. Thornton Road is the third exit west of I-285 on I-20 and connects I-20 with Hartsfield International Airport to the southeast and the significant residential base of Douglas, West Cobb and Paulding counties to the north and east. Several office and business parks that total more than 2,000,000 square feet of space and house corporations such as BellSouth, Mitsubishi, Robert Bosch Corporation, TDK Electronics, and Saab-Scania contribute to a large employment base of approximately 20,000 people within the Thornton Road area. Restaurant, hospitality and retail conveniences support the existing employment and residential base in the Thornton Road corridor. The area also benefits from its close proximity to the Fulton Industrial District as well as the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park, both of which are less than three miles away. At the northwest corner of the Thornton Road/I-20 interchange is the Columbia/HCA Parkway Medical Center, a 320-bed acute care medical facility that employs approximately 600 people.
Crestmark. Crestmark is a 334-unit garden apartment community that was completed in two phases: a 248-unit first phase in 1993 and an 86-unit second phase in 1997. Crestmark consists of 16 three and four story stacked stone and wood sided buildings, 17 garages and 24 storage units located on a 32.2 acre site on Thornton Road, approximately one-half mile north of its intersection with I-20 in Douglas County.

Charlotte, NC - Ballantyne
The following information is based on statistics and estimates published by the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. During the last ten years, Charlotte's population grew by 24%, which was well above the national growth rate of 9%. Since 1986, employment in Charlotte has grown 29%, compared to the U.S. growth of 14%. Nine of the nation's top 200 banks operate in Charlotte, including NationsBank (which is the nation's largest bank) and First Union Corporation. Other major employers include Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System, Duke Energy Corporation and USAirways. Additionally, nearly 300 of the nation's largest industrial and service corporations listed by FORTUNE magazine have facilities in the area. Education is a top priority in the area as evidenced by The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System recently receiving a national Community Award for Excellence in Education.
The Ballantyne Community will be located on a 23.8 acre site at the intersection of Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) and John J. Delaney Drive. The Ballantyne area is the largest mixed-use development in Mecklenburg County. This Community will have approximately 332 garden-style apartments. The Company has not determined the unit mix or developed an estimate of the construction cost. The Community is located near I-485 and I-77, which offers convenient access to downtown Charlotte and I-85.
The table on the following page summarizes the amenities of each of the existing Communities and the first phase of the Abbotts Bridge Community now under construction. The specific amenities of the development Communities have not yet been fully determined.
SUMMARY OF AMENITIES OF THE COMMUNITIES

Competition
All of the Communities are located in developed areas, and numerous other apartment projects are located within the market area of each Community. The number of competitive apartment communities in the area could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to lease its apartments at the rental rates anticipated, and no assurances can be given regarding the development of additional competing multifamily communities in the future. The remainder of this section summarizes the competition for each of the Communities. The following information reflects the study by the Company of apartment communities in each submarket that are believed by the Company to be closely competitive with the Community or Communities within such submarket. This section includes certain summary information obtained from various sources - - including developers and real estate brokers, as well as on-site visits - regarding those apartment communities. Although the Company has attempted to verify such information and believes that it is substantially accurate on the whole, information regarding a particular community may be incorrect due to the sources relied upon or erroneous information supplied by competitors.
Plantation Trace, River Oaks, and Bradford Creek. The Duluth market area, which the Company considers to be a two mile radius from these Communities, currently consists of 17 multifamily communities, including River Oaks, Plantation Trace, and Bradford Creek. Although the Bridgewater apartment community which was previously developed and sold by an affiliate of Mr. Roberts - is located more than two miles from Plantation Trace, it is also included in the Duluth market area because it offers units with attached garages and its architecture and amenities are similar to Plantation Trace and its Phase II. Of the 17 existing communities in the area, five were completed in the last year, including Bradford Creek and the second phase of Plantation Trace. Due to the quality of construction, age of the communities, type of amenities, resident profiles and rental rates, the Company believes that only nine of the other 14 communities are in direct competition with Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek.
Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook. The Peachtree Corners multifamily market area, which is a three mile radius from these two Communities, currently consists of 23 multifamily communities, including Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook. Of the 23 existing communities in the market area, only four have been built since 1988. The remaining communities range from approximately 12 to 27 years old. The Company believes that Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook draw residents from all of the other 21 communities located in the market area but that only six of the 21 communities compete closely with Rosewood Plantation and Ivey Brook.
Preston Oaks. The Company believes that the north central Perimeter multifamily market area is a two-mile radius around this Community. It is generally bounded by Roswell Road to the west, Ashford Dunwoody Road to the east, Spalding Drive to the north and Glenridge Drive to the south, and it currently consists of 24 multifamily communities, including Preston Oaks. Of the 23 other existing communities in the market area, only four were built prior to 1983. The remaining 19 communities range from approximately three to seven years of age. The Company believes that Preston Oaks competes with all 23 of these communities.
Highland Park. The North Springs multifamily market area is an approximately two-mile radius around this Community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the north and west, Georgia 400 to the east and Dalrymple Road to the south, and currently consists of 35 communities, including Highland Park. Of the 35 existing communities in the market area, only five have been built since 1989. The remaining communities range in age from 11 years to over 20 years. The Company believes that Highland Park will draw residents from all of the 34 communities located in the market area, but that only 11 of the 34 communities will compete closely with Highland Park.
Bentley Place. The Pleasantdale multifamily market area, which is a two mile radius around Bentley Place, currently consists of 28 multifamily communities, including Bentley Place. Of the 28 existing communities in the market area, only five have been built since 1989. The remaining properties range from approximately 11 to 21 years old. The Company believes that Bentley Place draws residents from all of the other 27 properties located in the market area. However, based upon a comparison of factors such as quality of features, architecture, number and type of amenities, construction quality and age of community, the Company believes that only nine of the 26 communities compete closely with Bentley Place. Each of these nine properties was constructed between 1986 and 1998.
Crestmark. The Thornton Road multifamily market area is an approximately two-mile radius around the Crestmark Community. It is generally bounded by I-20 to the south, Blairs Bridge Road to the east, and Georgia Highway 78 to the north and west, and it currently consists of eight communities, including Crestmark. Of the eight existing communities in the market area, four have been built since 1990. The Company believes that Crestmark will draw residents from all of the seven other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only five of the seven other communities will compete closely with Crestmark.
Abbotts Bridge. The Alpharetta multifamily market is an approximately two-mile radius around the Abbotts Bridge Community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the east, Old Alabama to the south, GA-400 to the west, and Winward Parkway to the north, and it currently consists of 15 Communities, including Abbotts Bridge. The Company believes that Abbotts Bridge will draw residents from all of the 14 other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only 13 of the 14 other communities will compete closely with Abbotts Bridge.
Ballantyne. The Ballantyne multifamily market is an approximately two-mile radius around the Community. It is generally bounded by the Princeton Road to the east, Providence Road West to the south, Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) to the west, and I-485 to the north, and it currently consists of nine communities, including Ballantyne. The Company believes that Ballantyne will draw residents from all of the eight other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only seven of the eight other communities will compete closely with Ballantyne.
Old Norcross. The Old Norcross multifamily market is an approximately two-mile radius around the Old Norcross Community. It is generally bounded by Herrington Road to the east, Club Drive to the south, Steve Reynolds Boulevard to the west, and Sugarloaf to the north and east, and it currently consists of 23 communities, including Old Norcross. The Company believes that Old Norcross will draw residents from all of the 22 other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only 15 of the 22 other communities will compete closely with old Norcross.
Summary of Debt Secured by the Communities
Certain information regarding the Company's indebtedness secured by the Communities is as follows:
- ------------------
(1) Each of the loans secured by the Plantation Trace and Rosewood Plantation Communities may be prepaid upon payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% multiplied by a fraction having as its numerator the number of months to maturity and its denominator the number of months in the full term of the loan, or (b) the present value of the loan less the amount of principal and accrued interest being repaid. Each loan may be prepaid in full during the last 30 days prior to its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
(2) Each of the loans secured by the River Oaks, Preston Oaks, Highland Park, Ivey Brook, Bentley Place and Bradford Creek Communities may be prepaid in full upon payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the outstanding principal balance of the loan, or (b) the sum of the present value of the scheduled monthly payments to the maturity date and the present value of the balloon payment due on the maturity date, less the outstanding principal balance of the loan on the date of prepayment. Each such loan may be prepaid in full during the last 90 days prior to its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
(3) The loan secured by the Crestmark Community may be prepaid upon the payment of a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the outstanding principal balance, or (b) the product obtained by multiplying the amount of principal being prepaid by the excess (if any) of the monthly note rate over the assumed reinvestment rate by the present value factor. If the loan is prepaid after expiration of the yield maintenance period, but more than ninety days before the maturity date, the prepayment premium shall be 1% of the unpaid principal balance of the note. The loan may be prepaid in full during the last 90 days prior to its maturity date without any prepayment premium.
Possible Additional Communities to Be Developed
From time to time Roberts Properties plans the development of other apartment communities to be located on property owned by Roberts Properties or other affiliates of Mr. Roberts, or on property that one of such entities is interested in acquiring. Mr. Roberts may elect to raise the required equity for any such community by syndicating a limited partnership. Alternatively, the Company may seek to raise the equity required to purchase and develop the community by selling Shares. If Mr. Roberts elects to raise equity through a limited partnership, Mr. Roberts may seek to cause such partnership to be merged into the Operating Partnership at a later date. Such a transaction would require the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners of such partnership and of a majority of the disinterested members of the Company's Board of Directors, and no assurances can be given regarding whether Mr. Roberts will ultimately determine to seek a merger in that manner, or whether such a merger would in fact be approved by the requisite majority in interest of limited partners in such partnership and by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board.
As described above in "Part I, Item 1, Description of Business - Growth Strategies - Development Strategy," three other multifamily apartment communities that are anticipated to total 986 apartment homes are in the development or construction stage.
Other Real Estate Assets
The Operating Partnership sold its two retail centers totaling 15,698 square feet on July 17, 1998 for $2,400,000 in cash resulting in a gain, net of minority interest, of $300,000. Net sales proceeds were $2,182,000, after deducting for closing costs and prorations of $218,000. The Company reinvested the net proceeds in new apartment communities. The purchaser was unaffiliated with the Company, and the transaction was negotiated at arms-length. The net book value of the property was $1,715,000 at June 30, 1998. The Company paid Roberts Properties $92,500 for consulting fees in connection with the sale. The retail centers together composed less than 1% of the Company's assets and generated less than 2% of its gross revenues for 1998.
