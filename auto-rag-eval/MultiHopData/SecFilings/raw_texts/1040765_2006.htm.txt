Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs.

The expansion and renovation are expected to be completed during 2007.
The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, owned 50% by us, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, J.C.

As of December 31, 2006, we have taken 510,000 square feet out of service for redevelopment. We have leased 416,000 square feet to Century 21, Whole Foods and Target (ground leased). The expansion and renovations, as planned, are expected to be completed during 2008.

2006 rental revenue by type of retailer:
Shopping center lease terms range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenants’ sales and pass through to tenants the tenants’ share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures.

TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED LOGISTICS SEGMENT
As of December 31, 2006, we own a 47.6% interest in AmeriCold Realty Trust (“AmeriCold”). AmeriCold, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, provides the food industry with refrigerated warehousing and transportation management services. Refrigerated warehouses are comprised of production, distribution and public facilities. In addition, AmeriCold manages facilities owned by its customers for which it earns fixed and incentive fees. Production facilities typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors that are located nearby. Customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in these facilities until they are shipped to the next stage of production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide variety of customers’ finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each distribution facility generally services the surrounding regional market. Public facilities generally serve the needs of local and regional customers under short-term agreements. Food manufacturers and processors use these facilities to store capacity overflow from their production facilities or warehouses. AmeriCold’s transportation management services include freight routing, dispatching, freight rate negotiation, backhaul coordination, freight bill auditing, network flow management, order consolidation and distribution channel assessment. AmeriCold’s temperature controlled logistics expertise and access to both frozen food warehouses and distribution channels enable its customers to respond quickly and efficiently to time-sensitive orders from distributors and retailers.
AmeriCold’s customers consist primarily of national, regional and local frozen food manufacturers, distributors, retailers and food service organizations, such as H.J. Heinz, Con-Agra Foods, Altria Group (Kraft Foods), Schwan Corporation, Tyson Foods, General Mills and Sara Lee. Other than H.J. Heinz, which accounted for 17.9% of this segment’s total revenue, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of this segment’s total revenue.
