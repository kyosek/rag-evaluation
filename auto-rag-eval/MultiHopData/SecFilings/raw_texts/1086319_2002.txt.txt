ITEM 2 - DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
Petroleum and Natural Gas Properties
Gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation and development company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects primarily in the Rocky Mountain Region. Gasco's strategy is to enhance stockholder value by using new technologies to generate high-potential exploitation prospects in this area. The Company's principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights, either directly or indirectly, and the exploitation and development of properties subject to these leases.
Riverbend Project
The Riverbend project is comprised of approximately 105,598 gross acres in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah, of which the Company holds an interest in approximately 31,199 net acres as December 31, 2002. Additionally, Gasco has an
opportunity to earn or acquire an interest in approximately 40,135 gross acres in this area under farm-out and other agreements. Gasco's geologic and engineering focus is concentrated on three tight-sand formations in the basin: the Wasatch, Mesaverde and Blackhawk formations. Significant acquisitions and agreements related to this area are discussed below.
In December 2000, Gasco entered into an agreement with ConocoPhillips Company ("ConocoPhillips") that defined a 60,000-acre Area of Mutual Interest ("AMI") within the Riverbend project, not all of which is currently leased by either Gasco or ConocoPhillips. This agreement was subsequently amended to reduce the area that it covers to 30,000 acres. Under the terms of this agreement, ConocoPhillips paid $1,000,000 to Gasco upon execution of the agreement, and later expended $8,000,000 in connection with the drilling and completion of three producing wells. As a result of ConocoPhillips' drilling, Gasco earned additional acreage under certain farm-out agreements during 2001. Under the agreement, ConocoPhillips also has the right to acquire an 80% interest in all of Gasco's leases and farm-out agreements within the AMI by assigning to Gasco leasehold interests in two leases within the AMI in which Gasco had no ownership interest. As of December 31, 2002, these assignments of interest were completed and are reflected in the total acreage positions in this area described above.
During January 2002, Gasco entered into an agreement with Halliburton Energy Services ("Halliburton") under which Halliburton has the option to earn a participation interest proportionate to its investment by funding the completions of Wasatch/Mesaverde wells. The Company and Halliburton will also share technical information through the formation of a joint technical team.
Gasco began drilling the first well under this agreement during February 2002. Approximately $1,000,000 was spent on this well, which began selling gas in the beginning of July 2002. In April 2002, the Company drilled its second operated well in this immediate area for a total cost of approximately $1,300,000. Sales of production from this well began during the middle of August 2002. Compressor capacity limitations on a third party gathering system in this area caused one of these wells to be shut-in and have significantly restricted the production rate of the other well through the end of 2002. During January 2003, Gasco entered into a contract with the system operator to put a new compressor in place. The compressor began operating during the beginning of February 2003 and is expected to meet the Company's projected compression needs for the next twelve months. During January 2003, the Company incurred approximately $94,000 for installation and operation costs of the compressor for the next twelve months.
Gasco began drilling its third operated well in this area during September 2002. The well reached total depth in October 2002, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2002 and began selling gas during February 2003. The Company's share of the drilling costs for this well was approximately $1,200,000. Gasco's fourth operated well in this area reached total depth during December 2002 and is currently awaiting completion. The total drilling costs for this well are expected to be approximately $1,200,000. Gasco's fifth operated well in this area was spudded in October 2002 with a small rig that has been moved off the
drill site. A larger rig was moved onto the site in March 2003 to complete the drilling of this well at a total estimated cost of approximately $1,200,000. As of March 27, 2003, Halliburton has exercised its option to participate in the first two wells and is evaluating the remaining three wells.
In addition to the Gasco-operated wells described above, the Company also owns a 14 to 20% working interest in five wells that were drilled by ConocoPhillips in this area during late 2001 and through the fourth quarter of 2002. Gasco did not particpate in a sixth well drilled by ConocoPhillips. Four of these wells are currently selling gas, and one has been drilled and is awaiting completion.
Greater Green River Basin Project
In Wyoming, Gasco established an AMI with Burlington Resources ("Burlington") covering approximately 330,000 acres in Sublette County, Wyoming within the Greater Green River Basin. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has a leasehold interest in approximately 118,325 gross acres and 75,096 net acres in this area. The exploration agreement governing the AMI requires Burlington to drill two wells and to shoot 180 miles of high-resolution 2-D seismic. As of December 31, 2002, Burlington has completed shooting the 180 miles of 2-D seismic and has drilled and completed both of the wells, both of which are currently selling gas. The Company participated in the drilling of a well in Sublette County Wyoming, which was spudded during September 2002. Gasco has a 31.5% interest in this well, which is operated by Burlington. The well is currently selling gas, and the Company's total cost for this well was approximately $700,000. Gasco also participated in another Burlington-operated well in this area during October 2002. The Company has a 31.5% interest in this well, which was recently completed. The Company's share of the drilling and completion costs is expected to be approximately $900,000.
During 2001, three shallow wells were drilled in this area for the purpose of holding acreage and earning expiring leasehold. All of these wells have been cased and are in various stages of completion, however none of these are currently producing.
During February 2002, the Company purchased at a Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") sale a 45% interest in 21,614 acres (9,726 net acres) for approximately $1,428,000. After this sale, the Company was notified by the BLM in Wyoming that several environmental groups filed a protest against the BLM offering numerous parcels of land for oil and gas leasing. All of the parcels (leases) purchased by the Company were placed in suspense pending the resolution of this protest. If the protest is deemed to have merit, the lease purchases will be rejected and the money paid for the leases will be returned to the Company. If the protest is deemed to be without merit, the leases will be released from suspense and issued to the Company. Effective July 16, 2002, the Company assigned 25% of this suspended interest to Brek Energy Corporation ("Brek"), as further discussed below, resulting in the Company's net acres in this transaction being reduced from 9,726 to 7,295 net acres. As of December 31, 2002, the BLM has released from suspension and issued leases covering 5,700 gross acres representing 1,924 net acres to the Company. These issued leases are reflected in the Company's total acreage position stated above. Currently, 15,914 gross acres (5,371 net acres) remain in suspense and are excluded from the acreage totals above. The value of the remaining suspended leases is recorded as unproved mineral interests in the accompanying financial statements.
On February 19, 2002, the Company purchased leasehold interests in Sublette County, Wyoming covering approximately 18,451 gross acres (16,421 net acres) for a total purchase price of $1,500,000. Effective July 16, 2002 the Company assigned 25% of its interest to Brek resulting in the Company's interest in this property being reduced from 16,421 to 12,316 net acres.
During February 2002, Gasco drilled a well in the Southwest Jonah field located in the Greater Green River Basin in Sublette County, Wyoming. The well was drilled to a total depth of 11,000 feet. The well encountered natural gas, however not of sufficient quantities to be deemed economic. The well was plugged and abandoned during March 2002. The net dry hole cost of the well was $541,125 and was recorded as impairment expense during 2002 because the Company believed that the total costs for this well exceeded the present value, discounted at 10%, of the future net revenues from its proved oil and gas reserves.
On May 1, 2002, the Company issued 9,500,000 shares of its common stock to the Shama Zoe Limited Partnership ("Shama Zoe"), a private oil and gas company, for the acquisition of 53,095 gross (47,786 net) acres plus other assets and consideration in the Greater Green River Basin in Sublette County Wyoming. The acquisition was valued at $18,525,000 using a stock price of $1.95 per common share, which represented the closing price of the Company's common stock on April 23, 2002; the date the agreement was executed. The original Property Purchase Agreement governing this transaction prevented the Company from issuing additional shares of its common stock at prices below $1.80 per share and from granting registration rights in connection with the issuance of shares of its common stock. In connection with the August 14, 2002 issuance of 6,500,000 shares of common stock, as described under Item 5, below, the original Property Purchase Agreement was amended to allow for the issuance of these shares at a price of $1.00 per share and Shama Zoe was granted an option to sell to the Company 1,400,000 shares of the Gasco common stock that it acquired in the transaction at $1.00 per share at any time prior to December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002 Shama Zoe exercised the option and sold 1,400,000 shares of Gasco common stock back to the Company for $1.00 per share. The Company issued a $1,400,000 promissory note to Shama Zoe for the purchase of these shares. The promissory note beared interest at 12% and had a maturity date of March 14, 2003. On February 20, 2003, the Company repaid this note plus accrued interest in full.
In connection with this transaction, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the payment to an employee of the Company, who was instrumental in securing the Company's agreement with Shama Zoe, of $300,000 in cash and the issuance of options to purchase 250,000 shares of Gasco common stock at an exercise price of $1.95 per share, which was equal to the fair market of the common stock on April 23, 2002. Prior to the end of 2002 the Company had paid $150,000 of the total cash bonus to the employee; therefore, the remaining cash payment of $150,000 was accrued in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 2002.
During May 2002, the Company elected to participate in a 3D seismic shoot covering 100 square miles in Sublette County, Wyoming. The Company's share of the costs for the seismic data, which is currently being processed, was $850,000.
Southern California Project
The Company has a leasehold interest in approximately 4,068 gross acres (3,032 net acres) on two oil prospects in Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties of Southern California. The Company has no drilling or development plans for this acreage during 2003, but plans to continue paying leasehold rentals and other minimum geological expenses to preserve the Company's acreage positions on these prospects. The Company may consider selling these positions in the future.
Repurchase of Stock for Acreage
On July 16, 2002, Gasco executed and closed a purchase agreement with Brek, and certain other Gasco stockholders (the "Other Stockholders"), pursuant to which Brek and the Other Stockholders purchased from Gasco an undivided 25% of Gasco's working interests in all undeveloped acreage owned by Gasco, representing 35,169 net undeveloped acres, in exchange for 6,250,000 shares of Gasco common stock and 500 shares of Gasco preferred stock held by Brek and the Other Stockholders. The Other Stockholders assigned their right to receive their share of such working interests to Brek, so that Brek acquired title to all of the working interests conveyed by Gasco in the transaction. Brek also has the option to acquire an additional 5% undivided interest in Gasco's undeveloped acreage by paying a total of $10.5 million in two equal installments on or before January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005, respectively. A 2.5% interest will be conveyed to Brek upon receipt of each installment. Brek must make timely payment of the first installment in order to maintain the option to acquire the additional 2.5% interest with the second installment.
The transaction was recorded at $16,709,000 based on the average trading price of the Company's common stock when the transaction was consummated The transaction was recorded as a reduction to the Company's unproved properties and a reduction to the Company's additional paid in capital, preferred and common stock.

Productive Gas Wells
The following summarizes the Company's productive and shut-in gas wells as of December 31, 2002. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Shut-in wells are wells that are capable of production but are currently not producing. Gross wells are the total number of wells in which the Company has an interest. Net wells are the sum of the Company's fractional interests owned in the gross wells.

As of March 26, 2003, the Company was in the process of drilling one developmental well in the Riverbend area of Utah; however, the Company's net interest in this well has not been determined.
The Company operates six of the producing wells and all of the shut-in wells. Five of the remaining seven producing properties in the above table were drilled by ConocoPhillips within Gasco's and ConocoPhillip's Area of Mutual Interest in the Riverbend Project and are operated by ConocoPhillips. The two remaining producing wells are located in Sublette County Wyoming and were drilled and are operated by Burlington.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth the undeveloped and developed leasehold acreage, by area, held by the Company as of December 31, 2002. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Developed acres are acres, which are spaced or assignable to productive wells. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which Gasco has a working interest. Net acres are the sum of Gasco's fractional interests owned in the gross acres. The table does not include acreage that the Company has a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which the Company has not yet received leasehold assignments. These acquisitions or agreements, which are significant to the Company's acreage position, are summarized below the following tables. In certain leases, the Company's ownership is not the same for all depths; therefore, the net acres in these leases are calculated using the greatest ownership interest at any depth. Generally this greater interest represents Gasco's ownership in the primary objective formation.

During February 2002, the Company purchased at a BLM sale a 45% interest in 21,614 gross acres (9,726 net acres) for approximately $1,428,000. After the sale, the Company was notified by the BLM in Wyoming that several environmental groups filed a protest against the BLM offering numerous parcels of land for oil and gas leasing. All of the parcels (leases) purchased by the Company were placed in suspense pending the resolution of this protest. If the protest is deemed to have merit, the lease purchases will be rejected and the money paid for the leases will be returned to the Company. If the protest is deemed to be without merit, the leases will be released from suspense and issued to the Company. Effective July 16, 2002, the Company assigned 25% of this suspended interest to Brek resulting in the Company's net acres being reduced from 9,726 to 7,295 net acres. As of December 31, 2002, the BLM has released from suspension and issued leases covering 5,700 gross acres representing 1,924 net acres to the Company. These issued leases are reflected in the Company's total acreage position stated above. Currently, 15,914 gross acres (5,371 net acres) remain in suspense and this acreage is not included in the above table. The value of the remaining suspended leases is recorded as unproved mineral interests in the accompanying financial statements.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company has purchased or earned 26,496 gross (7,003 net) acres in the Uinta Basin in Utah and in Sublette County, Wyoming but has not yet received leasehold assignments. The Company also has the contractual right to earn or acquire 40,135 gross (21,849 net) acres within the Uinta Basin and 3,042 gross (770 net) acres in Sublette County through future drilling projects that must be completed at various dates through the end of May 2006. All of this acreage is excluded from the table above.
As of December 31, 2002, approximately 79% of the acreage that Gasco holds is located on federal lands and approximately 19% of the acreage is located on state lands. It has been Gasco's experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands. The Company has generally been able to obtain state permits within 30 days, while obtaining federal permits has taken several months or longer. Accordingly, if the development of the Company's acreage located on federal lands is delayed significantly by the permitting process, the Company may have to operate at a loss for an extended period of time.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth the Company's drilling activity during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Company had no drilling activity during the year ended December 31, 2000.

Office Space
The Company leases approximately 3,255 square feet of office space in Englewood, Colorado for approximately $46,000 per year under two leases, both of which terminate on August 30, 2004. The Company's management believes that this space will be adequate for its operations during the next year.
