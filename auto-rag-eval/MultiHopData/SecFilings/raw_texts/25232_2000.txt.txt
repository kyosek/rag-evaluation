Major Properties - ----------------
General - -------
This section describes the major operating properties in which the Company has an interest either directly or indirectly through joint venture arrangements. A "negative investment" in a joint venture results from distributions of capital to the Company, if any, exceeding the sum of (i) the Company's contributions of capital and (ii) reported earnings (losses) of the joint venture allocated to the Company. "Investment" in a joint venture means the book value of the Company's investment in the joint venture.
Wildwood Office Park - --------------------
Wildwood Office Park is a 285 acre Class A commercial development in Atlanta, Georgia, master planned by I.M. Pei, which includes 8 office buildings containing 2,441,000 rentable square feet. The property is zoned for office, institutional, commercial and residential use. Approximately 105 acres in the park are owned by, or committed to be contributed to, Wildwood Associates (see below), including approximately 34 acres of land held for future development. The Company owns 100% of the 130 acre balance of the land available for future development.
Located in Atlanta's northwest commercial district, just north of the Interstate 285/Interstate 75 intersection, Wildwood features convenient access to all of Atlanta's major office, commercial and residential districts. The Wildwood complex overlooks the Chattahoochee River and borders 1,200 acres of national forest, thus providing an urban office facility in a forest setting.
Wildwood Associates. Wildwood Associates is a joint venture formed in 1985 between the Company and IBM. The Company and IBM each have a 50% interest in Wildwood Associates. At December 31, 2000, the Company's investment in Wildwood Associates and a related partnership, which included the cost of the land the Company is committed to contribute to Wildwood Associates, was a negative investment of approximately $39,081,000.
Wildwood Associates owns the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building (687,000 rentable square feet), the 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (635,000 rentable square feet), the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (314,000 rentable square feet), the 4100 and 4300 Wildwood Parkway Buildings (250,000 rentable square feet in total) and the 4200 Wildwood Parkway Building (260,000 rentable square feet). As of March 15, 2001, these buildings were all 100% leased. Wildwood Associates also owns 14 acres leased to two banking facilities and five restaurants.
Other Buildings in Wildwood Office Park. Wildwood Office Park also contains the 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building, a 107,000 rentable square foot office building located on approximately 10 acres which is wholly owned by the Company. The 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building was 100% leased as of March 15, 2001.
In addition, the 3100 Windy Hill Road Building, a 188,000 rentable square foot corporate training facility occupies a 13-acre parcel of land which is wholly owned by the Company. The training facility improvements were sold in 1983 to a limited partnership of private investors, at which time the Company received a leasehold mortgage note. The training facility land was simultaneously leased to the partnership for thirty years, along with certain equipment for varying periods. The training facility had been leased by the partnership to IBM through November 30, 1998.
Effective January 1, 1997, the IBM lease was extended eight years beyond its previous expiration, to November 30, 2006. Based on the economics of the lease, the Company will receive substantially all of the economic risks and rewards from the property through the term of the IBM lease. In addition, the Company will receive substantially all of the future economic risks and rewards from the property beyond the IBM lease because of the short term remaining on the land lease (7 years) and the large mortgage note balance ($25.9 million) that would have to be paid off, with interest, in that 7 year period before the limited partnership would receive any significant benefit. Therefore, effective January 1, 1997, the $17,005,000 balance of the mortgage note and land was reclassified to Operating Properties, and revenues and expenses (including depreciation) from that point forward have been recorded as if the building were owned by the Company.

This 8% purchase money note had an outstanding balance of $16,393,000 at December 31, 2000. If the purchase money note is paid in accordance with its terms, it will amortize to approximately $15.3 million ($59 per rentable square foot) over the ten-year term of the Coca-Cola lease, at which time Coca-Cola is entitled to receive the preferred return described below, and the property may be sold, released, or returned to the lender under the purchase money note for $1.00 without penalty or any further liability to the Company for the indebtedness.

(2%), owns a 20% interest in the partnership that owns One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. C-H Associates' 20% ownership of One Ninety One Peachtree Tower results in an effective 9.8% ownership interest by CREC, subject to a preference in favor of the majority partner, in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. The balance of the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was owned by DIHC Peachtree Associates, which was an affiliate of Dutch Institutional Holding Company, but was acquired by Cornerstone Properties, Inc. in October 1997.

The One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was funded substantially by debt until March 1993, at which time the predecessor owner contributed equity in the amount of $145,000,000 which repaid approximately one-half of the debt. Subsequent to the equity contribution, C-H Associates had been entitled to a priority distribution of $250,000 per year (of which CREC was entitled to receive $112,500) for seven years beginning in 1993 and ending in 2000.

After the owner, currently Equity Office Properties Trust, recovers its preferred return, the partners share in any operating cash flow distributions in accordance with their percentage interests. The project is subject to long-term debt of approximately $142,350,000 at December 31, 2000.

The options may be exercised in whole or in part over the option period and the option price on the fee simple land is $985 per acre on January 1, 2001, escalating at 6% on January 1 of each succeeding year during the term of the option. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximately 734, 640 and 328 acres, respectively, of the option related to the fee simple interest was exercised. In 2000, approximately 461 acres were simultaneously sold for gross profits of $1,546,000 and approximately 264 acres were acquired for the development of the Bentwater residential community. Approximately 1,735 lots will be developed within Bentwater on an approximate total of 1,290 acres, the remainder of which will be acquired as needed through exercises of the option related to the fee simple interest. The remaining 9 acres were being held for sale or future development.

Warrants to Purchase Stock in Other Companies - ---------------------------------------------
Cypress Communications, Inc. In December 1999, the Company executed an Amended and Restated Master Communications License Transaction Agreement (the "Master Agreement") with Cypress Communications, Inc. ("Cypress") that provides for Cypress and the owner of each building subject to the Master Agreement to enter into a Communications License Agreement (an "Agreement") pursuant to which Cypress will have the non-exclusive right to access the risers and certain areas of certain of the Company's and its joint ventures' office and medical office buildings. Each Agreement allows Cypress to install equipment and wiring, at Cypress' sole cost and expense, and to offer a variety of telecommunication services to tenants of each of the applicable buildings. Each Agreement has a term of 5 years with an automatic renewal for another 5 years unless Cypress elects not to renew or Cypress fails to equip the applicable building with a server within 18 months of the execution of the Agreement.
Pursuant to each Agreement, the Company receives a percentage of the revenue earned by Cypress from tenants and third parties who use the telecommunication services. In addition, the Company entered into a Stock Warrant Agreement with Cypress under which Cypress issued 248,441 warrants to the Company, each warrant entitling the owner to purchase one share of Cypress' common stock at an exercise price of $4.22 per share. On February 10, 2000, Cypress completed its initial public offering of 10 million shares of common stock. The warrants have not been exercised, and the underlying common stock has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and is not required to be registered until 18 months after completion of the initial public offering.
Effective February 10, 2000 (the date Cypress completed its initial public offering), the value of the warrants were recorded in both Other Assets and Deferred Income in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the warrants of $566,000 was determined based on the difference between management's estimate of the fair market value of the warrants less the exercise price times the number of warrants granted. The Company early adopted SFAS No. 133 effective October 1, 2000 (see Note 1). Warrants are considered derivatives under this statement and, therefore, the warrants were marked-to-market which resulted in a reduction of net income of approximately $566,000 which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
AtheroGenics, Inc. In July 1998, the Company received 50,000 warrants at an exercise price of $5.00 per share for the purchase of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of AtheroGenics, Inc, the tenant which leases 100% of AtheroGenics and who completed an initial public offering on August 8, 2000. As the share price at December 31, 2000 equaled the warrant price, no adjustment was necessary pursuant to SFAS No. 133.
