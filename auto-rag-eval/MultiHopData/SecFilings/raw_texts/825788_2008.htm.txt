All leases are triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating costs including maintenance, repairs, utilities, property taxes, and insurance.

rent provisions, which require the tenant to pay a specified percentage (6% to 8%) of gross sales above a threshold amount.

Vacant Park Forest, IL Property
In the Second Quarter of 2006, Management defaulted former tenant, a Popeye’s Famous Fried Chicken restaurant (“Popeye’s”), for failure to meet its lease obligations, and filed suit for possession of the Park Forest property in the Cook County Judicial Court. The Partnership continued the pursuit of all legal remedies available to recover possession and terminate the Lease. However, a Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) was executed on May 1, 2007, and it was agreed to by all parties that Popeye’s would pay its past due rent and property taxes escrow obligations. In accordance with the Settlement, the Partnership received a payment for the approximately $10,000 of past due property tax escrow on May 3, 2007 and the three equal installment payments of $4,233 related to the past due rent obligations on May 8, June 20, 2007, and July 17, 2007. The Settlement reaffirmed that Popeye’s remained responsible for monthly rent obligations and property tax through the remainder of its Lease, which was set to expire on December 31, 2009.
Popeye’s ceased its operations in June of 2008. The lease was terminated and the tenant vacated the property in July of 2008.

The Partnership received full payment of both of these items from Popeye’s in August of 2008 in accordance with the terms of the lease termination and settlement agreement.
The Partnership has been unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for the vacant Park Forest, IL property. The Partnership agreed to sell the property for $50,000 to a prospective purchaser. Negotiations ended due to uncertainty over 2008 real estate tax obligations due in 2009. The Partnership had no other interested parties for this vacant property in a distressed location. Accordingly, the carrying value of the
vacant Park Forest, IL property was reduced by $276,186 to its estimated fair market value of $50,000 at September 30, 2008. The reduction included $129,450 related to land and $137,736 related to buildings and improvements.
As of December 31, 2008, the Partnership has accrued twelve months of estimated 2008 property tax related to the Park Forest, IL property, which the Partnership will be obligated to pay to the Cook County taxing authority in 2009. Due to the lease termination and settlement, such property taxes will not be collectible from the former tenant. The former tenant’s property tax escrow balance held with the Partnership as of September 30, 2008 met all but $1,300 of the Park Forest property’s second 2007 property tax installment paid in November of 2008. The minimal shortage was accrued and expensed by the Partnership as of September 30, 2008.
A small strip of the Park Forest, IL land was sold to the Illinois Department of Transportation to be used as street right of way in December of 2007. Net sale proceeds amounted to approximately $34,000. A net gain on the sale of $25,000 was recognized in the Fourth Quarter of 2007.
