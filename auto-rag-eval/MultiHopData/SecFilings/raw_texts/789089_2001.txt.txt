The Managing General Partner attributes the occupancy fluctuations at the properties to the following: a decrease at North Park Apartments due to increased competition in a soft market; a decrease at Scotchollow, Pathfinder Village and The Bluffs due to softening markets in their respective localities caused primarily by a weakness in the local industries and recent layoffs; a decrease at Buena Vista Apartments due to increased competition in the local market; an increase at Shadowood Apartments due to an aggressive marketing and resident retention program.
As noted under "Item 1. Description of Business", the real estate industry is highly competitive. All of the properties are subject to competition from other residential apartment complexes in the area. The Managing General Partner believes that all of the properties are adequately insured. Each property is an apartment complex which leases units for lease terms of one year or less. No residential tenant leases 10% or more of the available rental space.
Real Estate Taxes and Rates
Real estate taxes and rates in 2001 for each property were as follows:
