As of December 31, 2002, the Owned Properties consisted of 152 multifamily residential properties containing 41,776 apartment units. At the time of the IPO (August 4, 1994), Home Properties owned 11 communities containing 3,065 units and simultaneously with the closing of the IPO acquired an additional four communities containing 926 units. From the time just prior to the IPO to December 31, 2002, the Company experienced a compounded annualized growth rate of 36% in the number of apartment units it owned. In 2002, Home Properties acquired 4,492 apartment units in 21 communities for a total purchase price of approximately $430 million. Also in 2002, the Company sold 12 communities with a total of 1,724 units for total consideration of $87.1 million.
The Owned Properties are generally located in established markets in suburban neighborhoods and are well maintained and well leased. Average economic occupancy at the Owned Properties was 92% for 2002. The Owned Properties are typically two and three story garden style apartment buildings in landscaped settings and a majority are of brick or other masonry construction. The Company believes that its strategic focus on appealing to middle income and senior residents and the quality of the services it provides to such residents results in lower turnover. Average turnover at the Owned Properties was approximately 46% for 2002, which is significantly below the national average of 60% for garden-style apartments.
Resident leases are generally for a one year term. Security deposits equal to one month’s rent are generally required.
Certain of the Owned Properties secure mortgage loans. See Schedule III contained herein (F-39 to).
The table on the following pages illustrates certain of the important characteristics of the Owned Properties as of December 31, 2002.

Property Development
Management believes that new construction of market rate multifamily apartments is not economically feasible in most of its markets. Therefore, Home Properties’ prior development and redevelopment activities were limited to government-assisted multifamily housing. In 1996, the Operating Partnership acquired substantially all of the assets of C.O.F., Inc. (formerly Conifer Realty, Inc.) and Conifer Development, Inc. (collectively, “Conifer”), a developer and manager of government-assisted multifamily housing.
Effective December 31, 2000, the Company sold its affordable housing development operations to Conifer, LLC. Conifer, LLC is led by Richard J. Crossed, a former Executive Vice President and former director of the Company. The Company retained property management operations for 8,325 apartment units in 136 existing affordable communities.
In December 2002, the Company, including its equity affiliates (the Management Companies), determined that it would market for sale virtually all of the assets associated with its interests in various affordable property limited partnerships. Such assets include the equity interest in the affordable housing partnerships, loans, advances and management contracts. As a result, the Company, including its equity affiliates, recorded impairment charges aggregating $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Such charges principally relate to reducing recorded amounts relating to the previously mentioned assets to estimated fair value.
The Company has retained the ability to develop new market rate communities, but does not plan to focus on this activity. Rather, it plans to engage in development activity only on a very selective basis.
Property Management
As of December 31, 2002, the Managed Properties consist of: (i) 8,072 apartment units where Home Properties is the general partner of the entity that owns the property; and (ii) 1,993 apartment units managed for others. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies also engaged in the following property management activities: (i) commercial properties managed for an affiliate which contain approximately 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area; (ii) a master planned community managed for an affiliate known as Gananda; (iii) a 140-lot Planned Unit Development managed for an affiliate known as College Greene; (iv) a 400-lot Planned Unit Development managed for a third party known as Riverton; and (v) a 178 single family Planned Unit Development and 163 government assisted apartment units to be developed for an affiliate and known as Old Brookside. Management fees are based on a percentage of rental revenues or costs and, in certain cases, revenues from sales.
The Company may pursue the management of additional properties not owned by the Company, but will only do so when such additional properties can be effectively and efficiently managed in conjunction with other properties owned or managed by Home Properties.
