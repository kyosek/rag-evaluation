Geographic Distribution
Substantially all of SCI's distribution properties are located in 44 target market cities. The table below demonstrates the geographic distribution of SCI's equity real estate investments as of December 31, 1997 and 1996. This chart does not include land held for future development, which was less than 6% of assets, based on cost at December 31, 1997 and 1996.
- -------- (1) Includes properties under development at their budgeted total development costs, rather than costs incurred to date. (2) Does not include refrigerated warehousing facilities. (3) Includes 62 buildings under development. (4) Includes 47 buildings under development.
Consistent with SCI's strategy to build a critical mass in the three key target markets of Chicago, Los Angeles and the New Jersey/I-95 corridor, the combined percentage of real estate investments for these markets to SCI's total real estate investments, increased from 10.11% at December 31, 1996 to 13.80% at December 31, 1997.
There are numerous other distribution properties located in close proximity to each of SCI's properties. The amount of rentable space available in any target market city could have a material effect on SCI's ability to rent space and on the rents charged. In addition, in many of SCI's submarkets, institutional investors and owners and developers of distribution facilities compete for the acquisition, development and leasing of distribution space. Many of these persons have substantial resources and experience.
THE PARTNERSHIPS
SCI's intention is to own substantially all properties directly; however, to facilitate certain strategic acquisitions, SCI has completed four transactions which involved the formation of four partnerships. At December 31, 1997, SCI owned directly or indirectly 68.7%, 97.6%, 80.6% and 96.7% of SCI Limited Partnership-I, SCI Limited Partnership-II, SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV, respectively (collectively, the "Partnerships"). The properties owned through SCI Limited Partnership-I cannot be sold, prior to the occurrence of certain events, without the consent of the limited partners thereto, other than in tax-deferred exchanges, which restriction could adversely affect SCI's ability to strategically reconfigure the portion of its investment assets represented by this Partnership. There are no restrictions on the sale of properties held by SCI Limited Partnership-II, SCI Limited Partnership-III or SCI Limited Partnership-IV. SCI views all assets acquired as long-term investments but will only agree to partnership resale restrictions where the assets acquired are of such strategic quality that SCI anticipates that there will be no change in investment strategy with respect to such assets through the duration of the restriction. SCI may acquire additional properties through partnerships in the future.
The Partnerships have been organized as Delaware limited partnerships. Generally, pursuant to the Partnership agreements, SCI, as the sole general partner in each of the Partnerships other than SCI Limited Partnership-IV, in which a wholly owned subsidiary of SCI is the sole general partner, has full responsibility for
the management and control of the Partnerships, and the limited partners have no authority to transact business for, or, except as described below, participate in the management decisions of, the Partnerships. However, any decision to amend certain provisions of the applicable Partnership agreement, to dissolve a Partnership prior to the term set forth in the applicable Partnership agreement or to enter into certain extraordinary transactions where the limited partners would not receive the same consideration as shareholders of SCI, would require the consent of all limited partners. Pursuant to the Partnership agreements, SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, may not voluntarily withdraw from the applicable Partnership or transfer or assign its interests in the Partnership without the consent of all of the limited partners thereto. The limited partners may freely transfer their Partnership units to affiliates, provided that such transfer does not cause a termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and does not cause SCI to cease to comply with requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for qualification as a REIT. Each of the Partnership agreements grants to limited partners the right to exchange their Partnership units for Common Shares, subject to the conditions described below.
Distinction from Other REIT Partnerships
The Partnerships differ from partnerships formed by certain other REITs (which are commonly referred to as UPREITs) in that:
. A substantial majority of the limited partners were previously unaffiliated with SCI, thus the Partnership transactions were negotiated on an arms' length basis;
. None of the limited partners have a controlling influence over SCI, which is the sole general and managing partner of each of the Partnerships other than SCI Limited Partnership-IV, in which a wholly owned subsidiary of SCI is the sole general partner;
. SCI or its wholly-owned subsidiary, as the case may be, has sole discretion as to the disposition of assets held in the Partnerships, subject to one Partnership's requirement that for the foreseeable future all dispositions be through tax-deferred exchanges, as to which SCI has sole discretion; and
. SCI is not restricted from acquiring properties outside the Partnerships and intends to own a majority of its assets directly, so that no conflict of interests exists with respect to future acquisitions.
12.6% of SCI's real estate (based on cost) is owned by the following partnerships:
SCI Limited Partnership-I
In connection with the formation of SCI Limited Partnership-I, certain previously unaffiliated parties agreed to contribute certain properties to this Partnership in exchange for the issuance by such Partnership of approximately 4,520,533 Partnership units. In exchange for the Partnership units, the limited partners contributed the following properties: (i) 1,704,333 square feet of industrial property in SCI's San Francisco (South Bay Area), California target market; and (ii) 2,186,572 square feet in SCI's San Francisco (East Bay Area), California target market. The foregoing properties had an aggregate purchase price to SCI of $190 million.
The Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-I grants limited partners the right to consent to (i) the sale or other disposition of any property of the Partnership (other than through a tax-deferred exchange or a pledge to secure a financing) or (ii) the incurrence of any indebtedness (other than loans which SCI may make to the Partnership for capital requirements). The requirement for the consent of the limited partners in connection with a sale or other disposition of a property expires upon the earlier to occur of the 30th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement or the date on which 75% of the Partnership units outstanding have been exchanged for Common Shares. Limited partners are entitled to exchange each Partnership unit for up to one Common Share. A maximum of 4,520,531 Common Shares were so issuable effective as of January 1, 1995. On May 31, 1996, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 4,520,531 Common Shares issuable
upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-I units. The registration statement was declared effective on June 29, 1996. Additionally, the limited partners are entitled to receive fully cumulative quarterly distributions per Partnership unit equal to the quarterly distributions payable in respect of Common Shares. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, limited partners are entitled to a pro rata distribution of the net proceeds of such sale, with a corresponding downward adjustment in the number of Common Shares for which a unit may be exchanged. Each limited partner has agreed that, from and after the time that such limited partner has exercised its right to exchange a Partnership unit for a Common Share and for a period of four years after the date of the Partnership agreement, the limited partner will not, during any calendar year, sell Common Shares owned by the limited partner if such sale would exceed 33% of the aggregate number of Partnership units and Common Shares outstanding on the date of the Partnership agreement. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner.
SCI Limited Partnership-II
In exchange for approximately 645,867 Partnership units, the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II contributed the following properties: (i) 437,542 square feet of industrial property in SCI's Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas target market; (ii) 217,504 square feet in SCI's Austin, Texas target market; (iii) 132,605 square feet in SCI's San Francisco (East Bay Area), California target market; (iv) 51,750 square feet in SCI's Denver, Colorado target market; (v) 493,894 square feet in SCI's Charlotte, North Carolina target market; and (vi) 270,000 square feet in SCI's El Paso, Texas target market. The foregoing properties had an aggregate purchase price to SCI of $45.5 million. None of the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II is affiliated with SCI.
The Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II granted to limited partners the right to exchange each Partnership unit for a Common Share beginning on February 15, 1995. On May 19, 1995, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 955,864 Common Shares relating to Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-II Partnership units and up to 310,000 Common Shares issued in one of SCI's prior private placement offerings; such registration statement was declared effective on June 26, 1995. Through December 31, 1997, limited partners had exchanged 555,654 of their Partnership units in SCI Limited Partnership-II for 555,651 Common Shares (and cash payments for partial units). As a result of these conversions and additional capital contributions by SCI, SCI's general partnership interest increased from 81.2% to 97.6% and 90,213 limited partnership units remain outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-II. Limited partners are also entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, SCI as general partner is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale.
SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV
On October 28, 1994, SCI acquired $91.7 million of additional properties and related assets through two Partnerships, SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV. SCI Limited Partnership-IV contained approximately $81 million of properties and related assets at December 31, 1997, and is structured as a distinct entity to maintain the credit rating of the secured notes assumed by such Partnership. A total of 583,512 limited partnership units were issued by these two Partnerships to certain previously unaffiliated parties. SCI contributed $35.4 million of cash to these Partnerships in 1994 to retire debt, pay part of the aggregate property purchase price, make capital improvements and pay closing costs. $47.1 million of mortgage debt was assumed by these
Partnerships. During 1995, SCI contributed an additional $11.9 million to SCI Limited Partnership-III for property acquisitions which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 50.4% to 71.8%. In 1996, SCI contributed $4.2 million to SCI Limited Partnership III in connection with property acquisition. In the aggregate, these contributions increased SCI's general partnership interest from 71.8% to 75.6%. On October 23, 1997, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 583,508 Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV units. The registration statement was declared effective on November 6, 1997. In the fourth quarter of 1997, 105,000 partnership units were converted to 105,000 SCI Common Shares, bringing SCI's general partnership interest to 80.6% at December 31, 1997. During 1996 and 1997, SCI contributed $2.5 million to SCI Limited Partnership IV in connection with tax deferred exchanges of real estate which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 96.36% to 96.65% at December 31, 1997. There were 409,900 and 68,612 partnership units outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV, respectively, at December 31, 1997.
The Partnership agreements for these Partnerships are substantially similar to the Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II and permit holders of limited partnership units to exchange each unit for a Common Share beginning on October 29, 1995. SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, has complete discretion and control with respect to all management matters, including disposition of assets, except for certain restrictions on the retirement of assumed debt.
Limited partners are entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a limited partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner. In the event that the Partnerships sell any of their respective properties, SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale, except (during the first 10 years of the Partnerships only) to the extent of unpaid distributions and interest thereon.
SCI DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
SCI Development Services Incorporated ("SCI Development Services") was incorporated in Delaware in August 1994 for the purpose of acquiring, developing, operating, and selling distribution space facilities either for its own account or for third parties. SCI owns 100% of the nonvoting preferred stock of SCI Development Services and an unaffiliated third party owns 100% of the voting common stock and, as a result, SCI has no control over the operations of SCI Development Services. SCI, through its preferred stock ownership, is entitled to 66 2/3% of the first $300,000 of net operating cash flow and is entitled to 95% of the remaining net operating cash flow of SCI Development Services. The activities of SCI Development Services are consolidated with SCI. As of December 31, 1997, SCI Development Services' real estate portfolio had a book value of $188.7 million. SCI Development Services is a taxable corporation and pays federal and state income taxes at the applicable corporate rates.

SCI Logistics owns a majority interest (77.1%) in CSI and SCI owns 100% of the nonvoting preferred stock of SCI Logistics. An unaffiliated third
party owns 100% of the voting common stock of SCI Logistics and, as a result, SCI has no control over the operations of SCI Logistics.
