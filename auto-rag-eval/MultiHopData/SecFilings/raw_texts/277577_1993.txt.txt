Trust's management, the Trust's offices are adequate for its present operations.
Details of the Trust's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 1993, are set forth in Schedules XI and XII, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA". The discussions set forth below under the headings "Real Estate" and "Mortgage Loans" provide certain summary information concerning the Trust's real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
The Trust's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment (which includes direct equity investments and partnerships) and properties held for sale, primarily obtained through foreclosure of mortgage notes receivable. The discussion set forth below under the heading "Real Estate" provides certain summary information concerning the Trust's real estate and further summary information with respect to the portion of the Trust's real estate which consists of properties held for investment, the portion which consists of investments in partnerships and the portion which consists of properties held for sale.
At December 31, 1993, only the Century Centre II Office Building, with a carrying value of $24.5 million, accounted for 10% or more of the Trust's total assets. At December 31, 1993, 85% of the Trust's assets consisted of investments in real estate, 6% consisted of investments in partnerships and 6% consisted of mortgage notes and interest receivable. The remaining 3% of the Trust's assets at December 31, 1993, were cash, cash equivalents and other assets. It should be noted, however, that the percentage of the Trust's assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of the Trust's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
At December 31, 1993, the Trust held mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in several geographic regions of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Southeast, as shown more specifically in the table under "Mortgage Loans" below. The Trust's real estate is also geographically diverse. At December 31, 1993, the Trust held investments in apartments and commercial real estate in each of the geographic regions of the continental United States, although its apartments are concentrated in the Southeast, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below.
To continue to qualify for federal taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Trust will, among other things, be required to hold at least 75% of the value of its total assets in real estate assets, government securities, cash and cash equivalents at the close of each quarter of each taxable year.

Geographic Regions
The Trust has divided the continental United States into the following six geographic regions.
Northeast region comprised of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, and the District of Columbia.
Southeast region comprised of the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
Southwest region comprised of the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
Midwest region comprised of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
Mountain region comprised of the states of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.
Pacific region comprised of the states of California, Oregon and Washington.
Real Estate
At December 31, 1993, 85% of the Trust's assets were invested in real estate located throughout the continental United States. The Trust's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships, properties held for sale, primarily obtained through foreclosure of mortgage notes receivable, and an investment in the equity securities of CMET, a REIT advised by BCM.
Types of Real Estate Investments. The Trust's real estate consists of apartments and commercial properties, primarily office buildings and shopping centers, or similar properties having established income-producing capabilities. In selecting real estate, the location, age and type of property, gross rentals, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
physical condition are considered. The Trust may acquire properties subject to, or assume, existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for a portion of its real estate. The Trust's Board of Trustees may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new equity investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of shareholders to the extent such policies are not governed by the Declaration of Trust.
Although the Trust has typically invested in developed real estate, the Trust may invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with affiliated or unaffiliated partners. To the extent that the Trust invests in construction and development projects, the Trust would be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and delays, associated with such high risk activities.
At December 31, 1993, the Trust was making significant capital improvements to five of its properties, the Dunhill/Devonshire, Huntington Green and Lakepointe Apartments and the Emerson Center and Rancho Sorrento Office Buildings.
In the opinion of the Trust's management, the real estate owned by the Trust is adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of the Trust's real estate (other than the unimproved land and a single-family residence described below) at December 31, 1993.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units and amount of commercial square footage owned by the Trust and does not reflect the value of the Trust's investment in each region. The Trust also owns one parcel of unimproved land of 46.27 acres located in the Southeast region and one single-family residence located in the Southwest region. See Schedule XI to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for a more detailed description of the Trust's real estate portfolio.

In June 1993, the Trust obtained first mortgage financing secured by the Bayfront Apartments in the amount of $2.1 million. The Trust received net cash of $1.8 million. The remainder of the financing proceeds were used to fund escrows for replacements and repairs and to pay closing costs associated with the financing. The Trust paid a 1% mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $21,000 to BCM based upon the new first mortgage financing of $2.1 million.
In October 1991, after determining that further investment in the Century Centre II Office Building could not be justified without a substantial modification of the mortgage debt, the property was placed in bankruptcy. A plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court in March 1993 and the bankruptcy court confirmed the Plan in November 1993. The confirmed Plan of Reorganization reduces the interest rate on the $21 million first mortgage to 1-1/2% above LIBOR, which currently results in an interest rate of 5 1/2% per annum. The reduced interest rate was retroactively applied as of October 15, 1991. The Plan also extends the note's maturity two years to November 1995, with three consecutive one-year extension options.
Under the Plan, the Trust deposited $1.0 million in cash with the lender to pay accrued and unpaid interest, 1993 property taxes and all closing costs associated with the transaction. In 1994, the Trust will be required to maintain a $200,000 balance in the escrow account with the lender. The Trust has also pledged one of its properties held for sale, Stewart Square Shopping Center, as additional collateral on the first mortgage. Also pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Trust acquired the $7.5 million second mortgage plus all accrued and unpaid interest of $1.7 million, for $300,000 in cash. The Trust recognized an extraordinary gain of $8.9 million in connection with the debt modification and discounted debt purchase.

In 1990, the Trust ceased making payments on the first mortgage secured by a portion of the Dunhill/Devonshire Apartments. At the time, the Trust was the holder and 50% owner of this first mortgage. The other 50% of the mortgage was owned by a financial institution in receivership, which refused to fund its share of advances necessary to preserve the value of the property. Accordingly, the Trust, as mortgage holder, foreclosed on this property and was, for its own accord, the high bidder at the foreclosure sale. To date, the Trust has not received an executed release of lien. In lieu of recording a gain of $1.3 million on this transaction, the Trust has written down the carrying value of such property by that amount.
The $1.6 million first mortgage secured by the Palm Court Apartments, located in Miami, Florida, matured in July 1993. Prior to the maturity, the Trust obtained the lender's written agreement to extend the note. Thereafter, the lender refused to execute the extension documents and has subsequently rejected the Trust's tender of mortgage payments in accordance with the extension agreement. The matter is presently in litigation. If adversely determined, the Trust is prepared to payoff the mortgage debt.
In January 1994, the Trust obtained first mortgage financing secured by the Bay West Apartments in the amount of $5.1 million. The Trust received net cash of $1.0 million after the payoff of $3.9 million in existing debt. The remainder of the financing proceeds were used to fund escrows for replacements and repairs and to pay closing costs associated with the financing. The Trust paid a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $51,000 to BCM based upon the new first mortgage financing of $5.1 million.
In March 1994, the Trust obtained first mortgage financing secured by the Carlyle Towers Apartments in the amount of $4.5 million. The Trust received net cash of $2.3 million after the payoff of $2.2 million in existing debt. The remainder of the financing proceeds were used to fund escrows for replacements and repairs and to pay closing costs associated with the financing.
Also in March 1994, the Trust obtained first mortgage financing secured by the Woodcreek Apartments, located in Denver, Colorado, in the amount of $3.0 million. The Trust received net cash of $1.2 million after the payoff of $1.7 million in existing debt. The remainder of the financing proceeds were used to fund escrows for replacements and repairs and to pay closing costs associated with the financing.
Partnership Properties. Set forth below are the Trust's investments in partnership properties and the average annual rental rate and occupancy thereof at December 31, 1993 and 1992:
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Real Estate (Continued)
The Trust, in partnership with CMET, owns Sacramento Nine ("SAC 9"), which currently owns two office buildings in the vicinity of Sacramento, California. The Trust has a 70% interest in the partnership. The SAC 9 partnership agreement requires the consent of both the Trust and CMET for any material changes in the operations of the partnership's properties, including sales, refinancings and changes in the property manager. Therefore, the Trust is a noncontrolling partner and accounts for its investment in the partnership under the equity method.
The Trustees of the Trust, except for Messrs. Friedman, Doyle and Weisbrod, also serve as trustees of CMET. BCM, the Trust's advisor until March 31, 1994, also serves as advisor to CMET. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
In April 1993, SAC 9 sold one of its office buildings for $1.2 million. SAC 9 received $123,000 in cash, of which the Trust's equity share was $86,000, after the payoff of an existing first mortgage with a principal balance of $685,000. SAC 9 also provided $356,000 of purchase money financing. The note receivable bears interest at 9% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest and matures in June 1998. SAC 9 recognized a gain of $59,000 on the sale, of which the Trust's equity share was $41,000.
In June 1993, SAC 9 sold two other of its office buildings. One was sold for $1.3 million in cash, of which the Trust's equity share was $910,000. SAC 9 recognized a gain of $437,000 on the sale, of which the Trust's equity share was $306,000. SAC 9 paid a 3% sales commission of $39,000 to Carmel Realty, Inc., an affiliate of BCM, ("Carmel Realty") based upon the $1.3 million sales price of the property.
The other office building was sold for $2.0 million. SAC 9 received $1.1 million in cash, of which the Trust's equity share was $750,000. SAC 9 also provided $887,000 of purchase money financing. SAC 9 recognized a gain of $720,000 on the sale, of which the Trust's equity share was $504,000. One note receivable with a principal balance of $410,000 bears interest at a variable interest rate, currently 6% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matures in June 1994. A second note receivable, with a principal balance of $477,000 bears interest at 10% per annum, and all principal and accrued interest are due at maturity in May 1994. SAC 9 paid a 3% sales commission of $59,000 to Carmel Realty based upon the $2.0 million sales price of the property.
The Trust and CMET are also the partners in Income Special Associates ("ISA"), a joint venture partnership in which the Trust has a 40% partnership interest. ISA owns a 100% interest in Adams Properties Associates ("APA"). APA owns 33 industrial warehouses. The Trust accounts for its investment in the APA partnership under the equity method. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
In November 1992, the Trust acquired all of the general and limited partnership interests in Consolidated Capital Properties II ("CCP II"),
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Real Estate (Continued)
whose assets included a 23% limited partnership interest in English Village Partners, L.P. ("English Village"). On July 1, 1993, CCP II made an additional capital contribution to English Village of $464,000 to increase its limited partnership ownership interest to 49% and to acquire a 1% general partnership interest in the partnership. The Trust continues to account for its investment in English Village under the equity method.
Properties Held for Sale. Set forth below are the Trust's properties held for sale (primarily obtained through foreclosure), except for a single-family residence, and the monthly rental rate for apartments and the average annual rental rate for commercial properties and occupancy thereof at December 31, 1993 and 1992:
________________________
* Property obtained through foreclosure in 1993. N/A - Not applicable as property is shut down.
In January 1993, the Trust shut down the Lake Highlands Apartments as a result of a change in zoning of the property. No assurance can be given that the Trust will be able to operate the property as an apartment complex in the future. Based on the land value under the current zoning, the Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss in excess of previously established reserves.
In March 1993, the Trust recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the Lakepointe Apartments, a 540 unit apartment complex in Memphis, Tennessee. The Lakepointe Apartments had an estimated fair value (minus estimated costs of sale) of at least $8.3 million at the date of foreclosure. In connection with this insubstance foreclosure, the Trust recorded the $6.7 million mortgage payable secured by the property. The foreclosure resulted in no loss to the Trust in excess of previously established reserves.
Also in March 1993, the Trust recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the Huntington Green Apartments, an 81 unit apartment complex in West Town, Pennsylvania. The Huntington Green Apartments had an estimated
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Real Estate (Continued)
fair value (minus estimated costs of sale) of at least $1.8 million at the date of foreclosure. The foreclosure resulted in no loss to the Trust in excess of previously established reserves.
In 1993, the State of Wisconsin commenced eminent domain proceedings to acquire the Pepperkorn Building, located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, for highway development. The State of Wisconsin's initial offer was $175,000, which is being appealed by the Trust. There is no assurance that the Trust's appeal will be successful or of the amount, if any, of additional compensation that it may receive. However, based on the information presently available, the Trust does not anticipate incurring any losses in excess of previously established reserves.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of the Trust's assets consist of mortgage notes, principally secured by income-producing properties including first, wraparound and junior mortgages. The Trust's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS - Business Plan and Investment Policy."
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Trust's mortgage portfolio at December 31, 1993, consisted of office buildings, apartments, shopping centers, single-family residences, a retirement home and developed land. To the extent the Declaration of Trust does not control such matters, the Trust's Board of Trustees may alter the types of mortgages in which the Trust invests without a vote of the Trust's shareholders. In addition to restricting the types of collateral and priority of mortgages, the Declaration of Trust imposes certain restrictions on transactions with related parties which limits the entities to which the Trust may make a mortgage, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
At December 31, 1993, the Trust's mortgage portfolio included 12 mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $18.1 million, secured by income-producing properties located throughout the United States, 4 mortgage loans with an outstanding balance of $437,000 secured by single-family residences located in the Southwest and Pacific regions of the United States and one mortgage loan with a carrying value of $856,000 secured by 55 acres of land located near Sacramento, California. At December 31, 1993, 6% of the Trust's assets were invested in mortgages (5.1% in first mortgage loans, .2% in a wraparound mortgage and .7% in junior mortgage loans).
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Trust's outstanding mortgages at December 31, 1993. The table does not include the $437,000 in single-family mortgages or the $856,000 mortgage secured by land discussed in the preceding paragraph. See Schedule XII to the Consoli-

dated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of activity in the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1993 is as follows:
First Mortgage Loans. The Trust may make first mortgage loans, with either short, medium or long-term maturities. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Trust's general policy to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Trust may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Trust.
The Trust did not originate or acquire any first mortgage loans during 1993. The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded or otherwise acquired first mortgage loans during 1993:
During 1993, the Trust received payment in full, totaling $2.4 million, on three first mortgages.
At December 31, 1993, two of the Trust's first mortgages were classified as nonperforming. One note, with an outstanding principal balance of $943,000, is secured by an apartment complex located in Paris, Texas. The Trust has obtained a judgment against the maker and guarantors for the amount of this mortgage. The Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss in excess of previously established reserves on this note.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
Another nonperforming first mortgage note with a carrying value of $856,000 and legal balance of $1.2 million at December 31, 1993 is secured by 55 acres of developed land located near Sacramento, California. The borrower on this note has recently confirmed a plan of reorganization, and has begun making principal payments on the note as parcels are sold. In addition, the note was modified to require monthly interest only payments at 9%, increasing to 24% until maturity in February 1999. The Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss on this note as the estimated value of the property is in excess of the total debt on the property.
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, in March 1993, the Trust recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the Huntington Green Apartments, an apartment complex which secured a $2.4 million first mortgage. The foreclosure resulted in no loss to the Trust in excess of previously established reserves. See "Real Estate" above.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Trust may invest in wraparound mortgage loans on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage loan having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Trust's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make first mortgage loans. The Trust did not originate or acquire any wraparound mortgage loans in 1993. The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded or otherwise acquired wraparound mortgage loans during 1993.
As part of the Trust's 1992 acquisition of the general and limited partnership interests in CCP II, the Trust received a wraparound mortgage note secured by the Plaza Jardin, an office building located in El Toro, California. In May 1993, the Trust foreclosed on the property securing the note receivable. Immediately following the foreclosure, the Trust sold the property for $200,000 in cash, subject to the $3.3 million underlying mortgage debt. The Trust recognized a $94,000 gain on the sale of the property.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Trust may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Trust's Declaration of Trust restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Trust's assets. At December 31, 1993, .7% of the Trust's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
The Trust did not originate or acquire any junior mortgage loans in 1993.
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, in March 1993, the Trust recorded the insubstance foreclosure of the Lakepointe Apartments, an apartment complex which secured a $3.8 million junior mortgage loan. The foreclosure resulted in no loss to the Trust in excess of previously established reserves.
At December 31, 1993, four of the Trust's junior mortgages were classified as nonperforming.
A nonperforming junior mortgage note with a principal balance of $256,000 at December 31, 1993 is secured by a retirement center in Tuscon, Arizona. The borrower on this note, Eldercare Housing Foundation ("Eldercare"), is currently in bankruptcy. The Trust does not anticipate incurring losses on this note in excess of previously established reserves. Ted P. Stokely, a Trustee of the Trust, was employed as a real estate consultant for Eldercare from April 1992 to December 1993.
The three remaining nonperforming junior mortgage notes have an aggregate principal balance of $1.3 million and were acquired in a package of similar loans in 1991. All three loans are secured by shopping centers net leased to a major national tenant. The Trust is currently negotiating a settlement of these loans with the owners. The Trust expects that such settlement will not result in any loss in excess of previously established reserves.
Equity Investment in REIT
In December 1990, the Trust's Board of Trustees, based on the recommendation of its Related Party Transaction Committee, authorized the purchase of up to $1.0 million of the shares of beneficial interest of CMET through negotiated or open market transactions. The Trustees of the Trust, except for Messrs. Friedman, Doyle and Weisbrod, are also trustees of CMET. BCM, the Trust's advisor, also serves as advisor to CMET. BCM resigned as advisor to the Trust effective March 31, 1994. At December 31, 1993, the Trust owned 54,500 shares of beneficial interest of CMET which it had purchased through open market transactions in 1990 and 1991, at a total cost to the Trust of $250,000. At December 31, 1993, the market value of such shares was $702,000. Pursuant to an amendment to the Trust's Declaration of Trust approved by the Trust's shareholders, the Trust may hold the shares of CMET until July 30, 1996.
