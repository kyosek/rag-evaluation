ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
Facilities
The principal offices of SRH, Southwest and Red Oak are located in Midland, Texas. SRH, Southwest, and Red Oak believe that their leased and owned properties, none of which individually is material to any of the companies, are adequate for current needs.
Title to Properties
The Company believes it has satisfactory title to all of its properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas and real estate industries. As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Southwest makes only a cursory review of title to farmout acreage and to undeveloped oil and natural gas leases upon execution of any contracts. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a thorough title examination is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects, Southwest, rather than the seller of the undeveloped property, is typically responsible to cure any such title defects at its expense. If Southwest were unable to remedy or cure any title defect of a nature such that it would not be prudent to commence drilling operations on the property, Southwest could suffer a loss of its entire investment in the property. Southwest has obtained title opinions on substantially all of its producing properties and believes that it has satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, Southwest obtains title opinions on a majority of all leases. Southwest's oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens that Southwest believes do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties.
Oil and Gas Properties
Southwest's Principal Oil and Gas Properties
The Company's oil and gas properties are primarily located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Over 95% of the Company's PV-10 Value is concentrated in this region. The region is characterized by numerous known producing horizons, providing significant opportunities to increase reserves, production and ultimate recoveries through additional development, horizontal drilling, recompletions, enhanced recovery methods, and the use of 3-D seismic, reprocessed 2-D seismic data and other advanced technologies. As of December 31, 2000, the Company operated properties comprising approximately 68% of its PV-10 Value.
The following table provides information for the Company's ten largest fields which contribute 62% of its reserves and 55% of its PV-10 Value as of December 31, 2000.
As of December 31, 2000 -------------------------------------- Net Proved PV-10 % of Total Reserves Value PV-10 Field (Mboe) (in thousands) Value ----- ---------------------- -------- Halley 2,772 $52,633 11.12% Foster 4,219 42,608 9.00% Hutto 1,063 25,842 5.46% Huntley 2,851 24,112 5.09% Flying M 3,226 22,360 4.72% Huntley East 2,412 20,315 4.29% Amacker Tippett 878 19,168 4.05% Jo-Mill 2,317 17,637 3.73% Rhoda Walker 1,106 17,395 3.67% Ackerly 2,315 16,960 3.58% ------ ------- ----- Total Top Ten Fields 23,159 $259,030 54.71%

Oil and Gas Reserves. The following table summarizes the estimates of Southwest's historical net proved reserves and the related present values of such reserves at the dates shown. The reserve and present value data for the Company's existing properties as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been prepared by Ryder Scott Petroleum Engineers.
As of December 31, ----------------------------- 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Proved Reserves: Oil and Condensate (MBbls) 25,797 24,828 20,944 Natural Gas (MMcf) 70,375 65,079 58,273 Total (MBoe) 37,526 35,675 30,656 Proved Developed Reserves: Oil and Condensate (MBbls) 18,161 16,618 12,006 Natural Gas (MMcf) 46,592 43,023 37,481 Total (MBoe) 25,926 23,789 18,253

(1) The present value of future net revenues attributable to Southwest's reserves was prepared using prices in effect at the end of the respective periods presented, discounted at 10% per annum on a pre-tax basis.
(2) Discounted future cash flows, including taxes, are not intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties. Estimates of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated future oil and gas prices, interest rate, changes in development and production costs and production costs and risks associated with future production. Because of these considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and imprecise.
In accordance with applicable requirements, estimates of Southwest's proved reserves and future net revenues are made using oil and natural gas sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties (except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation.) The average prices used in the reserve report were $25.62/Bbl of oil and $9.68/Mcf of natural gas, $23.90/Bbl of oil and $2.06/Mcf of natural gas and $10.25/Bbl of oil and $1.73/Mcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues therefrom are affected by oil and natural gas prices, which have fluctuated widely in recent years. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers, including those used by Southwest, may vary. In addition, estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production, results of future development and exploration activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and other factors, which revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based.
In general, the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent Southwest acquires properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities, or both, the proved reserves of Southwest will decline as reserves are produced. Southwest's future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. Exploring for, developing or acquiring new reserves requires substantial amounts of capital.
Net Production, Unit Prices and Costs. The following table presents certain information with respect to oil and gas production, prices and costs attributable to all oil and gas property interests owned by Southwest for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998: As of December 31, ----------------------------- 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Production Volumes: Oil and condensate (MBbls) 1,236 1,306 1,689 Natural gas (MMcf) 4,784 4,627 5,556 Total (MBoe) 2,033 2,077 2,615

Producing Wells. The following table sets forth the number of productive wells in which Southwest owned an interest as of December 31, 2000: Gross Net Wells Wells ------ ------ Oil 6,611 546 Natural Gas 685 73 ----- --- Total 7,296 619
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including gas wells awaiting pipeline connections and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Wells that are completed in more than one producing horizon are counted as one well. A gross well is a well in which an interest is owned. A net well is the fractional working interest in a gross well. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional interest owned in gross wells.
Acreage. The following table sets forth Southwest's developed and undeveloped gross and net leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2000: Gross Net ------ ------ Developed 87,682 25,441 Undeveloped 303,582 102,870 ------- ------- Total 391,264 128,311
Undeveloped acreage includes leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. A gross acre is an acre in which an interest is owned. A net acre is the fractional working interest in a gross acre. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional interests owned in gross acres.
Drilling Activities. The table below sets forth the drilling activity of Southwest on its properties for the periods ending December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Hedging. The revenues generated by Southwest's operations are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for oil and natural gas. The price received by Southwest for its oil and natural gas production depends on numerous factors beyond Southwest's control. Historically the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors. These factors include the level of consumer product demand, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions in the Middle East, the actions of OPEC, the foreign supply of oil and natural gas and overall economic conditions. It is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty.
Southwest, from time to time, uses option contracts to mitigate the volatility of price changes on commodities Southwest produces and sells as well as to lock in prices to protect the economics related to certain capital projects.
On December 30, 1999, Southwest entered into a basket revenue protection agreement, which provides the Company with an oil and gas revenue floor. The contract was for the period January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2000.
