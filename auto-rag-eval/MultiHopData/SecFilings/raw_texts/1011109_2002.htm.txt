ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
General
As of March 19, 2003, we own:
•
seven existing multifamily apartment communities that are stabilized containing a total of 1,632 apartment homes;
•
one community containing 250 apartment homes that is completing its lease-up phase;
•
one community under construction that will contain 319 apartment homes;
•
a 10.9-acre site currently in the planning and design phase on which we intend to build a 220-unit apartment community (referred to in this report as the Northridge apartment land);
•
a 42,090 square foot retail center currently under construction; and
•
a 39,907 square foot office building currently under construction, a part of which we intend to use as our corporate headquarters.
We sold our 9.5-acre East Fox Court land on November 21, 2002. We sold our 152-unit Rosewood Plantation community on January 4, 2001, and our 334-unit Crestmark community on July 11, 2001. We acquired the 200-unit St. Andrews at the Polo Club on November 6, 2001.
We believe that in the long-term the demand for multifamily housing in Atlanta will increase due to Atlanta’s growing population, although recent job losses in Atlanta have resulted in a weaker apartment market. According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which we refer to as the ARC, both population and job growth in Atlanta are projected to be above the national average for the foreseeable future. The ARC is the regional planning and governmental coordination agency for the 10-county Atlanta Region, which is composed of Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton, Rockdale, Henry, Douglas, Cherokee and Fayette counties. Its information also includes Coweta, Forsyth and Paulding counties.
The following information is based on statistical estimates published by the ARC. The estimated population of the Atlanta Region increased by 46.8% from 2,653,600 persons in 1990 to 3,895,200 persons in 2002, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and the largest in the Southeast. The population of the Atlanta Region is projected to grow 8.4% from 3,895,200 persons in 2002 to 4,223,300 persons in 2010.
Housing units in the Atlanta Region increased an estimated 30.5%, from 1,052,430 units in 1990 to 1,373,058 units in 2000. Multifamily homes in the Atlanta Region increased 21.7% from 342,441 units in 1990 to 416,682 units in 2000. The Atlanta Region added 14,823 multifamily units in 2002 and 16,237 units in 2001.
The following table summarizes basic information about our communities.
Annual operating data regarding our stabilized communities at December 31, 2002 are summarized in the following table. The second phases of Preston Oaks, Plantation Trace and Addison Place are described separately for this purpose. Except for those figures noted with an asterisk, the occupancy rates shown represent the average physical occupancy of the applicable community calculated by dividing the total number of vacant days by the total possible number of vacant days for each year and then subtracting the resulting number from 100%. The figures noted with asterisks reflect the applicable data on December 31 of the specified year and are not annualized because the applicable community was under construction and in its initial lease-up period during at least a portion of that year. During lease-up, units are leased as they are constructed and made ready for occupancy building by building, thus annualization of data is not possible during that period. Throughout this table, “N/A” means “not applicable,” i.e., no unit in the community was available to be occupied during the relevant year.
As described below, our Atlanta communities are located in Gwinnett and Fulton counties and four submarkets, or geographic areas, within these counties. We also have one community in Charlotte and one in Palm Beach County, Florida. The Charlotte community now under construction and St. Andrews at the Polo Club are described after the Georgia properties. Each heading identifies the community or communities within the specified county and submarket. We obtained population and employment data for each Atlanta submarket from the ARC. Multiple communities are located in each of the Duluth and Perimeter Center/North Springs submarkets; thus those communities compete not only with unaffiliated apartment communities but also with each other.
Gwinnett County
Gwinnett County was one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. in the 1980’s, and from 1985 until 1990 it ranked first in the nation in growth among counties with a population of more than 100,000. From 1990 to 2002, Gwinnett’s population has increased 79.2% to 638,800 persons. Gwinnett’s strong employment base, transportation networks, excellent public education system and affordable home prices contribute to the county’s growth. Gwinnett is home to approximately 235 international firms, over 860 manufacturing and 1,300 high technology firms that generate many of its 364,196 jobs. The average household income of the county is approximately $91,000. Gwinnett County is home to our communities located in the City of Duluth and unincorporated Gwinnett.
Duluth Area - Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek Communities
Duluth. The City of Duluth is located in western Gwinnett County and is home to our Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek communities.

Plantation Trace. Plantation Trace is a 232-unit garden apartment community that was completed in two phases: a 182-unit first phase in 1990 and a 50-unit second phase in 1998, sometimes referred to below as Phase II. Plantation Trace consists of 31 two and three story Nantucket-style stone and wood sided buildings located on a 29.2-acre site on Pleasant Hill Road approximately one-half mile west of its intersection with Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. In 1990, the 182-unit first phase received the Aurora Award from the Southeast Builders’ Conference for “Best Rental Apartment Community in the Southeast.”
The Plantation Trace community, with its award-winning traditional architecture and landscaped grounds, features a clubhouse, a modern fitness and exercise facility, two lighted tennis courts, sand volleyball court, multi-station playground, two free-form swimming pools, a small wading pool, a stone paver pool deck and a covered whirlpool spa. In addition to upscale amenities, Plantation Trace offers such interior features as nine foot ceilings, crown molding, pickled wood cabinetry in the kitchen and bath, marble vanity tops, fireplaces, vaulted ceilings and Palladian windows in select units, designer wallcoverings and full laundry rooms with washer and dryer connections.

Bradford Creek, which was completed in 1998, consists of 9 two and three story buildings located on an approximately 22.5 acre property near the southeast corner of Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Howell Ferry Road in Duluth, approximately one-mile southeast of Plantation Trace and River Oaks. The Bradford Creek community, with its unique mountain lodge architecture and traditional landscaping, features a large clubhouse with a fitness center, clubroom, laundry room, two lighted tennis courts, free-form swimming pool, stone paver pool deck, a 12-acre nature area, a courtyard highlighted by a water fountain and a gated entrance. In addition to the upscale amenities, Bradford Creek offers such interior features as nine foot ceilings and a computer room in select units, crown moldings, garden tubs, white raised-panel cabinetry in the kitchen and bath, marble vanity tops, breakfast bars, designer wallcoverings and full laundry rooms with washer and dryer connections. Each building was constructed using cobblestone and vinyl siding and offers private patios or balconies along with gables and varying paint colors.
Bradford Creek contains 28 one-bedroom units of approximately 990 square feet each, 46 two-bedroom standard units of approximately 1,302 square feet each, 47 two-bedroom roommate units of approximately 1,344 square feet each and 59 three-bedroom units of approximately 1,579 square feet each.

Fulton County
Fulton County is the largest county in the Atlanta Region in terms of population, employment, housing units and land area.
Perimeter Center/North Springs Area - Preston Oaks. Highland Park and Northridge Communities
Perimeter Center/North Springs. The Perimeter Center/North Springs area offers convenient proximity and access to both urban and suburban employment bases and retail conveniences. Georgia 400 and I-285 provide direct access within minutes to major regional malls such as North Point Mall and Perimeter Center Mall. The Phipps Plaza/Lenox Mall/Buckhead area and downtown Atlanta’s Central Business District are readily accessible via the Georgia 400 extension, which connects to I-85 South near downtown Atlanta.
Within this corridor is a large base of residential, commercial and office developments. The south quadrant of the area includes medical facilities such as Northside Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Perimeter Center encompasses office developments that exceed 18,500,000 square feet of space, with such upscale facilities as Ravinia, Northpark Town Center, Concourse and Perimeter Center Office Park. Several prominent companies such as InterContinental Hotels Group, UPS and Hewlett-Packard have located their worldwide or regional headquarters within the Perimeter Center area.
This area, which includes portions of Fulton and DeKalb Counties, has an average household income of approximately $111,532, which is considerably higher than the metropolitan Atlanta average of $58,568. The median value of a single-family home in this area exceeds $200,000.
Preston Oaks. Preston Oaks is a 213-unit garden apartment community that was completed in two phases: a 189-unit first phase in August 1995 and a 24-unit second phase in 1998. Preston Oaks consists of nine two and three story buildings located on Mt. Vernon Highway in the Perimeter Center area. The traditional architecture consists of stacked stone and vinyl siding incorporating details of gabled roofs, Palladian windows, columns and bay windows.
The community is located on an 11.5-acre site and features extensive landscaping. The amenities are similar to those of our other existing communities, with custom swimming pool, lighted tennis court, fitness center with individual workout stations and a large clubhouse. Interior features include garden tubs, oversized walk-in closets, pickled pine cabinetry in the kitchen and bath, crown molding, mirrored walls and chair railing in the dining rooms. Phase one consists of 36 one-bedroom units, 92 two-bedroom
units and 61 three-bedroom units. Phase two consists of 24 one-bedroom apartment units with 902 square feet each. The weighted average unit size is 1,207 square feet.
Preston Oaks is conveniently located less than one mile from Perimeter Mall, a 1,200,000 square foot regional mall, and in close proximity to the area’s numerous office developments. Several stand-alone restaurants and major retail centers either exist or are being developed near the community.
As of December 31, 2002, Preston Oaks was 98.1% occupied, and its rental rates ranged from $784 to $1,119 per month, resulting in a weighted average monthly rent of $1,025 per unit and $0.85 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $226,000 in 2002.
Highland Park. This community consists of 188 upscale apartment units in a total of eight buildings on a 10.9-acre site. Located on Dunwoody Place in the North Springs area of Sandy Springs, Highland Park benefits from its close proximity to Georgia 400, which provides direct access within minutes to major retail and employment areas to the north such as North Point Mall and the Windward mixed use project, and to the south such as Perimeter Mall and Perimeter Center.
Highland Park has 42 one-bedroom units with 902 square feet, 32 two-bedroom standard units with 1,225 square feet, 62 two-bedroom roommate units with 1,285 square feet and 52 three-bedroom units with 1,440 square feet. The weighted average unit size is 1,232 square feet.
The buildings are of a traditional design with stacked stone accents and vinyl siding with the facades varying from building to building. Exterior features include gables, bay windows, various paint colors with white trim and private patios or balconies. Extensive landscaping includes mature trees, flowers and shrubbery. The interiors feature crown molding in the living/dining rooms, designer wallcoverings, separate laundry rooms, breakfast bars, garden tubs and private balconies. Recreational amenities include a swimming pool, tennis court and fitness center.
As of December 31, 2002, Highland Park was 95.7% occupied, and its monthly rental rates ranged from $739 to $1,050 per month, resulting in a weighted average monthly rent of $974 per unit and $0.79 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $186,000 in 2002.
Northridge. The Northridge community will be located on a 10.9 acre site located adjacent to the Highland Park community. We intend to construct a 220-unit upscale apartment community consisting of one- and two-bedroom apartments with covered parking for residents. We expect to start construction by the end of 2003, and we estimate the total cost to be approximately $24 million.
Alpharetta Area - Addison Place
Alpharetta. The Alpharetta area offers convenient proximity and access to both urban and suburban employment bases and retail conveniences. Georgia 400 provides direct access within minutes to major regional malls such as North Point Mall and Perimeter Center Mall. The Phipps Plaza/Lenox Mall/Buckhead area and downtown Atlanta’s Central Business District are readily accessible via the Georgia 400 extension, which connects to I-85 South near downtown Atlanta.
Within this corridor is a large base of residential, commercial and office developments. North Point Mall’s success accelerated the already high rate of residential development, which caters to the upscale consumer. North Fulton’s prestigious neighborhoods have been a major factor in the emergence of the Georgia 400 corridor as a center for corporate headquarters. Between 1990 and 2002, North Fulton added approximately 143,000 residents and 54,272 housing units. The average household income of North Fulton County in 2002 was $111,000. The Windward project, which straddles Georgia 400, is the
region’s largest mixed-use development. Based on our market research, we believe North Fulton County has been adversely affected by the recent economic downturn. Our indicators include, among others, unemployment rates, apartment
vacancies, business failures and mortgage foreclosures.
Addison Place Phases I and II. Addison Place is a 403-unit community located on Abbotts Bridge Road near the intersection of Abbotts Bridge and Jones Bridge roads. The first phase contains 118 townhouses consisting of 60 two-bedroom townhouses of approximately 1,497 square feet each and 58 three-bedroom townhouses of approximately 1,903 square feet each. The second phase of Addison Place contains 285 garden-style apartment homes. It includes 11 different floor plans, including 60 one-bedroom units ranging from 765 to 1,034 square feet, 147 two-bedroom units ranging from 1,150 to 1,550 square feet, 58 three-bedroom units at approximately 1,706 square feet and 20 four-bedroom units at approximately 2,074 square feet, along with 40 direct-entry garages. The weighted average unit size is 1,498 square feet. The buildings are of a traditional design with stacked stone accents, brick and vinyl siding. The community features two swimming pools, a modern fitness and exercise facility, a business center, men’s and women’s saunas and a playground.
As of December 31, 2002, Addison Place was 75.6% occupied, and its monthly rental rates ranged from $695 to $1,619 per month, with a weighted average monthly rent of $1,103 per unit and $0.74 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $351,000 in 2002.
Charlotte, North Carolina
The following information is based on statistics and estimates published by the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. Between 1990 and 2002, Mecklenburg County’s population grew from 511,363 to 746,427 persons. It is projected to grow to 1,015,141 persons by 2011. Employment has grown 363,640 in 2002. Nine of the nation’s top 200 banks operate in Charlotte, including Bank of America, N.A. and Wachovia Corporation (formerly First Union Corporation). Other major employers include Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System, Duke Energy Corporation and USAirways. Additionally, 286 of the nation’s largest industrial and service corporations listed by FORTUNE magazine have facilities in the area.
Our Charlotte community is located on a 23.8-acre site at the intersection of Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) and John J. Delaney Drive in the Ballantyne area, the largest mixed-use development in Mecklenburg County. This community will have 319 garden-style apartments, consisting of 110 one-bedroom units ranging from 766 square feet to 1,030 square feet, 143 two-bedroom units ranging from 1,144 square feet to 1,550 square feet, 48 three-bedroom units at 1,783 square feet and 18 four-bedroom units at 2,081 square feet, along with 36 direct-entry garages. The weighted average unit size is 1,289 square feet. We estimate the cost of construction on this development to be approximately $30,800,000, of which $24,000,000 is being funded with a construction loan that we obtained in February 2002. The community is located near I-485 and I-77, which offers convenient access to downtown Charlotte and I-85.
Palm Beach County, Florida - St. Andrews at the Polo Club
According to the Palm Beach Development Board, Palm Beach County is the third most populated county in Florida behind Dade and Broward counties to the south. The population of Palm Beach County grew from 870,000 persons in 1990 to 1,165,000 persons in 2001, a 34% increase, and is projected to grow to 1,500,000 persons by 2005. It is considered the most affluent county in Florida. West Palm Beach and Boca Raton are the two largest cities in the county, with the downtown West Palm Beach area undergoing a multi-billion dollar renaissance, which includes the recently completed mixed-use project City Place.
St. Andrews at the Polo Club. St. Andrews at the Polo Club community is located on a 13.7-acre site adjacent to the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club in Wellington, Palm Beach County, Florida. The property is conveniently located 1.5 miles from The Mall at Wellington Green, a new 1.3 million square foot regional mall that opened in October 2001. The 200-unit community includes 160 garden apartments and 40 townhouse units, and each of the 200 units has its own garage. The interiors of each apartment include luxurious features such as nine- and ten-foot-high ceilings, wood-burning fireplaces, crown molding, glass-enclosed showers and a top-of-the-line General Electric appliance package. Amenities for the residents include a swimming pool, spa and gazebo bar area, business center, indoor racquetball court, lighted tennis court and clubhouse with a fitness center.
The unit mix includes 80 two-bedroom garden apartments ranging from 1,223 square feet to 1,404 square feet, 80 three-bedroom garden apartments ranging from 1,492 square feet to 1,627 square feet, and 40 townhouses of approximately 1,427 square feet each. The weighted average unit size is 1,545 square feet. As of December 31, 2002, the property was 90.7% occupied. Rental rates ranged from $975 to $1,492 per month, resulting in a weighted average monthly rent of $1,327 per unit and $0.86 per square foot. Local real estate taxes were $560,000 in 2002.
The table on the following page summarizes the amenities of each of the existing communities and of our Charlotte community, which is now under construction.

Competition
All of the communities are located in developed areas, and numerous other apartment projects are located within the market area of each community. The number of competitive apartment communities in the area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease our apartments at the rental rates anticipated, and we can give no assurances regarding the development of additional competing multifamily communities in the future. The remainder of this section summarizes the competition for each of the communities. The following information reflects our study of apartment communities in each submarket that we believe to be closely competitive with our community or communities within that submarket. This section includes summary information we obtained from various sources - including developers and real estate brokers, as well as on-site visits - regarding those apartment communities. Although we have attempted to verify the information and believe that it is substantially accurate on the whole, information regarding a particular community may be incorrect due to the sources relied upon or erroneous information supplied by competitors.
Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek. The Duluth submarket, which we consider to include the area within a two mile radius from these communities, currently consists of approximately 19 multifamily communities, including River Oaks, Plantation Trace and Bradford Creek. Although the Bridgewater apartment community - which was previously developed and sold by an affiliate of Mr. Roberts - is located more than two miles from Plantation Trace, it is also included in the Duluth market area because it offers units with attached garages and its architecture and amenities are similar to Plantation Trace. Of the approximately 19 existing communities in the area, seven were completed in the last five years, including Bradford Creek and the second phase of Plantation Trace. Due to the quality of construction, age of the communities, type of amenities, resident profiles and rental rates, we believe that only 11 of the other 16 communities are in direct competition with Plantation Trace, River Oaks and Bradford Creek.
Preston Oaks. We believe that the north central Perimeter multifamily submarket includes the area within a two-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by Roswell Road to the west, Ashford Dunwoody Road to the east, Spalding Drive to the north and Glenridge Drive to the south, and it currently consists of approximately 26 multifamily communities, including Preston Oaks. Of the 25 other existing communities in the market area, only six were built before 1983. The remaining 19 communities range from approximately one to 11 years of age. We believe that Preston Oaks competes with all 25 of these communities.
Highland Park and Northridge. We believe the North Springs multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around this community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the north and west, Georgia 400 to the east and Dalrymple Road to the south, and currently consists of 34 communities, including Highland Park. Of the approximately 34 existing communities in the market area, only five have been built since 1989. The remaining communities range in age from 15 years to over 20 years. We believe Highland Park draws residents from all of the other 33 communities located in the market area, but only 11 of the 33 communities compete closely with Highland Park.
Addison Place. We believe the Alpharetta multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the Abbotts Bridge community. It is generally bounded by the Chattahoochee River to the east, Old Alabama to the south, Georgia 400 to the west and Windward Parkway to the north, and it currently consists of approximately 17 communities, including Addison Place. We believe that Addison Place draws residents from all of the approximately 16 other communities located in the market area, which compete closely with Addison Place.
Veranda Chase. We believe the Veranda Chase multifamily submarket includes the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the Veranda Chase community. It is generally bounded by Herrington Road to the east, Club Drive to the south, Steve Reynolds Boulevard to the west and Sugarloaf Parkway to the north and east, and it currently consists of approximately 24 communities, including Veranda Chase. We believe that Veranda Chase draws residents from all of the approximately 23 other communities located in the market area, but due to their amenities, quality of construction and resident profile, only seven of the 23 other communities compete closely with Veranda Chase.
Charlotte. We consider the Charlotte multifamily submarket to include the area within an approximately two-mile radius around the community. It is generally bounded by the Providence Road to the east, Providence Road West to the south, Lancaster Highway (old NC-521) to the west and I-485 to the north, and it currently consists of approximately nine communities, including our community. We believe that once construction of our Charlotte community is complete, it will draw residents from all of the approximately eight other existing communities located in the market area.
St. Andrews at the Polo Club. We consider the West Palm Beach County submarket to include the area within an approximate three mile radius around the community. It is generally bordered by the Florida Turnpike to the east, Lake Worth Road to the south, and Okechobee Road to the north. The submarket consists of six existing apartment communities (including ours), and one new community currently under construction. Of our six competitors, four were built during the last five years. St. Andrews competes with five of the six communities in its market area.
Summary of Debt Secured by Our Properties
See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Summary Schedule, for an explanation of our current debt structure, including for each loan: the principal balance at March 19, 2003 and at its scheduled maturity, interest rate, maturity date, amortization schedule and monthly principal and interest payment.
Possible Additional Communities to Be Developed
From time to time Roberts Properties plans the development of other apartment communities to be located on property owned by Roberts Properties or other affiliates of Mr. Roberts, or on property that one of those entities is interested in acquiring. Mr. Roberts may elect to raise the required equity by syndicating a limited partnership or limited liability company. Alternatively, we may seek to raise the equity required to purchase and develop the community by selling shares. If Mr. Roberts elects to raise equity through a limited partnership or limited liability company, Mr. Roberts may seek to cause the partnership to be merged into the operating partnership at a later date. A transaction of that nature would require the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners of the partnership and of a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors, and we can give no assurances regarding whether Mr. Roberts will ultimately determine to seek a merger in that manner, or whether such a merger would in fact be approved by the requisite majority in interest of limited partners in the partnership and by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board.
See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions - Payments to the Roberts Companies, for more information about the payment of fees to the Roberts Companies in connection with the development and construction of the Charlotte and Northridge communities.
Other Real Estate Assets
In addition to the communities, we also own a retail center and a corporate office building, both of which are under construction. Addison Place Shoppes is a 42,090 square foot retail center at the intersection of Abbotts Bridge Road and Jones Bridge Road in Alpharetta, Georgia and located directly in front of our Addison Place apartment community. We entered into a cost plus 5% contract with Roberts Construction to build the Addison Place Shoppes, which we expect to be completed by the third quarter of 2003.
On June 28, 2001, we acquired a partially constructed office building located adjacent to our Highland Park community and to our Northridge land on which we are developing a new community. The three story, 39,907 square foot building will serve as our corporate headquarters, and we will lease the remaining space to Roberts Properties, Roberts Construction and unaffiliated tenants. We have entered into a fixed cost contract with Roberts Construction to construct the building for $4,670,000, of which $1,616,000 was incurred at closing. We also intend to retain Roberts Construction to perform tenant finish work for approximately $600,000. Roberts Construction will construct the building and the tenant finish work for cost. We expect construction of the office building will be substantially complete by the third quarter of 2003. We expect to begin leasing activities in the second quarter of 2003.
See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions - Payments to the Roberts Companies, for more information about the payment of fees to the Roberts Companies in connection with the development and construction of these projects.
