ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We classify our mineral properties into the reportable segments consistent with the manner in which they are grouped in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 15 Operating Segment Reporting and subdivide them within each segment by their respective stage of development: “Production Properties”, “Advanced-Stage Properties” and “Exploration Properties”. Advanced-stage properties consist of properties for which advanced studies and reports have been completed indicating the presence of economically mineable mineralized material or in some cases, proven and probable reserves, and for which we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining the required permitting. Our designation of certain properties as “Production Properties” or “Advanced-stage Properties” should not suggest that we have proven or probable reserves at those properties as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7.
Our significant production, advanced-stage and exploration properties are described below.
SEGMENT: MEXICO
The following map depicts the location of our major properties included in the Mexico Operations segment, which the El Gallo 1 mine and the El Gallo 2 project described in the sections below:
The following table summarizes the Company’s land position in Mexico as of December 31, 2017:
Production Properties
El Gallo 1 mine, Mexico (100% owned)
For detailed information on the El Gallo 1 mine production statistics and financial results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview and History
We own 100% of the El Gallo 1 mine. The El Gallo 1 mine is the open-pit gold mine and heap leach operation formerly known as the Magistral mine. Modern exploration activities at the Magistral site and surrounding properties started in early 1995 and were carried out by several companies. Commercial production was initiated in 2002 by Nevada Pacific Gold Ltd. and the mine produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold from 2002 to 2005 before it was placed on care and maintenance for economic reasons. We acquired Nevada Pacific Gold in 2007, performed limited exploration activities, refurbished the infrastructure and completed the first gold pour in September 2012, with commercial production commencing on January 1, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the El Gallo 1 mine produced a total of 46,446 ounces of gold and 18,586 ounces of silver, and has produced a cumulative total of 240,149 ounces of gold and 124,878 ounces of silver since recommencement of commercial production.
The El Gallo 1 mine consists of 8 square miles (20 square km) of concessions. Concession titles are granted under Mexican mining law. Mining concessions are subject to annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi-annual basis in accordance with Mexican law. An annual lease agreement for surface access to the El Gallo 1 mine is currently in place.
Location and Access
The El Gallo 1 mine and the surrounding properties are in northwestern Mexico in the western foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, within the State of Sinaloa in the Mocorito Municipality, approximately 60 miles (100 km) by air northwest of the Culiacan, the Sinaloa State capital city. The concessions are located approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) by road from the town of Mocorito, which is approximately 10 miles (16 km) from the city of Guamuchil. Access is by paved or well-maintained two-way dirt roads.
Geology and Mineralization
Mineralization among the various deposits of the El Gallo 1 mine area is generally similar. The mineralized structural zones consist of quartz stockwork, breccia, and/or local quartz veins, all occurring within propylitically altered andesitic volcanic rocks. The mineralization is generally characterized by gold accompanied by iron oxide and variable copper, zinc and lead in sulfides.
Facilities and Infrastructure
The El Gallo 1 mine property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads and high-speed internet access. There is a truck shop, a warehouse, a fuel depot, core logging facilities, an explosives magazine, heap leach pads, process ponds, an assay laboratory, a three stage crushing plant, an ADR process plant and an administrative office. The laboratory is equipped to process all assays (blasthole samples from the mine, core, chips and soil) and incorporates fire assaying, atomic absorption, and ICP-OES equipment. Also included is a metallurgical lab capable of conducting leach bottle rolls and column tests to determine cyanide leaching amenability and gold and silver recoveries of ores amenable to cyanide leaching.
In 2017, we initiated the construction of a sulfidation-acidification recovery (SAR) circuit for the removal of copper, zinc and lead from pregnant leach solutions. This will increase the adsorption efficiency at the ADR plant to recover gold and silver from the pregnant leach solutions obtained from the heap leach. The SAR circuit is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2018.
Mining operations and site security are performed by contractors with company employees in the management, administrative and processing areas.
The primary water supply for the El Gallo 1 mine comes from two operating water wells located 0.9 miles (1.5 km) from the process facility. Wells pump water into a raw water pond, which is then used for operations. The wells combined with
capture of 32 inches (~830 mm) of average local annual precipitation provide sufficient supply for the El Gallo 1 mine production.
Mining activities will cease in the second quarter of 2018 while we expect leaching activities will continue until 2020 or later, as long as it remains economical to do so. Exploration work is ongoing in an effort to extend the mine life beyond 2018 and make new discoveries in the district.
Advanced-stage Properties
El Gallo 2 Project, Mexico (100% owned)
Access and Location
The El Gallo 2 project is located 3.0 miles (4.8 km) northwest of our El Gallo 1 mine.
Overview and History
El Gallo 2 is a prospective silver mining operation. Although there is a long history of mining in the area, only minimal amount of mining appears to have occurred at El Gallo 2 based on field observations. There is no recorded history of prior exploration having occurred at El Gallo 2. We acquired El Gallo 2 and the surrounding mineral concessions in connection with the acquisition of Nevada Pacific Gold in 2007. In 2008, we initiated exploration in the district. After conducting rotary drilling in the area, we were able to confirm the grade and thickness of the silver resource in January 2009.
A feasibility study (‘‘FS’’) was completed on the El Gallo 2 project in September 2012. As a result of changes in commodity prices since the publication of the FS, we are of the view that the 2012 FS is no longer current and should not be relied on. A final decision to proceed with the construction of El Gallo 2 has not been made and alternatives to reduce capital and operating costs continue to be examined. Any decision to proceed would be dependent on improved silver prices, improved project economics, and securing financing on terms that are more favorable than those that were available at the time of completion of the FS. During 2017, we conducted further studies on the feasibility and development of the El Gallo 2 project. However, as of December 31, 2017, no new study has been completed.
Facilities and Infrastructure
El Gallo 1 infrastructure is currently used to support current work on the El Gallo 2. The water supply for the El Gallo 2 project is expected to come from three locally drilled water wells. Required water yields were confirmed through several long-term pumping tests completed in 2013.
Exploration Properties
Our land position of Exploration Properties in Mexico consists of several claims not associated with a specific project, such as Palmarito and Mina Grande. The Palmarito silver deposit is a historic silver mining area that saw historical production from open pit and underground workings before cessation of mining in the 1950s.
Since 2008, exploration activities across the license areas have included prospecting, as well as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling, and most recently an ongoing full district-scale soil geochemistry survey. This work has in some areas leading to more detailed work including large scale mapping, blasthole drilling and ultimately RC and core drilling programs. This stage-gate approach has led to either a steady progression of work in prospective areas or the suspension of work in less favorable areas. The prioritization of targets has continued based on new data and interpretations. Limited exploration was conducted in 2017. We allocated part of the 2018 budget to continue the exploration work, including multiple drill campaigns to evaluate the highest priority soil geochemistry anomalies identified by our district-scale soil sampling program.
SEGMENT: CANADA
The following map depicts the location of our major properties included in the Canada segment, which are the Lexam Properties (Fuller, Davidson Tisdale, Buffalo Ankerite and Paymaster), and the Black Fox Complex, (the Black Fox Property (Black Fox Mine, Grey Fox, Froome), Black Fox-Stock mill and Black Fox North). These properties are described below.
The following table summarizes the Canada land position of our Company as of December 31, 2017:
Production Properties
Black Fox Mine, Canada (100% owned)
For detailed information on the Black Fox Mine production statistics and financial results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview and History
We own 100% of the Black Fox Complex, which includes the Black Fox Mine, Black Fox North and the Black Fox-Stock Mill. We acquired these assets, along with some advanced-stage and exploration properties, in October 2017. The Black Fox Mine refers to the current mining operation and is an underground gold mine. Modern exploration activities at the Black Fox Mine (formerly the Glimmer Mine) started in the late 1990’s.
The Glimmer Mine and surrounding properties started operating in 1997. Commercial production was initiated by Exall Resources Limited and the mine operated over the period 1997 to 2001. Operations were suspended in May 2001 due to low gold prices. The Glimmer Mine was renamed the Black Fox Mine in 2002 and there was no gold production between 2002 and 2008. Brigus Gold Corporation (“Brigus”) restarted the mine following increased gold prices in early 2009. Primero Mining Corp. (“Primero”) acquired Brigus on March 5, 2014. During the period between 2014 and 2016, the mine produced 151,000 ounces of gold. We acquired the property on October 3, 2017, completed the first gold pour in November 2017 and the commercial operations of the mine were unaffected by the acquisition.
The Black Fox Property consists of one block of land comprising 32 parcels and 22 mining titles for a total of 4,324 acres (1,750 hectares) or 6.8 sq. mi (17.5 sq. km). Some parcels and mining titles are subject to royalties. All parcels and mining titles are freehold mining lands (mining patents), mining leases, or licenses of occupation. All required permits are in place.
Location and Access
The Black Fox Complex is located 7 miles (11 km) east of Matheson, Ontario, on Highway 101 East. Matheson, in turn, is located approximately 45 miles (72 km) from Timmins, which has a commercial airport. Access to the mine is either by paved or well maintained, two-way, dirt roads.
Geology and Mineralization
The Black Fox Complex is located within the Abitibi greenstone belt. Gold mineralization at the Black Fox Mine occurs in several different geological environments within the main ankerite alteration zone, and generally occurs as: (1) Free gold associated with shallow dipping quartz veins and stockworks in green carbonate and ankerite altered ultramafic rocks; (2) Gold-bearing pyrite; (3) Gold associated with fine-grained pyrite and (4) Free gold in steeply dipping sigmoidal quartz veins.
Facilities and Infrastructure
The Black Fox Mine property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads and high-speed internet access. There are seven fully serviced modular buildings which support various functions of the underground mine. There is also a maintenance shop, warehouse, compressed air plant, backfill plant and water management facilities. Ore from the Black Fox mine is transported to, and processed at, the Stock Mill, approximately 17 miles (27 km) from the mine.
The primary water supply for the Black Fox Mine comes from an on-site fresh water well, and water produced from dewatering activities is channeled to the holding pond for process recycling and/or discharge through the Black Fox water treatment facility. Current water supplies are adequate to sustain current and planned future operations.
We acquired the Black Fox-Stock Mill as part of the acquisition from Primero in October 2017. The mill is located approximately 17 miles (27 km) from the Black Fox mine and has a nominal processing capacity of 2,500 tpd. Ore is shipped to the mill from the Black Fox mine by truck.
The Black Fox-Stock mill is also the site of the former Stock Mine, which produced 137,000 ounces of gold from an underground operation between 1989 and 2005. The surface facilities remain in place with the underground mine now flooded.
The Stock Mill property has well-developed infrastructure including electricity, roads and high-speed internet access. There are two buildings that support security and administration of the Stock Mill. There is an assay lab and administrative building on site. There are several other buildings to support operations and milling, including a hoist house, warehouse and maintenance shop, mine dry building, crusher and conveyor systems and the mill building itself. The site also houses various support structures including reagent storage and oil storage buildings, reagent distribution building, two standby generator buildings and a potable water building.
We inherited a toll milling agreement with Sage Gold to process ore from the Clavos Gold project.
Reserves
We are in the process of completing our own technical report in respect of the Black Fox mine. In connection with this project we are reviewing this mineral resource.
Metal Streaming Agreement
On November 9, 2010, Brigus entered into an agreement with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (“Sandstorm”) whereby Brigus received up front proceeds of $56.3 million and Sandstorm agreed to purchase 12% of the future gold production from the Black Fox Mine beginning in January 2011 and 10% of future gold production from the Black Fox extension covering a portion of the adjoining Pike River property. Sandstorm also committed to pay Brigus ongoing payments of $500 per ounce purchased, subject to an inflationary adjustment beginning in 2013, but which would not exceed 2% per annum. Brigus had the option, for a 24-month period, to reduce the Gold Stream Agreement to a minimum of 6% of production from the Black Fox Mine and 4.5% of production from the Black Fox Extension (Pike River) for a payment of $36.6 million. On November 5, 2012, Brigus elected to exercise a portion of the option and repurchased 4% of the Gold stream for $24.4 million. This reduced Sandstorm’s portion of future production at Black Fox to 8% and the Black Fox extension to 6.3%. The Sandstorm agreement was assumed by McEwen as part of the acquisition of the Black Fox Complex. The Company is obligated to sell 8% of current and future gold production from the Black Fox mine and 6.3% at the adjoining Pike River property (Black Fox Extension) to Sandstorm at the lesser of market price or $531 per oz (with inflation adjustments of up to 2% per year) until 2090. The upfront proceeds, representing the uncredited balance, were completely repaid prior to the Company’s acquisition of the properties.
Advanced-stage Properties
Grey Fox, Canada (100% owned)
Overview and History
The Grey Fox project is an advanced-stage project. It is also 100% owned by our subsidiary McEwen Ontario. The Grey Fox project is not subject to any streaming arrangements.
An internal feasibility-level study (“Feasibility”) was completed on the Grey Fox project in early 2015 by Primero, which recommended further development of the Grey Fox deposit. At the end of 2015, project engineering, baseline studies, geotechnical evaluations, permitting activities, closure plan preparation, and development of mine designs and production plans as well as cost estimates had advanced sufficiently to initiate consultation with the First Nations, the Metis of Ontario and local communities. Subsequently, Primero stopped development work on the project. A final decision to proceed with development of Grey Fox has not been made and alternatives to reduce capital and operating costs continue to be examined by the Company. Any decision to proceed would be dependent on improved gold price expectations and improved project economics.
Access and Location
The Grey Fox project is located 2.2 miles (3.5 km) south of Black Fox Mine, and is directly adjacent to Kirkland Lake’s Hislop mine. Access is either by paved or well maintained, two-way, dirt roads.
Facilities and Infrastructure
There is no infrastructure at the Grey Fox property.
Froome, Canada (100% Owned)
Overview and History
The Froome project was discovered by Primero in early 2015.
Access and Location
The Froome deposit is located 0.6 miles (1 km) west of the Black Fox Mine. The deposit is accessible by either paved or well maintained, two-way, dirt roads.
Facilities and Infrastructure
Due to the proximity of Froome to the Black Fox mine, existing infrastructure from Black Fox can be utilized on this project. We will continue evaluating to determine the viability of future production from this deposit.
Exploration Properties
We acquired the Lexam properties in connection with the acquisition of Lexan in April 2017. Each of these properties (Buffalo Ankerite, Davidson Tisdale, Fuller and Paymaster) is adjacent to either a previous mining operation or an existing one. There is limited infrastructure on the properties. The company is evaluating synergies that could come as a result of using the Black Fox - Stock Mill to process material from these properties, which is about 30 miles (50 km) away from the mill to the west.
Buffalo Ankerite, Canada (100% Owned)
We control a 100% interest in the Buffalo Ankerite Property, which is located 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southeast of Timmins, in northeastern Ontario. Production took place between 1926 and 1953 and included a 4,000 ft. (1,220 meter) deep shaft. In early 2007, Lexam began exploring for both near surface and deep gold mineralization.
Fuller, Canada (100% Owned)
The Fuller Property is comprised of 13 claims covering 519 acres (210 hectares) in Tisdale Township, approximately 3 km southeast of Timmins, Ontario.
Paymaster, Canada (61.01% Owned)
In June 2008, Lexam entered a four-year option agreement with Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”) to acquire a 60% interest in 15 patented mining claims that are adjacent to and on strike of the gold mineralized zones situated on the Fuller Property and the Buffalo Ankerite Property. In June 2012, Lexam completed its earn-in requirements and acquired a 60% interest in the Paymaster Property. On September 20, 2013, Lexam received formal notification from Goldcorp indicating that they would not participate in the 2013 exploration program. As Goldcorp continued its nonparticipation in subsequent years, Goldcorp’s 40% ownership was diluted in accordance with terms stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2017, McEwen increased its interest in the Paymaster Property to 61%.
Davidson Tisdale, Canada (100% Owned)
We own 100% of the Davidson Tisdale property, covering 1,134 acres (460 hectares) from 25.5 claims. The Davidson Tisdale Property hosts gold in the Main Zone and the S-Zone mineralized structures, which are developed by a 550 foot (168 meter) deep decline ramp with five mine levels. Permitting activities have been carried out over previous years. Upon completion of additional permitting, we envision a surface bulk sample as the initial mining work, leading to an open pit operation before the commencement of underground mining. Additional exploration potential exists at depth, below the underground mine workings.
Other Exploration Properties
Black Fox North, Canada (100% Owned)
We own 100% of the Black Fox North property, covering 207.7 acres (84 hectares) from 10 claims, and located 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Black Fox Mine. The Black Fox North Property is underlain by mafic and felsic volcanic flows to the northeast and sedimentary rocks to the southwest. The volcanic and sedimentary sequences are separated by the northwest-southeast striking Pipestone Fault. The Pipestone fault is known to host mineralization. To date, no gold mineralization has been identified on the property. Soil surveys across the property, as well as the presence of bimodal volcanism, suggest the potential for base metal mineralization on the property.
SEGMENT: MINERA SANTA CRUZ (“MSC”)
The following map depicts the location of our major properties included in the MSC segment which are the San José mine and other concessions located around the mine:
Production Properties
San José mine, Argentina (49% owned)
For detailed information on the San José mine production statistics and financial results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview and History
The San Jose mine is an underground gold and silver mining operation. We acquired our interest in the San José mine in connection with our acquisition of Minera Andes in January 2012. The property is owned and operated under an option and joint venture agreement (“OJVA”) between Minera Andes (49%) and Hochschild (51%) in the name of MSC. The
property was acquired by Minera Andes in 1997, following the completion of a regional geological study. Minera Andes carried out an intensive exploration program from 1997 to 2001, leading to the discovery of the Huevos Verdes and Saavedra West Zones. A feasibility study was completed in October 2005 under the direction of MSC and the decision to proceed to production was made on March 28, 2006. Plant, infrastructure construction and mine development continued from July 2006 to September 2007 and commercial production was declared on January 1, 2008.
The San José mine is an underground operation located approximately 12 miles (20 km) north of Goldcorp’s Cerro Negro project in the northwest corner of the Deseado Massif region in the Province of Santa Cruz in Argentina. The mine is part of a larger property which covers a total area of approximately 1,074 sq. miles. (2,781 sq. km) and consists of 135 mining concessions
Location and Access
The San José property is in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, lying approximately between latitude 46°41’S and 46°47’S and longitude 70°17’W and 70°00’W. The mine is 1,087 miles (1,750 km) south-southwest of the city of Buenos Aires and 217 miles (350 km) southwest of the Atlantic port city of Comodoro Rivadavia. The principal access route to the San José property is a paved highway from Comodoro Rivadavia unto an unsealed 20-mile (32 km) two-lane dirt road section to the mine. Comodoro Rivadavia has regularly-scheduled air services to Buenos Aires. The nearest town is Perito Moreno, which is approximately 19 miles (30 kilometers) west of the San José property. The main structural trend of fault and vein systems on the property is in directions within the northwest quadrant.
Geology and Mineralization
The San José property is in the Deseado Massif, which consists of Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks uncomfortably overlain by Middle to Upper Jurassic bimodal andesitic and rhyolitic volcanics and volcaniclastics. Cretaceous sediments and Tertiary to Quaternary basalts overlie the Jurassic volcanics. The Jurassic Bajo Pobre Formation is the main host of gold and silver vein mineralization at the mine. The formation is comprised of a lower andesite volcaniclastic unit and an upper andesite lava flow and has a maximum thickness of 394 ft. (120 meters). Mineralization in the San José area occurs as low sulfidation epithermal quartz veins, breccias and stockwork systems accompanying normal-sinistral faults striking 330° to 340°.
Facilities and Infrastructure
Infrastructure at the property consists of camp facilities that can accommodate up to approximately 1,100 personnel, a medical clinic, a security building, a maintenance shop, a laboratory, processing facilities, a mine and process facility warehouse, a surface tailings impoundment, support buildings and mine portals, a change house, a core warehouse, an administration building and offices. The laboratory is equipped to process all assays (core, chips and soil) and incorporates fire assaying and atomic absorption equipment. MSC has installed a satellite-based telephone/data/internet communication system.
Electricity is provided by an 81-mile (130 km) 132 kV electric transmission line, which was constructed in 2009 and connects the San José mine processing facility to the national power grid.
The San José mine is a ramp access underground mining operation.
Exploration Activities
MSC has purchased the land and corresponding occupation rights that are necessary to conduct its operations. All of the known mineralized zones, mineral resources and mineral reserves and active mine workings, existing tailing ponds and waste are within MSC’s concessions.
During 2017, approximately 33,661 feet (10,260 meters) were drilled in Aguas Vivas, Juanita, Platífero and Nueva-1 areas. For 2018 the approved budget considers approximately 24,803 feet (7,560 meters) in the San José area. In 2017, MSC secured surface land access for exploration and eventual mine development if successful through a 30-year agreement with the land owners. However, if the Aguas Vivas results from 2017 and the drilling in the San José area have positive results then additional meters will be drilled in 2018.
Reserves
The reserves information for the San José mine as at December 31, 2017, on a 100% basis, was prepared by Hochschild and audited by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. (“P&E”). In its report dated February 4, 2018, P&E concluded that the reserve estimates for the San José mine prepared by Hochschild provide a reliable estimation of reserves in accordance with the standards of the Joint Ore Reserve Committee of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (“JORC”), NI 43-101, the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) best practices and SEC Industry Guide 7.
The mineral reserves were estimated using metal prices of $1,200 per ounce of gold and $16.5 per ounce of silver with a marginal revenue cut-off value of $101.63 per tonne. The reserves, as presented, are in-place and include mining dilution and mining losses, but do not include allowances for mill or smelter recoveries.
The following table summarizes 100% of proven and probable gold and silver reserves of the San José mine, as of December 31, 2017:

The following table summarizes the land position of our properties in Nevada as of December 31, 2017:
Advanced-stage Properties
Gold Bar Project, Nevada (100% owned)
Overview and History
The Gold Bar Project is a proposed open pit gold mine with an oxide heap leach recovery circuit. Construction work commenced in late 2017 following receipt of the final permit.
The property is located within the Battle Mountain-Eureka-Cortez gold trend in Eureka County, central Nevada. The property was previously mined from 1987 to 1994 by Atlas Precious Metals Inc. We commenced the formal permitting process to recommence mining in 2012.
On February 15, 2018, we announced the results of a definitive FS, which will be filed on SEDAR. The FS is compliant with NI 43-101 and the reserve estimate is compliant with SEC Industry Guide 7. Based on the FS, initial capital expenditures for the project are estimated at $80.8 million including an allocation of $4.6 million for contingencies.
Location and Access
The Gold Bar project is in the Roberts Creek Mountains, in Eureka County, Nevada, approximately 30 miles (48 km) northwest of the town of Eureka, Nevada, primarily in Township 22 North, Range 50 East (N39°48’16.5”; W116°21’09.65”). The project site is accessed by traveling 25 miles (40 km) west on US Highway 50 from Eureka, the nearest town. Travel is then 16 miles (26 km) north on the Three Bars Road, a gravel, all-weather road maintained by Eureka County. The project area is approximately 15 miles (24 km) from the end of Three Bars Road, and is accessed through unimproved dirt roads that are not maintained by the county.
Geology and Mineralization
The project is located in the Battle Mountain-Eureka mineral belt in a large window of lower-plate carbonate rocks surrounded by upper-plate rocks. The lower-plate carbonates consist of an east-dipping section of Silurian Lone Mountain Dolomite, Devonian McColley Canyon Formation, Devonian Denay Formation, and Devonian Devils Gate Limestone (from oldest to youngest). Gold mineralization is hosted primarily in the Bartine Member of the McColley Canyon Formation, which consists of carbonate wackestones and packstones approximately 250 to 380 feet thick. Minor amounts of mineralization are found in the underlying dolomitic limestone Kobeh Member of the McColley Canyon Formation where it is adjacent to apparent feeder structures. The area where the project is located has “Carlin-Type” sediment-hosted gold mineralization characteristics with typical associated alteration (decalcification, silicification).
Facilities and Infrastructure
At present, temporary facilities and infrastructure exist at the Gold Bar project site in support of ongoing construction activities. These items include a temporary water supply and power generation, as well as modular offices.
Gold Bar Project construction began immediately upon receipt of the final permit on November 8, 2017. Key activities conducted during November and December 2017 were:
·
Engineering and procurement of major capital equipment items;
·
Onsite mobilization of all major contractors;
·
Site clearance and initial preparation for 2018 civil work was largely completed;
·
Installed temporary offices, communications equipment, water, and power;
·
Began installation of mine water supply system;
·
Mine development underway at Cabin Creek pit, which will be the initial source of production.
Exploration Activities
Since the formal permitting process began in 2012, we did not perform any drilling activities within the production area subject to the Plan of Operations (“POO”). We did, however, drill and pump-tested one potential water well location for future mining operations. We drilled 33 holes in 2015 which were primarily in previously disturbed areas of the pit. No other exploration occurred between 2016 and November 2017. In December 2017, a series of near pit limit exploration targets were initiated at the Gold Bar project. The total program footage will be determined by program success. The program is expected to continue throughout the first quarter of 2018.
Permitting Activities
The Gold Bar project is fully permitted for construction. State permits required for operations are all expected to be received prior to commencement of operations, which is expected for the fourth quarter of 2018.
Proven or Probable Reserves
The mineral reserves at the Gold Bar project were estimated using gold price of $1,000 per ounce, and a cut-off grade of 2.26 g/t. The reserves, as presented, are in-place and include mining dilution and mining losses, but do not include allowances for mill or smelter recoveries. The reserve estimate was prepared by Independent Mining Consultant of Tucson, Arizona.
The following table summarizes estimated proven and probable gold reserves recoverable of the Gold Bar project, as of December 31, 2017:
Exploration Properties
Tonkin property (100% owned)
The Tonkin property represents our largest holding within the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend in Eureka County, Nevada with approximately 43 sq. miles (113 sq. km). The Tonkin property consists of the Tonkin Springs deposit and the previously operating Tonkin mine.
From 1985 through 1989, the Tonkin mine produced approximately 30,000 ounces of gold utilizing an oxide heap leach and a separate ball mill involving bio oxidation to treat refractory sulphide ore. Due to cost escalation and recovery issues, the operation was shut down and not restarted. The mine site is currently on care-and-maintenance and we continue to advance the reclamation program. We also continue evaluation work with respect to the Tonkin Springs deposit. No significant drilling took place in 2017.
Other Exploration Properties
No significant drilling or exploration activities took place in any of these properties during the year 2017. The Company continues to rationalize its mineral property interests in Nevada in an effort to focus its exploration efforts on prospective areas.
SEGMENT: LOS AZULES
Exploration Properties
The following map depicts the location of our major exploration properties in the Los Azules segment in two distinct exploration projects at Los Azules and Chonchones, in the province of San Juan in Argentina. Los Azules is the more advanced and significant project at this time.
The following table summarizes the land position related to Los Azules segment as of December 31, 2017:
Los Azules Copper Project, Argentina (100% owned)
Overview and History
The Los Azules copper project is a 100% owned advanced-stage porphyry copper exploration project located in the cordilleran region in the province of San Juan, Argentina near the border with Chile. In 1994, Minera Andes acquired lands in the southern portion of the Los Azules area. Over the years there was additional exploration done by Minera Andes and other companies who owned adjacent properties around Los Azules. We acquired this property, along with other Argentina exploration properties and our interest in the San José mine, as part of with the acquisition of Minera Andes in January 2012.
Location and Access
The project is located at approximately 31o 13’30” South latitude and 70o 13’50” West longitude and about 4 miles (6 km) east of the Chile-Argentina border. It is accessible by unimproved dirt roads with seasonal closures in winter. The elevation at the site ranges between 11,500 feet to 14,750 feet (3,500 meters to 4,200 meters) above sea level.
Geology and Mineralization
The deposit is located within a copper porphyry belt that is host to some of the world’s largest copper mines. The upper part of the system consists of a barren leached cap, which is underlain by a high-grade secondary enrichment blanket. Primary mineralization below the secondary enrichment zone has been intersected in drilling up to a depth of more than 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) below surface.
Exploration Activities
Drilling conditions in the area are difficult, especially due to the presence of highly faulted zones and areas of loose surface scree or talus. Due to snow conditions on two mountain passes on the access road to the site, seasonal exploration typically commences in December and extends into late April or early May. Drilling programs have been undertaken at Los Azules between 1998 and 2014 and in 2017 by four different mineral exploration companies: Battle Mountain Gold (now Newmont Mining Inc.), Mount Isa Mines S.A. (now Glencore Plc.), Minera Andes and McEwen Mining. Drilling, including early reverse circulation programs, focused initially on gold exploration and subsequently on diamond drilling for porphyry style copper mineralization. From 1998 until the second quarter of 2013, a total of 201,764 ft. (61,141 m.) were drilled on the property. No significant drilling took place between third quarter of 2013 and fourth quarter of 2016 as we focused on baseline studies regarding flora, fauna, water quality and other environmental compliance matters. In 2017, a total of 21,451 ft. (6,500 m.) was drilled bringing total drilling done to date at Los Azules to 223,215 ft. (67,641 m.)
During the third quarter of 2017 we completed an updated 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”), results of which were announced on September 7, 2017.
Facilities and Infrastructure
There are currently limited facilities or infrastructure located at the project site which mainly includes portable camp structures and drill platforms.
Other Exploration Properties
Our other exploration properties are located in the Province of San Juan. No significant exploration activities took place during 2017.
