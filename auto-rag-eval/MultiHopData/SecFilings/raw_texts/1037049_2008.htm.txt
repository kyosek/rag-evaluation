Description of Properties
Office Premises
We conduct our activities from our principal and technical office located at Baarerstrasse 10, 1st Floor, Zug, 6300, Switzerland. These offices are provided to us on a month to month basis. We believe that these offices are adequate for our purposes. We do not own any real property or significant assets. Management believes that this space will meet our needs for the next 12 months.
Mining Properties
Our properties are in the preliminary exploration stage and do not contain any known bodies of ore.
We conduct exploration activities from our principal and technical office located at Baarerstrasse 10, 1st Floor, Zug, 6300, Switzerland. The telephone number is (+41) 7887-96966. We believe that these offices are adequate for our purposes and operations.
Our strategy is to concentrate our efforts on: (i) existing operations where an infrastructure already exists; (ii) properties presently being developed and/or in advanced stages of exploration which have potential for additional discoveries; and (iii) grass-roots exploration opportunities.
We are currently concentrating our property exploration activities in Brazil and Canada. We are also examining data relating to the potential acquisition of other exploration properties in Latin America, South America.
Our properties are in the exploration stage only and are without a known body of mineral reserves. Development of the properties will follow only if satisfactory exploration results are obtained. Mineral exploration and development involves a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There is no assurance that our mineral exploration and development activities will result in any discoveries of commercially viable bodies of mineralization. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our exploration programs, which may be affected by a number of factors. Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
We currently have an interest in three (3) projects located in Tapajos gold province in Para State, Brazil and one property located in British Columbia, Canada. We have conducted only preliminary exploration activities to date and may discontinue such activities and dispose of the properties if further exploration work is not warranted.

Geology
Granites of the Pararui Intrusive Suite, long known to host significant precious metal mineralisation, dominate the local geology, with occasional later granitic stocks of the Maloquinha intrusive suite. Sub vertical mineralized quartz veins with widths from 20 cm to 60 cm strike between 310 and 330, mimicking the regional structural trend. Recent samples of these veins assayed between 17 and 25.9 g/t Gold.
Previous work on the project is limited to alluvial mining of the tributaries of the Surubim, and many areas of primary mineralization of pyrite associated with gold have been uncovered as a result.
The Surubim River Valley, connecting the Santa Lúcia and Santa Isabel properties, was the focus of intense alluvial mining with an estimated 200,000 m3 of alluvial material grading greater than 1g/t, with material near the Santa Isabel border grading up to 3g/t. These figures are more than triple the grades generally mined by artisanal methods in the Tapajos, suggesting a high-grade proximal source.

The option agreement can be terminated at any time upon written notice to the vendor and we will be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due.
Geology
The geology of the Sao Domingos property is predominantly composed of paleo-proterozoic Parauari Granites that play host to a number of gold deposits in the Tapajos Basin. Typical Granites of the younger Maloquinha Intrusive Suite have been noticed in the vicinity of Molly Gold Target, and basic rocks considered to be part of the mesoproterozoic Cachoeira Seca Intrusive Suite occur around the Esmeril target area.
The São Domingos property was a previous large alluvial operation, and the property area covers numerous areas of workings. The Company has outlined four (4) prime targets, Atacadao, Esmeril, Molly Gold Target and Cachoeira for the São Domingos drilling project. All targets are located around a series of regional brittle and ductile structures trending NW, NE and NNW within the Parauari Intrusive Suite and adjacent to the later Cachoelra (Gabbroic) Intrusive Suite. The Parauari Intrusive Suite has proven to host the vast majority of gold deposits elsewhere within the Tapajos Gold Province. This area has also previously been the focus of large-scale alluvial workings.
Preliminary investigation of all four (4) target areas has confirmed the existence of mineralized quartz veins and stockwork systems within these Intrusive Granite Suites.
The Atacadao area is an alluvial system and is the result of gold being shed from the surrounding granitic topographic highs. These hills are part of the Pararui Intrusive Suite, and locally contain well-developed mineralized stock work quartz veins. Numerous production shafts are located on the flanks of the hills, trending along a major property scale east/west fault and we are confident of the potential for further mineralisation at depth. Preliminary investigations proved the local topographic highs to be part of the Parauari Intrusive Suite with well-developed stock work quartz. Initial inspection of the quartz veins showed them to be clearly mineralized and final results of initial sampling confirmed high grades of gold, up to 42.56g/t Gold with 20g/t silver within the quartz stock works. Locally, previous shallow, up to 10 meter production shafts focused on an E-W sub-vertical, project scale brittle structure, which can be traced for several hundreds of meters, and is thought to link up to the high grade occurrences at the Molly Gold Target project a distance of approximately 5 km.
Esmeril was the centre of recent mining activity targeting the highly oxidised fraction of the porphyritic host rock. The stockwork veins, exposed by previous workers, show boxwork and fresh sulphides and generally associated with ferruginous staining of both the veins and the enclosing country rock.
The Molly Gold Target area was also the centre of a large-scale development of both the alluvials and oxidised host rocks, using the common water canon and sluice method. This area is also located on an East - West structure and further investigations are underway to test if this structure forms part of the East - West system leading from Atacadao giving a strike potential of several km. Property scale dominant structures are all generally East -West.
Within the project area the main structures strike NE-SW to E-W. Nearly all documented quartz veins and vein rock zones run parallel to this general tectonic trend suggesting the mineralisation is frequently related to the fracturing of the host rocks. Gold, silver, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, millerite, malachite and azurite are common minerals found within the rocks of the project area.
The Molly Gold Target lies NNE of Sao Domingos. It consists of a water filled pit that was created by artisanal miners exploiting an E-W striking qtz vein and adjacent stockwork system. Water ingress and poor wall stability have beaten local miners and mining has ceased except for the re-washing of old stockpiles. For this reason no in-situ samples of vein rocks and alteration envelopes could be taken. Mineralized rocks of Molly Gold Target are also anomalous in copper and oxidised specimens show abundant azurite and malachite. Stockpile rock and tailings samples have yielded gold grades ranging from 2 g/t to 20 g/t.
Diamond drilling has defined an E-W striking qtz vein over approximately 300m strike length. It appears that this structure, which is in the order of 0.5 to 1m wide and hosted within the Parauari Granites, is the core of the mineralized zone at Molly Gold Target. Around the ‘high grade’ core of qtz veining associated sulphides and weakly developed stockwork is a ‘low grade’ alteration halo at Molly Gold Target the degree of mineralization seems to be a direct function of vein intensity and as the stockwork is poorly developed the associated mineralization is extremely variable.
São João - Samba Minerals farm in agreement
In May 2008 the Company signed an agreement with Samba Minerals Limited (“Samba”), which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the São João project by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, the Company will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest in the property to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property. Samba can terminate its participation by providing the Company 30 days notice in writing. Upon withdrawal from its participation, Samba would forfeit to the Company all of its rights in relation to the project and would be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Samba will be the manager of the São João project. A feasibility study has not been completed as of December 31, 2008 and thus no joint venture has been formed as of that date.
Location and access
The Sao Joao property is located in the central portion of the Southern Tapajos basin and is accessed by light aircraft from the regional centre of Itaituba. Access is also possible by unsealed roads linking up to the Transgarimpeiro highway and by a purpose cut heavy vehicle access track linking Sao Joao to the exploration centre at the primary project at Sao Domingo.
Tenure
The project covers an area of 5.160 hectares and was granted in 1994 and 2005 as exploration license number 851.533/1994 to 851.592/1994 and 850.091/2005 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral, and expires in 2010.
Option Agreement
The São João option agreement allows us to perform geological surveys and assessment work necessary to ascertain the existence of possible mineral deposits which may be economically mined and to earn a 100% interest in the São João property mineral rights via structured cash payments.
The total option agreement payments for the license are structured as follows:
The vendor will have a 1.5% Net Smelter Royalty. The Royalty payment can be purchased at any time upon written notice to the vendor and payment in Reals (Brazilian currency) of the equivalent of USD $1,000,000. The option agreement can be terminated at any time upon written notice to the vendor and we will be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due.
Geology
The prime targets for the São João property are located around and on the intersection of regional NW and NNW faults within the Pararui Intrusive Suite and this area has been the focus of large-scale alluvial workings. The Pararui Intrusive Suite has proven to host the vast majority of gold deposits elsewhere within the Tapajos Gold Province. We conducted a rock chip program over an area currently being excavated for gold in quartz systems via shallow underground workings. The sample results have demonstrated that the quartz vein systems are highly mineralized and considered continuous for at least 200m. We are confident that the quartz vein systems are much more extensive and are currently planning to increase the sample density of rock and soil sampling over, and adjacent to, the current workings to locate further mineralized vein systems, and to drill test their depth extensions in the near future.
Previous mining activity over a number of years focused on the alluvial deposits within its many tributaries, and has now progressed to include the saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins.
Comandante Araras - Samba Minerals farm in agreement
In May 2008 the Company signed an agreement with Samba, which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the Commandante Araras projects by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, the Company will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property. Samba can terminate its participation by providing the Company 30 days notice in writing. Upon withdrawal from its participation, Samba would forfeit to the Company all of its rights in relation to the project and would be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Samba will be the manager of the Commandante Araras project. A feasibility study has not been completed as of December 31, 2008 and thus no joint venture has been formed as of that date.
Location and access
The Comandante Araras property is located in the central portion of the Southern Tapajos basin and is accessed by light aircraft from the regional centre of Itaituba. The project adjoins the Sao Joao project to the south east.

Location and access
In February 1999, we acquired, by staking, a high grade limestone property three (3) square kilometres (741 acres) located on the north shore of Kumealon Inlet, 54 kilometres south-southeast of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada.
This property is highlighted by consistence of purity and whiteness of the limestone zone outcropping along the southwest shore of Kumealon Lagoon. The zone is comprised mostly of white, recrystallized, fine to course grained limestone, striking 150 degrees and can be traced for at least 1200 meters. The zone is estimated to have an average stratigraphic thickness of 180 meters. Chip samples taken across the zone averaged 55.06% CaO, 2.11% insolubles and 43.51% ignition loss. This property has no known reserves.
We have conducted only preliminary exploration activities on these properties. None of the foregoing properties contain any known reserves.
