The property is used as a variety store by McCrory Corporation pursuant to a net lease executed in December of 1962. During February 1992, McCrory Corporation filed a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code and, as of the date of filing this report, has not yet made an election as to whether it would affirm or reject the lease. Since that date, McCrory Corporation has continued making monthly rental payments through 1995. The current lease term expires on January 31, 2000.

In addition, the tenant has three five-year options at a rental during each option of $205,264 per annum. The first five-year option has been exercised. On January 16, 1981, the lease was assigned to the Zayre Corp., to be operated as a Zayre Department Store. As a result of the acquisition of Zayre Corp. by Ames Department Stores, Inc., the latter succeeded to the tenant's position under

The mortgagee, in addition to the regular monthly payments due under the mortgage, participates in 25% of the gross income over $1,160,000. In February 1981, for $525,000 the Registrant purchased a 13.907% limited partnership interest in XXI Office Plaza Associates, a partnership that was formed to acquire the subject property.

The Grove Office Park consists of three two-story office buildings lying on six acres of land located in Wheaton, Illinois. The complex contains 105,454 square feet of prime office space with parking available for 343 cars.
The Registrant has invested a total of $931,000 to acquire 981 limited partnership units (a 23.08% interest) in M&J/Grove Limited Partnership ("M&J/Grove"). As a Class A Limited Partner, the Registrant is entitled to an 8% cumulative priority claim. On April 18, 1991, M&J/Grove purchased the third building of the complex. The $4,300,000 purchase price along with the refinancing of the two existing loans was accomplished via a new $8,000,000 nonrecourse first mortgage and $1,500,000 in unsecured debentures. The $8,000,000 first mortgage matures May 1, 1996, and bears interest only at
9.25% per annum for two years (monthly payments of $61,666.67). The remaining three years are based on a 9.25% per annum interest, with principal payments based on a 28-year amortization (monthly payments of $66,723). The unsecured debentures of $1,500,000 mature April 18, 1996, and bear interest at 12% per annum payable quarterly. As a result of the combined effects of a 20% vacancy factor and declining rental rates in a soft market, the operating partnership was unable to keep debt service current. Negotiations are being conducted relative to the possibility of a restructuring of the terms of the loan.
On December 31, 1993, the Registrant acquired seven units (a 3.02% interest) in Wilkow/Grove Partners L.P., which has a 5.87% interest in M&J/Grove.

In July 1993, Lake Cook Development entered into an agreement to exchange its ownership of Building IV for a 58.50% undivided interest in the Dover Farms Apartments. Based on this interest, the Registrant will likely need to fund its share of the required capital investment, which will be $72,378. The complex was in the process of being taken back by its mortgagee, which asked Lake Cook Development to step in and acquire the property subject to its mortgage debt. The apartments were completed in 1991 and consist of 300 unfurnished one- and two-bedroom apartments. There are 18 three-story buildings on a site located on a hilly, landscaped setting in North Royalton, Ohio. Each apartment has a washer and dryer, as well as either a patio or terrace.
