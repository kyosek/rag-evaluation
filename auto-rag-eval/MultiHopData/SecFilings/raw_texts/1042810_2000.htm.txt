PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, LEASING AND RELATED SERVICE BUSINESS
	The Company's property management, leasing activities and operating and administrative functions including construction, data processing, finance and accounting are administered or coordinated by Company personnel. On-site functions such as maintenance, landscaping, sweeping, plumbing and electrical are subcontracted at each location, with the cost of these functions passed on to the tenants to the extent permitted by the underlying leases. Personnel from the Company's corporate headquarters conduct regular inspections of each property and maintain frequent contact with major tenants.
	The Company maintains an active leasing and maintenance program that, combined with the quality and locations of the properties, has made the Existing Properties attractive to tenants. The Company intends to continue to hold the Existing Properties for long-term investment and, accordingly, places a strong emphasis on quality construction and an on-going program of regular maintenance. The Existing Properties have been designed to require minimal ongoing capital expenditures.
	The Company's management information systems provide operating data necessary to make informed business decisions on a timely basis. These systems allow instant access to vacancies, lease data, tenants sales history, cash flow budgets and forecasts to enable the Company to maximize cash flow from operations and closely monitor corporate expenses.
	In addition to managing the Existing Properties, the Company provides management and leasing services to certain properties that are owned by third parties. These services are provided pursuant to contracts that are of varying lengths of time and which generally provide for management fees of up to 5.0% of monthly base rent property receipts, leasing commissions of $1 to $3 per square foot and various other fees. The management contracts are typically cancelable upon 30 days notice or upon the occurrence of certain events, including the sale of the property. During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Company earned management fees of $144,196, $263,205, and $635,430, respectively, in connection with its management of third-party owned properties.
COMPETITION
	There are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, including REITs such as Regency Realty Corporation, Weingarten Realty Investors and IRT Property Company, and other owners of real estate in the areas in which the Company's properties are located that compete with the Company in seeking land for development, properties for acquisition, financing and tenants. Many of such competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company. All of the Company's Existing Properties are located in developed areas that include other Supermarket Centers and other retail properties. The number of retail properties in a particular area could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to lease vacant space and maintain the rents charged at the Existing Properties.
REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE
	Regulations. Retail properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations. The Company believes that each of the Existing Properties maintains all required material operating permits and approvals.
Insurance. Under their leases, the Company's tenants are generally responsible for providing adequate insurance on the property they lease. The Company believes that its properties are covered by adequate fire, flood and property insurance, all provided by reputable companies. However, certain of the Company's properties are not covered by disaster insurance with respect to certain hazards (such as hurricanes) for which coverage is not available or available only at rates which, in the opinion of the Company, are not economically justifiable.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, Chapter 403 of the Florida Statutes, the Florida Dry Cleaning Contamination Clean-Up Act and the Miami-Dade County (Florida) Pollution Protection Ordinance, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. Many such laws, including CERCLA, typically impose such liability without regard for whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless divisible with a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. The owner of a contaminated site also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such site. In connection with the (direct or indirect) ownership, operation, management and development of real properties, the Company is generally considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property.
	Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances also govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos-containing materials ("ACM's") when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for release of ACM's and may permit third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of such properties for personal injury associated with ACM's. Some of the environmental site assessments conducted at the Existing Properties to date indicate that a number of the Existing Properties contain ACM's. The Company is not aware, however, of any ACM's at the properties that are friable or in otherwise poor condition.
	The Company believes that the environmental studies conducted to date have not revealed any significant environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and funds from operations (the "FFO"); however, no assurance can be given that environmental studies obtained by the Company reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of land or a property owned or acquired by the Company did not create any material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist (or may not exist in the future). Tenants at the Company's properties include plant-on-premises dry cleaners, gasoline service stations and tire centers, photo development firms and other retailers which use hazardous substances in their businesses. Although leases with such tenants contain provisions intended to minimize environmental risks and to shift the financial risks to the tenants, there is no assurance that the Company will not incur liability in this regard.
	A limited monitoring program with respect to groundwater testing has been implemented at Plaza Del Rey based on questions raised by environmental studies conducted at the time of purchase. Groundwater impacts have also been detected at Atlantic Village, which is located in an area where a former municipal landfill was operated. Buried refuse consistent with known landfill parameters has been identified by the Company's consultants on the Atlantic Village site. While the Company does not regard these sites as significant environmental risks, if a material environmental condition does in fact exist (or exists in the future) at these or other properties, it could have a significant adverse impact upon the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and FFO. No assurance can be given that the environmental studies that were performed at the properties would disclose all environmental liabilities thereon, that any prior owner thereof did not create a material environmental condition not known to the Company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of the properties.
	As noted, tenants at the shopping centers include plant-on-premises dry cleaners. As a result of prior environmental site assessments, low levels of perchloroethylene have been detected in soils at the Company's Commonwealth, Fort Caroline and Eustis Square properties. The Company understands that the owners of these cleaners are applying to participate in the state-funded dry cleaners program. In connection with the Company's acquisition of Skylake, a Phase two Environmental Site Assessment dated July 15, 1997 has revealed the existence of perchloroethylene at levels above regulatory limits caused by a dry cleaning business operated on the premises. The Company has learned that the site is included in the Florida Dry Cleaners State Program, and as a condition to the Company's purchase of the property, the seller agreed to pay all remediation costs, which environmental consultants have estimated to be approximately $250,000. The seller placed $500,000 into an escrow account at closing to pay for the remediation costs. Based on the remediation cost estimates, guarantees by the seller to pay for the clean-up and the establishment of the escrow account, the Company has concluded that Skylake does not pose a material environmental liability.
EMPLOYEES
	At December 31, 2000, the Company had 45 full-time employees. The Company's employees are not represented by a collective bargaining group, and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
