ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development, and land or land options held for development. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and costs as of the beginning of the prior year. We determine which of our communities fall into the Established Communities category annually as of January 1st of each year and maintain that classification throughout the year. For the year 2002, the Established Communities were communities that had stabilized occupancy and costs as of January 1, 2001 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, as described below, within the current year. We consider a community to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities are all other completed communities that have stabilized occupancy and are not conducting or planning redevelopment activities. Other Stabilized Communities therefore include communities that were either acquired or achieved stabilization after January 1, 2001 and that were not conducting or planning to start redevelopment activities within the current year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize all related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of these new developments.
As of December 31, 2002, our communities were classified as follows:
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
Current Communities
The Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The Current Communities, as of February 1, 2003, include 106 garden-style, 17 high-rise and 14 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:
Other features at various communities may include:
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
These Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate all of the Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we completed construction of 2,521 apartment homes in ten communities for a total cost of $466,600,000. The average age of the Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 8.1 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of February 1, 2003, we own:
•
a fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 112 operating communities, one of which is on land subject to a land lease expiring in March 2142;
•
a general partnership interest in three partnerships that each own a fee simple interest in an operating community;
•
a general partnership interest in four partnerships structured as “DownREITs,” as described more fully below, that own an aggregate of 17 communities;
•
a membership interest in four limited liability companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community; and
•
a 100% interest in a senior participating mortgage note secured by one community, which allows us to share in part of the rental income or resale proceeds of the community.
We also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the Development Communities, a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds a fee simple interest in a Development Community and a general partnership interest in two partnerships structured as “DownREITs” that each own one Development Community.
In each of the six partnerships structured as DownREITs, either we or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. Each DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of redemption. In lieu of cash, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock. As of February 1, 2003, there were 975,751 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities
As of February 1, 2003, we had 12 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 3,429 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $645,700,000. Statements regarding the future development or performance of the Development Communities are forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:
•
we will complete the Development Communities;
•
our budgeted costs or estimates of occupancy rates will be realized;
•
our schedule of leasing start dates, construction completion dates or stabilization dates will be achieved; or
•
future developments will realize returns comparable to our past developments.
You should carefully review the discussion under “Risks of Development and Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this Item 2.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.
(1)
Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the first full quarter of 95% or greater physical occupancy after completion of construction.
(4)
This community is owned by a limited liability company in which we are a majority equity holder. The costs reflected above exclude construction and management fees due to us. This limited liability company is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
(5)
The total budgeted cost for this community is net of approximately $4,000,000 of proceeds that we estimate we will receive upon the sale of transferable development rights associated with the development of the community. These rights do not become transferable until construction completion and there can be no assurance that the projected amount of proceeds will be achieved.
(6)
The community is owned by a DownREIT partnership in which one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner with a majority equity interest. This partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
Redevelopment Communities
As of February 1, 2003, we had two communities under redevelopment. We expect the total budgeted cost to complete these communities, including the cost of acquisition, capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment, to be approximately $197,800,000, of which approximately $28,200,000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and $5,800,000 has been invested since acquisition unrelated to redevelopment. Statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the Redevelopment Communities are forward-looking statements. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedules for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. See the discussion under “Risks of Development and Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this Item 2.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
(1)
Acquisition cost includes capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition unrelated to redevelopment.
(2)
Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to redevelop the respective Redevelopment Community, including costs to acquire the community, reconstruction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated redevelopment overhead and other regulatory fees determined in accordance with GAAP.
(3)
Reconstruction completion dates are estimates.
(4)
Restabilized operations is defined as the first full quarter of 95% or greater physical occupancy after completion of reconstruction.
Development Rights
As of February 1, 2003, we are considering the development of 38 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a leasehold interest, or for which we hold a purchase option. We generally hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 11 of the Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 9,950 upscale apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own. At December 31, 2002, there were cumulative net capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $31,461,000 relating to Development Rights. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $78,688,000 are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2002. These land costs include $19,939,000 associated with two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and were planned for disposition as of December 31, 2002.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to pursue, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform
financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however we cannot guarantee a recovery. To recognize the possibility of such loss, we recognize a charge to expense to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized pre-development costs. The determination of a charge to expense relative to pursuits involves management judgment regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to development. The amount charged to expense and reflected in operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements related to possible abandoned pursuits was $2,800,000 and $2,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Because we intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new developments, other financing alternatives may be required to help finance the development of those Development Rights scheduled to start construction after January 1, 2003.
Although the development of any particular Development Right cannot be assured, we believe that the Development Rights, in the aggregate, present attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of long-term stockholder value.
Statements regarding the future development of the Development Rights are forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:
•
we will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary governmental approvals or the financing required to develop these communities, or that we will decide to develop any particular community; or
•
if we undertake construction of any particular community, that we will complete construction at the total budgeted cost assumed in the financial projections in the following table.
The following presents a summary of the 38 Development Rights we are currently pursuing:
Risks of Development and Redevelopment
We intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment home communities. Our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to the following:
•
we may abandon opportunities we have already begun to explore based on further review of, or changes in, financial, demographic, environmental or other factors;
•
we may encounter liquidity constraints, including the unavailability of financing on favorable terms for the development or redevelopment of a community;
•
we may be unable to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations;
•
we may incur construction or reconstruction costs for a community that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other expenses, which could make completion of development or redevelopment of the community uneconomical;
•
occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed development or redevelopment community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and general economic conditions, and may not be sufficient to make the community profitable; and
•
we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs.
The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect our ability to achieve our projected yields on communities under development or redevelopment and could affect results of operations and our payment of distributions to our stockholders.
Construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time. Although we attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions, we cannot predict with certainty what those changes will be. Construction costs have been increasing and, for some of our Development Communities, the total construction costs have been or are expected to be higher than the original budget. Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including:
Costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. We cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs.
Capitalized Interest
In accordance with GAAP, we capitalize interest expense during construction or reconstruction until a building obtains a final certificate of occupancy. Interest that is incurred thereafter and allocated to a completed apartment
home within the community is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 totaled $29,937,000 and $27,635,000, respectively.
Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments
Acquisitions of Existing Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired two communities. The Promenade, located in Burbank, California, contains 400 apartment homes and was acquired for a total price of $70,300,000, which includes the assumption of $33,900,000 of floating-rate, tax-exempt debt. Avalon Greyrock, located in Stamford, Connecticut, contains 306 apartment homes and was acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated third party for a total acquisition cost of approximately $69,900,000.
One DownREIT partnership was formed since January 1, 2002 in conjunction with the acquisition of land by that partnership.
Sales of Existing Communities. We seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:
•
apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;
•
reduce operating expenses; and
•
leverage management talent.
To achieve this increased concentration, we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable, like-kind exchange transaction. We sold one community, totaling 277 apartment homes, since January 1, 2002. Net proceeds from the sale of this asset were $78,454,000.
Land Acquisitions and Leases for New Developments. We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2002, we acquired the following land parcels which are currently held for future development:
(1)
Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees determined in accordance with GAAP.
(2)
Future construction start and completion dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or are not economically feasible. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, we could lose our capital invested in a community, as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. If an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with, or court ordered damages to, that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.
We have noted that the insurance and reinsurance markets have worsened as compared to the prior year, which we believe have resulted in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector. Although we will continue to maintain commercially reasonable insurance coverage, we believe that the cost of such coverage will increase at a faster rate than other operating expenses.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. A large concentration of our communities lie near, and thus are susceptible to, the major fault lines in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the San Andreas fault and Hayward fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In November 2002, we renewed our earthquake insurance. We have in place with respect to communities located in California, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence. Earthquake coverage outside of California is subject to a $100,000,000 limit, except with respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence. In
addition, up to an annual aggregate of $2,000,000, the next $400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional deductible.
Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on August 1, 2002. Although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year, the level of our deductible and premiums costs has increased. Including the costs we may incur as a result of deductibles, we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003 to increase approximately $1,200,000 as compared to the prior period.
Our property insurance, which includes the earthquake coverage as previously described and builder’s risk, was renewed on November 1, 2002, with an increase in the annual premium of approximately $1,100,000 over the prior period.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been recent reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In November 2002, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000, with the first $15,000,000 of damage costs payable by us. Our general liability policy provides coverage (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities. In connection with TRIA, we purchased third party liability terrorism insurance for communities with greater than 24 floors, which were previously excluded under our general liability policy.
We cannot assure that we will have full coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities. See discussion under “Environmental Matters” included in Item 1 of this report.
In March 2003, we expect to renew our directors and officers insurance (“D&O”). In the past year, the D&O market has experienced increased and high profile claim activity. We estimate that our costs for this insurance will increase approximately 80% at renewal.
Americans with Disabilities Act
The apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” and/or “commercial facilities” as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. The Americans with Disabilities Act does not, however, consider residential properties, such as apartment communities, to be public accommodations or commercial facilities, except to the extent portions of such facilities, such as leasing offices, are open to the public. We believe our properties comply in all material respects with all present requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable state laws. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
ITEM 3.
