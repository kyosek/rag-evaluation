●Location and Access
The property is almost entirely within the boundaries of the municipality of Tonopah Nevada. The property is readily accessible via Highway 95 from Las Vegas to the South or Hwy’s 95/6 from the North/West from Northern Nevada/Reno or Bishop California, and from Highway 6 from the east which intersects highway 95 in the heart of Tonopah. This mine can be accessed by dirt roads using an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) or four-wheel drive vehicle and a GPS, main dirt roads leading through the mining district are maintained, but two track roads to the individual mines are often difficult to traverse. Caution is mandatory within the entire valley as it is dotted with abandoned mines - some of them are easy to see from a distance, and other are impossible to see until you are right on top of them. 20% of them are roped or fenced off - the rest do not have safety barriers and one should be extremely careful in entering them. Being situated in the high desert there are limited water sources in the area throughout 10 months out of the year.
●Regional Geology
Tonopah is located slightly inboard of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and on the eastern margin of the “Walker Lane”, a zone of Miocene structural deformation trending northwest to southeast parallel to the trend of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Eastern California. The Walker Lane can best be characterized as a broad zone of abundant strike-slip right-stepping faulting. The trend of the pre-Tertiary geologic units over much of the Walker Lane exhibits an arcuate pattern as a result of the influence of two major structural regimes. A series of these arcs have been identified by past workers with the Tonopah area having been identified as being within the Silver Peak-Palmetto- Montezuma Oroflex (Albers & Stewart 1972). The oroflex is described as southward convex with bedding, fold axes and faults trending to the northwest in the Silver Peak Range, trending east-west in the Palmetto Mountains and swinging around to the Northeast in the Montezuma Peak region. The Tonopah area lies on the eastern limb of the oroflex. The Walker Lane is also noted as being particularly well endowed with mineral deposits and the coincidence of these two structural regimes has created favorable plumbing, which is responsible for the high frequency of deposits in the region.
To the west of Tonopah, the White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene. The early geology of the general Tonopah region is relatively simple with the earliest Cambrian and Precambrian rocks comprised primarily of distal maritime facies - limestones, and dolomites with some hornfelsed shales. These are in fault contact with Ordivician limestones, argillites and shales. From this point in time forward things become increasingly complex due to extensive volcanism in possibly alternating terrestrial and lacustrine settings. None of the Cambrian or Precambrian rocks outcrop in the immediate Tonopah area but fragments of these lithologies are present in volcanic breccias locally, so it is believed they form the basement of the volcanic complex.
● Property Geology
The local geology is extremely well documented with geological investigations going back as early as 1905 when Spurr first published his voluminous observations of the camp. Spurr continued his work in the camp well into the 1920’s, followed by Bastin and Laney (1918), and later Nolan in 1930 published a study of the mines in the western part of the camp, and later expanded on this work, publishing a study that encompassed the entire camp in 1935. Later work was done in the area by Bonham (1970) and Bonham & Garside (1974 & 1979) during the time that work was carried out by Summa, Tenneco, and Houston Oil and Minerals. The earlier workers in the area had the distinct advantage of having the bulk of the mine workings available at one time or another for inspection, while the later workers had the ability to draw from all the earlier well-documented work.
Given the nature of this primarily felsic volcanic center, and the considerable alteration that has taken place prior, during and possibly somewhat after the mineralizing events, the geology of the camp is quite complex, and deciphering the history of the geology and mineralization of the area is only possible due to the thorough the attention paid to detail and the recording of these findings by earlier workers.
●Mineralization
The “Early” andesite of the Mizpah formation is almost exclusively the host rock for mineralization, however Bonanza style lode mineralization of the epoch does extend into the later andesite and in certain mines above the Mizpah into the Extension Breccia, the West End Rhyolitic intrusive and into the Fraction Tuff. From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff. At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold- silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3 m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.
●Previous Exploration Work
No significant exploration has been noted at these mines in a few decades so a historical account of publicly found data was assimilated. The Tonopah Mining District began circa 1900 with the discovery of gold and silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler when he went looking for a lost burro he owned. The burro had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping. When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at the beast, but instead noticed the rock was unusually heavy. He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history. While Butler may have been responsible for the first ore strike, it took men of wealth and power to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah.
George Wingfield, a 24-year old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons. Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and to file for a gaming license. In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah, which spurred a boycott in China of U.S. goods. By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million. When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank. They grub staked miners with friend Nick Abelman, bought existing mines, and by the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, , Nixon and Wingfield were worth over $30 million. Small mining ventures continue to this day to provide income for local miners.
The discovery and development of the Tonopah area can be separated into four periods. From 1900 to 1903 the various participants acquired their ground and commenced development work by sinking shafts to access the ore. Between 1903 and 1907 development continued and better and more efficient equipment was deployed to increase production. The recession of 1907 to 1910 caused production to drop off as only the higher-grade ore could be profitably mined with silver prices dropping to as low as $0.25/oz. During this period many of the weaker companies went out of business and consolidation of claims occurred. The high point of the Tonopah camp occurred between 1910 and 1930 with production peaking around 1918 at 622,364 tons/year, with a recorded value of $9,311,560, and declining steadily through the 1920’s.
Production came to a halt with the exception of leasehold mining in the 30’s due to the depression and low precious metals prices. There was virtually no activity during the war in the 40’s but there was somewhat of a resurgence of activity in the 50’s. In total the Tonopah area produced in the order of 174 million ounces of silver, and 1.86 million ounces of gold from approximately 8.8 million tons of ore. Sporadic exploration has continued in the general area with new prospects being discovered including the Hall Molybdenum Mine, the Midway, Three Hills, and Hasbrouck gold prospects.
By January of 1901 there were between 40 and 50 lessees working leases granted by Butler et al, which consisted of 100 feet of vein and 50 feet to either side. It is problematic to determine exactly what production came from which claim or lease as typically several were amalgamated by a single company, and quite often the underground workings connected from one claim to the next. Often a shaft on one claim was used pretty much exclusively while a nearby shaft on the same groups of claims sat idle. It is likely impossible to ascertain or differentiate what production came from a single source or ascribe in many cases the full significance of some of these veins especially as quite often the production from one mine was brought to surface at another shaft, and not reported in a segregated manner.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C of the NI 43-101 Technical Report.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.

●Local Infrastructure
Nearby geological attractions include Lunar Crater, the Sump and Monte Cristo’s Castle and there are five wilderness areas within hours of the community. The nearby Tonopah Test Range is the town’s main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas over the last half dozen decades as a nuclear test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the Nighthawk. Its location about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway, the town has done fairly well. The Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming. Numerous restaurants, shops, gas stations and motels means it is a perfect place for staging while you work this mine.
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.

●Regional Geology
Tonopah is located slightly inboard of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and on the eastern margin of the “Walker Lane”, a zone of Miocene structural deformation trending northwest to southeast parallel to the trend of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Eastern California (Figure 7.1). The Walker Lane can best be characterized as a broad zone of abundant strike-slip right-stepping faulting. The trend of the pre-Tertiary geologic units over much of the Walker Lane exhibits an arcuate pattern as a result of the influence of two major structural regimes. A series of these arcs have been identified by past workers with the Tonopah area having been identified as being within the Silver Peak-Palmetto-Montezuma Oroflex (Albers & Stewart 1972). The oroflex is described as southward convex with bedding, fold axes and faults trending to the northwest in the Silver Peak Range, trending east-west in the Palmetto Mountains and swinging around to the Northeast in the Montezuma Peak region. The Tonopah area lies on the eastern limb of the oroflex. The Walker Lane is also noted as being particularly well endowed with mineral deposits and the coincidence of these two structural regimes has created favorable plumbing, which is responsible for the high frequency of deposits in the region.
To the west of Tonopah, the White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene.

From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff.
At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.
●Previous Exploration Work
This mine was cut in 1908 as far as our research could determine. But it was worked for 23 years prior to 1940. The mine appear to have been a medium-sized operation - maybe by 2 to 3 miners at the most based on the size of the workings. When part of the General Thomas Mine was split up into smaller properties for sale (owned by the Tonopah-Belcher Mining Co. at that time as well as the General Thomas Of Tonopah Co. before the split), this mine was likely called the Tonopah-Belcher Mine. Classified by a 1904 USGS report as a “past producer of Gold, Lead, Silver (Primary) and Copper (Secondary) -this area is a legendary part of Tonopah that has history dating as far back as 1863 when the district was founded.

●Local Infrastructure
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.
● Property Infrastructure
The Fat Mule Flats mine shows 88 feet deep with 700 feet of tunnels, drifts and crosscuts on 2 separate levels. The wood collar looks like it is still in pretty good shape, but the head frame is long gone.

●Regional Geology
Tonopah is located slightly inboard of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and on the eastern margin of the “Walker Lane”, a zone of Miocene structural deformation trending northwest to southeast parallel to the trend of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Eastern California. The Walker Lane can best be characterized as a broad zone of abundant strike-slip right-stepping faulting.
The trend of the pre-Tertiary geologic units over much of the Walker Lane exhibits an arcuate pattern as a result of the influence of two major structural regimes. A series of these arcs have been identified by past workers with the Tonopah area having been identified as being within the Silver Peak-Palmetto- Montezuma Oroflex (Albers & Stewart 1972). The oroflex is described as southward convex with bedding, fold axes and faults trending to the northwest in the Silver Peak Range, trending east-west in the Palmetto Mountains and swinging around to the Northeast in the Montezuma Peak region. The Tonopah area lies on the eastern limb of the oroflex. The Walker Lane is also noted as being particularly well endowed with mineral deposits and the coincidence of these two structural regimes has created favorable plumbing, which is responsible for the high frequency of deposits in the region.
To the west of Tonopah, the White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene. The early geology of the general Tonopah region is relatively simple with the earliest Cambrian and Precambrian rocks comprised primarily of distal maritime facies - limestones, and dolomites with some hornfelsed shales. These are in fault contact with Ordivician limestones, argillites and shales. From this point in time forward things become increasingly complex due to extensive volcanism in possibly alternating terrestrial and lacustrine settings.
None of the Cambrian or Precambrian rocks outcrop in the immediate Tonopah area but fragments of these lithologies are present in volcanic breccias locally, so it is believed they form the basement of the volcanic complex.
●Property Geology
The local geology is extremely well documented with geological investigations going back as early as 1905 when Spurr first published his voluminous observations of the camp. Spurr continued his work in the camp well into the 1920’s, followed by Bastin and Laney (1918), and later Nolan in 1930 published a study of the mines in the western part of the camp, and later expanded on this work, publishing a study that encompassed the entire camp in 1935. Later work was done in the area by Bonham (1970) and Bonham & Garside (1974 & 1979) during the time that work was carried out by Summa, Tenneco, and Houston Oil and Minerals.
The earlier workers in the area had the distinct advantage of having the bulk of the mine workings available at one time or another for inspection, while the later workers had the ability to draw from all the earlier well-documented work. Given the nature of this primarily felsic volcanic center, and the considerable alteration that has taken place prior, during and possibly somewhat after the mineralizing events, the geology of the camp is quite complex, and deciphering the history of the geology and mineralization of the area is only possible due to the thorough the attention paid to detail and the recording of these findings by earlier workers
●Mineralization
The “Early” andesite of the Mizpah formation is almost exclusively the host rock for mineralization, however Bonanza style lode mineralization of the epoch does extend into the later andesite and in certain mines above the Mizpah into the Extension Breccia, the West End Rhyolitic intrusive and into the Fraction Tuff. From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff.
At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.
●Previous Exploratory Work
No significant exploration has been noted at these mines in a few decades so a historical account of publicly found data was assimilated. The Tonopah Mining District began circa 1900 with the discovery of gold and silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler when he went looking for a lost burro he owned. The burro had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping. When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at the beast, but instead noticed the rock was unusually heavy. He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history. While Butler may have been responsible for the first ore strike, it took men of wealth and power to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah.
George Wingfield, a 24-year old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons. Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and to file for a gaming license. In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah, which spurred a boycott in China of U.S. goods. By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million. When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank. They grub staked miners with friend Nick Abelman, bought existing mines, and by the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, Nixon and Wingfield were worth over $30 million. Small mining ventures continue to this day to provide income for local miners.
The discovery and development of the Tonopah area can be separated into four periods. From 1900 to 1903 the various participants acquired their ground and commenced development work by sinking shafts to access the ore. Between 1903 and 1907 development continued and better and more efficient equipment was deployed to increase production. The recession of 1907 to 1910 caused production to drop off as only the higher-grade ore could be profitably mined with silver prices dropping to as low as $0.25/oz. During this period many of the weaker companies went out of business and consolidation of claims occurred. The high point of the Tonopah camp occurred between 1910 and 1930 with production peaking around 1918 at 622,364 tons/year, with a recorded value of $9,311,560, and declining steadily through the 1920’s.
Production came to a halt with the exception of leasehold mining in the 30’s due to the depression and low precious metals prices. There was virtually no activity during the war in the 40’s but there was somewhat of a resurgence of activity in the 50’s. In total the Tonopah area produced in the order of 174 million ounces of silver, and 1.86 million ounces of gold from approximately 8.8 million tons of ore. Sporadic exploration has continued in the general area with new prospects being discovered including the Hall Molybdenum Mine, the Midway, Three Hills, and Hasbrouck gold prospects.
By January of 1901 there were between 40 and 50 lessees working leases granted by Butler et al, which consisted of 100 feet of vein and 50 feet to either side. It is problematic to determine exactly what production came from which claim or lease as typically several were amalgamated by a single company, and quite often the underground workings connected from one claim to the next. Often a shaft on one claim was used pretty much exclusively while a nearby shaft on the same groups of claims sat idle. It is likely impossible to ascertain or differentiate what production came from a single source or ascribe in many cases the full significance of some of these veins especially as quite often the production from one mine was brought to surface at another shaft, and not reported in a segregated manner.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.

●Local Infrastructure
Nearby geological attractions include Lunar Crater, the Sump and Monte Cristo’s Castle and there are five wilderness areas within hours of the community. The nearby Tonopah Test Range is the town’s main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas over the last half dozen decades as a nuclear test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the Nighthawk. Its location about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway, the town has done fairly well. The Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming. Numerous restaurants, shops, gas stations and motels means it is a perfect place for staging while you work this mine.
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.

Mine 4 - Jasper
Pursuant to the Purchase and Merger Agreement of September 17, 2019, the Company acquired an undivided one hundred percent (100%) interest and deed in and to certain mineral interests found in the Jasper Mine Property located in Tonopah, Nevada in Esmeralda County.
● The Indicated/Unproven/Estimated Gross gold resources are 1,141,774.55 oz based on projected 200 feet excavation.
●Property Description and Ownership
Jasper Mine is a lode mine as well as an open-pit mine. As defined by the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, deposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries. They also include other rock in- place bearing valuable minerals and may be broad zones of mineralized rock. Examples include quartz or other veins bearing gold or other metallic minerals and large volume, but low-grade disseminated gold deposits. Descriptions are by metes and bounds surveys beginning at the discovery point on the claim and including a reference to natural objects or permanent monuments. Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1500 feet in length, and a maximum width of 600 feet (300 feet on either side of the vein).
As defined by Anglo-American, open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, is a surface mining technique that extracts minerals from an open pit in the ground. Open-pit mining is the most common method used throughout the world for mineral mining and does not require extractive methods or tunnels. This surface mining technique is used when mineral or ore deposits are found relatively close to the surface of the earth. Open-pits are sometimes called ‘quarries’ when they produce building materials and dimension stone.
The general course of this claim is North and South, and it is situated in the Southeast Quarter of Section 1, Township 1N, Range 40E, Mount Diablo Meridian, Esmeralda County, Nevada. This claim is 600 feet in width and 1,500 feet in length. This claim runs from the location monument on which this location notice is posted approximately 1,200 feet in a Northerly direction to the North end line and approximately 300 feet in a Southerly direction to the South end line. This claim is marked by four (4) monuments, one at each corner of the claim. Additionally, there are two (2) end-line markers on each side of the center of the claim. All markers are 4” x 4” wooden posts that are buried 1.5’ in the ground and protrude 4.5’ above the ground embossed with the name of the claim and its location in relation to the claim. The location monument on which this notice is posted is situated within Section 1, Township 1N, Range 40E, Mount Diablo Meridian, Esmeralda County Nevada and this claim encompasses portions of the following quarter section (s), Township (s) and Range (s); NE 1/4 of SE 1/4, NW 1/4 of SE 1/4, SE 1/4 of SE 1/4 and SW 1/4 of SE 1/4 of Section 1, T1N, R40E, Mount Diablo Meridian, Esmeralda County Nevada. The locality of this claim with reference to some natural object or permanent monument and additional information (if any) concerning its locality are as follows: SE corner of this claim is 990 Feet West and 825 Feet North of the SE corner of Section 1, T1N, R40E. Beginning at the SE corner of this claim thence 1,500 feet due north to the NE corner of this claim, thence 600 feet due west to the NW corner of this claim, thence 1,320 feet due south to the SW corner of this claim, thence due east 600 feet back to the place of beginning, the SE corner.

●Location and Access
The property is almost entirely within the boundaries of the municipality of Tonopah Nevada. The property is readily accessible via Highway 95 from Las Vegas to the South or Hwy’s 95/6 from the North/West from Northern Nevada/Reno or Bishop California, and from Highway 6 from the east which intersects highway 95 in the heart of Tonopah. This mine can be accessed by dirt roads using an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) or four-wheel drive vehicle and a GPS, main dirt roads leading through the mining district are maintained, but two track roads to the individual mines are often difficult to traverse. Caution is mandatory within the entire valley as it is dotted with abandoned mines - some of them are easy to see from a distance, and other are impossible to see until you are right on top of them. 20% of them are roped or fenced off - the rest do not have safety barriers and one should be extremely careful in entering them. Being situated in the high desert there are limited water sources in the area throughout 10 months out of the year.

Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.

●Local Infrastructure
Nearby geological attractions include Lunar Crater, the Sump and Monte Cristo’s Castle and there are five wilderness areas within hours of the community.
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.
●Property Infrastructure
There are remains of what is believed to be a good-sized cabin outside.

●Location and Access
The property is almost entirely within the boundaries of the municipality of Tonopah Nevada. The property is readily accessible via Highway 95 from Las Vegas to the South or Hwy’s 95/6 from the North/West from Northern Nevada/Reno or Bishop California, and from Highway 6 from the east which intersects highway 95 in the heart of Tonopah. This mine can be accessed by dirt roads using an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) or four-wheel drive vehicle and a GPS, main dirt roads leading through the mining district are maintained, but two track roads to the individual mines are often difficult to traverse. Caution is mandatory within the entire valley as it is dotted with abandoned mines - some of them are easy to see from a distance, and other are impossible to see until you are right on top of them. 20% of them are roped or fenced off - the rest do not have safety barriers and one should be extremely careful in entering them. Being situated in the high desert there are limited water sources in the area throughout 10 months out of the year.
●Regional Geology
Tonopah is located slightly inboard of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and on the eastern margin of the “Walker Lane”, a zone of Miocene structural deformation trending northwest to southeast parallel to the trend of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Eastern California. The Walker Lane can best be characterized as a broad zone of abundant strike-slip right-stepping faulting. The trend of the pre-Tertiary geologic units over much of the Walker Lane exhibits an arcuate pattern as a result of the influence of two major structural regimes. A series of these arcs have been identified by past workers with the Tonopah area having been identified as being within the Silver Peak-Palmetto- Montezuma Oroflex (Albers & Stewart 1972). The oroflex is described as southward convex with bedding, fold axes and faults trending to the northwest in the Silver Peak Range, trending east-west in the Palmetto Mountains and swinging around to the Northeast in the Montezuma Peak region. The Tonopah area lies on the eastern limb of the oroflex. The Walker Lane is also noted as being particularly well endowed with mineral deposits and the coincidence of these two structural regimes has created favorable plumbing, which is responsible for the high frequency of deposits in the region.
To the west of Tonopah, the White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene. The early geology of the general Tonopah region is relatively simple with the earliest Cambrian and Precambrian rocks comprised primarily of distal maritime facies - limestones, and dolomites with some hornfelsed shales. These are in fault contact with Ordivician limestones, argillites and shales. From this point in time forward things become increasingly complex due to extensive volcanism in possibly alternating terrestrial and lacustrine settings. None of the Cambrian or Precambrian rocks outcrop in the immediate Tonopah area but fragments of these lithologies are present in volcanic breccias locally, so it is believed they form the basement of the volcanic complex.
●Property Geology
The local geology is extremely well documented with geological investigations going back as early as 1905 when Spurr first published his voluminous observations of the camp. Spurr continued his work in the camp well into the 1920’s, followed by Bastin and Laney (1918), and later Nolan in 1930 published a study of the mines in the western part of the camp, and later expanded on this work, publishing a study that encompassed the entire camp in 1935. Later work was done in the area by Bonham (1970) and Bonham & Garside (1974 & 1979) during the time that work was carried out by Summa, Tenneco, and Houston Oil and Minerals. The earlier workers in the area had the distinct advantage of having the bulk of the mine workings available at one time or another for inspection, while the later workers had the ability to draw from all the earlier well-documented work.
Given the nature of this primarily felsic volcanic center, and the considerable alteration that has taken place prior, during and possibly somewhat after the mineralizing events, the geology of the camp is quite complex, and deciphering the history of the geology and mineralization of the area is only possible due to the thorough the attention paid to detail and the recording of these findings by earlier workers.
●Mineralization
The “Early” andesite of the Mizpah formation is almost exclusively the host rock for mineralization, however Bonanza style lode mineralization of the epoch does extend into the later andesite and in certain mines above the Mizpah into the Extension Breccia, the West End Rhyolitic intrusive and into the Fraction Tuff. From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff.
At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.
It is easy to see the vein they were following, a rich vein with lots of gem-quality quartz in a thick, wide vein running from the surface down. A shaft was cut 62 feet deep at about a 20-degree angle, and at the bottom, it branches into a horizontal adit running North to North East under the peak of this hill right next to the General Thomas Hill (where one of the largest producing mines in the area is still located). There is some really good color even at the top of the shaft, so easy to get to. There is plenty of material in the access point before you even enter the mine. This is one of the last Tonopah mines available for mining.
●Previous Exploration Work
No significant exploration has been noted at these mines in a few decades so a historical account of publicly found data was assimilated. The Tonopah Mining District began circa 1900 with the discovery of gold and silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler when he went looking for a lost burro he owned. The burro had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping. When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at the beast, but instead noticed the rock was unusually heavy. He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history. While Butler may have been responsible for the first ore strike, it took men of wealth and power to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah.
George Wingfield, a 24-year old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons. Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and to file for a gaming license. In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah, which spurred a boycott in China of U.S. goods. By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million. When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank. They grub staked miners with friend Nick Abelman, bought existing mines, and by the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, , Nixon and Wingfield were worth over $30 million. Small mining ventures continue to this day to provide income for local miners.
The discovery and development of the Tonopah area can be separated into four periods. From 1900 to 1903 the various participants acquired their ground and commenced development work by sinking shafts to access the ore. Between 1903 and 1907 development continued and better and more efficient equipment was deployed to increase production. The recession of 1907 to 1910 caused production to drop off as only the higher-grade ore could be profitably mined with silver prices dropping to as low as $0.25/oz. During this period many of the weaker companies went out of business and consolidation of claims occurred. The high point of the Tonopah camp occurred between 1910 and 1930 with production peaking around 1918 at 622,364 tons/year, with a recorded value of $9,311,560, and declining steadily through the 1920’s.
Production came to a halt with the exception of leasehold mining in the 30’s due to the depression and low precious metals prices. There was virtually no activity during the war in the 40’s but there was somewhat of a resurgence of activity in the 50’s. In the Tonopah area produced in the order of 174 million ounces of silver, and 1.86 million ounces of gold from approximately 8.8 million tons of ore. Sporadic exploration has continued in the general area with new prospects being discovered including the Hall Molybdenum Mine, the Midway, Three Hills, and Hasbrouck gold prospects.
By January of 1901 there were between 40 and 50 lessees working leases granted by Butler et al, which consisted of 100 feet of vein and 50 feet to either side. It is problematic to determine exactly what production came from which claim or lease as typically several were amalgamated by a single company, and quite often the underground workings connected from one claim to the next. Often a shaft on one claim was used pretty much exclusively while a nearby shaft on the same groups of claims sat idle. It is likely impossible to ascertain or differentiate what production came from a single source or ascribe in many cases the full significance of some of these veins especially as quite often the production from one mine was brought to surface at another shaft, and not reported in a segregated manner.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for the property has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.

●Local Infrastructure
Nearby geological attractions include Lunar Crater, the Sump and Monte Cristo’s Castle and there are five wilderness areas within hours of the community. The nearby Tonopah Test Range is the town’s main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas over the last half dozen decades as a nuclear test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the Nighthawk. Its location about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway, the town has done fairly well. The Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming. Numerous restaurants, shops, gas stations and motels means it is a perfect place for staging while you work this mine.
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.

They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene. The early geology of the general Tonopah region is relatively simple with the earliest Cambrian and Precambrian rocks comprised primarily of distal maritime facies - limestones, and dolomites with some hornfelsed shales. These are in fault contact with Ordivician limestones, argillites and shales. From this point in time forward things become increasingly complex due to extensive volcanism in possibly alternating terrestrial and lacustrine settings. None of the Cambrian or Precambrian rocks outcrop in the immediate Tonopah area but fragments of these lithologies are present in volcanic breccias locally, so it is believed they form the basement of the volcanic complex.
●Property Geology
The local geology is extremely well documented with geological investigations going back as early as 1905 when Spurr first published his voluminous observations of the camp. Spurr continued his work in the camp well into the 1920’s, followed by Bastin and Laney (1918), and later Nolan in 1930 published a study of the mines in the western part of the camp, and later expanded on this work, publishing a study that encompassed the entire camp in 1935. Later work was done in the area by Bonham (1970) and Bonham & Garside (1974 & 1979) during the time that work was carried out by Summa, Tenneco, and Houston Oil and Minerals. The earlier workers in the area had the distinct advantage of having the bulk of the mine workings available at one time or another for inspection, while the later workers had the ability to draw from all the earlier well-documented work.
Given the nature of this primarily felsic volcanic center, and the considerable alteration that has taken place prior, during and possibly somewhat after the mineralizing events, the geology of the camp is quite complex, and deciphering the history of the geology and mineralization of the area is only possible due to the thorough the attention paid to detail and the recording of these findings by earlier workers.
●Mineralization
The “Early” andesite of the Mizpah formation is almost exclusively the host rock for mineralization, however Bonanza style lode mineralization of the epoch does extend into the later andesite and in certain mines above the Mizpah into the Extension Breccia, the West End Rhyolitic intrusive and into the Fraction Tuff. From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff.
At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.
●Previous Exploration Work
No significant exploration completed prior to our exploration phase.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.
●XRF Survey
The analysis of the XRF measurements of Fortuna & Eclipse Mines showed that the elements promising for economic benefiting are: Gold, Titanium, Manganese, Iron, Arsenic, Rubidium, Strontium, Zirconium, Niobium, Hafnium, Tungsten, and Bismuth. These mines are adjacent to one another and were combined during mapping and analysis. The terrain was extreme and difficult to traverse. Limited samples were taken on slopes greater than 30% due to safety concerns. All visible pits, shafts and ridges were sampled, refer to Ni 43-101 Technical Report for further details. Due to limited samples many of the values were extrapolated from inputs into mapping software and thus should be considered when reviewing.

●Local Infrastructure
Nearby geological attractions include Lunar Crater, the Sump and Monte Cristo’s Castle and there are five wilderness areas within hours of the community. The nearby Tonopah Test Range is the town’s main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas over the last half dozen decades as a nuclear test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the Nighthawk. Its location about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway, the town has done fairly well. The Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming. Numerous restaurants, shops, gas stations and motels means it is a perfect place for staging while you work this mine.
Infrastructure is excellent in Tonopah district. Power is available at various points throughout the prospect, with a high-tension line running east-west along the northern margin of the Belmont tailings. Most supplies are available in Tonopah, while the nearest railhead is in Mina Nevada, approximately 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northwest along highway 95. Manpower is available in the region, and personnel exist locally with training specific to the mining industry due to the proximity of the property to Kinross’s Round Mountain, and Scorpio Gold’s Mineral Peak operations. The owned claims all have cell phone service. Las Vegas is located approximately 280 kilometers (174 miles) to the southeast of the property, while Reno (which is an important mining supply center) is 270 kilometers (168 miles) to the northwest. The claim block area should be large enough to accommodate a production facility, and there are several potential processing plant sites in the area.
●Property Infrastructure
There is no developed infrastructure on this property.
Mine 7 - Fortuna
Pursuant to the Purchase and Merger Agreement of September 17, 2019, the Company acquired an undivided one hundred percent (100%) interest and deed in and to certain mineral interests found in the Fortuna Mine Property located in Tonopah, Nevada in Esmeralda County.
● The Indicated/Unproven/Estimated Gross gold resources are 2,657,630.86 oz based on projected 200 feet excavation. This estimate includes the Eclipse mine claim. Due to the topography less, samples were taken at these two adjacent claims which leads to greater uncertainty in reserve numbers.
●Property Description and Ownership
The Fortuna mine is lode and open-pit mines. As defined by the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, deposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries. They also include other rock in- place bearing valuable minerals and may be broad zones of mineralized rock. Examples include quartz or other veins bearing gold or other metallic minerals and large volume, but low-grade disseminated gold deposits. Descriptions are by metes and bounds surveys beginning at the discovery point on the claim and including a reference to natural objects or permanent monuments. Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1500 feet in length, and a maximum width of 600 feet (300 feet on either side of the vein).
The general course of this claim is North and South, and it is situated in the NW Quarter of Section 11, Township 1N, Range 40E, Mount Diablo Meridian, Esmeralda County, Nevada. This claim is 600 feet wide and 1,500 feet high.

●Location and Access
The property is almost entirely within the boundaries of the municipality of Tonopah Nevada. The property is readily accessible via Highway 95 from Las Vegas to the South or Hwy’s 95/6 from the North/West from Northern Nevada/Reno or Bishop California, and from Highway 6 from the east which intersects highway 95 in the heart of Tonopah. This mine can be accessed by dirt roads using an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) or four-wheel drive vehicle and a GPS, main dirt roads leading through the mining district are maintained, but two track roads to the individual mines are often difficult to traverse. Caution is mandatory within the entire valley as it is dotted with abandoned mines - some of them are easy to see from a distance, and other are impossible to see until you are right on top of them. 20% of them are roped or fenced off - the rest do not have safety barriers and one should be extremely careful in entering them. Being situated in the high desert there are limited water sources in the area throughout 10 months out of the year.
●Regional Geology
Tonopah is located slightly inboard of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and on the eastern margin of the “Walker Lane”, a zone of Miocene structural deformation trending northwest to southeast parallel to the trend of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Eastern California. The Walker Lane can best be characterized as a broad zone of abundant strike-slip right-stepping faulting. The trend of the pre-Tertiary geologic units over much of the Walker Lane exhibits an arcuate pattern as a result of the influence of two major structural regimes. A series of these arcs have been identified by past workers with the Tonopah area having been identified as being within the Silver Peak-Palmetto- Montezuma Oroflex (Albers & Stewart 1972). The oroflex is described as southward convex with bedding, fold axes and faults trending to the northwest in the Silver Peak Range, trending east-west in the Palmetto Mountains and swinging around to the Northeast in the Montezuma Peak region. The Tonopah area lies on the eastern limb of the oroflex. The Walker Lane is also noted as being particularly well endowed with mineral deposits and the coincidence of these two structural regimes has created favorable plumbing, which is responsible for the high frequency of deposits in the region.
To the west of Tonopah, the White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada Range and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone, with up to 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and dip up to 25° to the east, tilting occurred in the middle Miocene. The early geology of the general Tonopah region is relatively simple with the earliest Cambrian and Precambrian rocks comprised primarily of distal maritime facies - limestones, and dolomites with some hornfelsed shales. These are in fault contact with Ordivician limestones, argillites and shales. From this point in time forward things become increasingly complex due to extensive volcanism in possibly alternating terrestrial and lacustrine settings. None of the Cambrian or Precambrian rocks outcrop in the immediate Tonopah area but fragments of these lithologies are present in volcanic breccias locally, so it is believed they form the basement of the volcanic complex.
●Property Geology
The local geology is extremely well documented with geological investigations going back as early as 1905 when Spurr first published his voluminous observations of the camp. Spurr continued his work in the camp well into the 1920’s, followed by Bastin and Laney (1918), and later Nolan in 1930 published a study of the mines in the western part of the camp, and later expanded on this work, publishing a study that encompassed the entire camp in 1935. Later work was done in the area by Bonham (1970) and Bonham & Garside (1974 & 1979) during the time that work was carried out by Summa, Tenneco, and Houston Oil and Minerals. The earlier workers in the area had the distinct advantage of having the bulk of the mine workings available at one time or another for inspection, while the later workers had the ability to draw from all the earlier well-documented work.
Given the nature of this primarily felsic volcanic center, and the considerable alteration that has taken place prior, during and possibly somewhat after the mineralizing events, the geology of the camp is quite complex, and deciphering the history of the geology and mineralization of the area is only possible due to the thorough the attention paid to detail and the recording of these findings by earlier workers.
●Mineralization

From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present.
The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff.
At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits.
These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present.

●Location and Access
The Black Hawk mining district is mostly in sections. 20, 21, 22, 28, and 29, T. 18 S., R. 16 W., in Grant County, N. Mex., and is 21 miles by road west of Silver City, the terminus of a branch line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Access roads are plentiful being situated in Gila National Forest with thousands of miles of off-road vehicle trails. A four-wheel drive, high ground clearance vehicle with good tires is highly recommended due to large rock obstacles and deep sandy washes that must be traversed to access the mines.
The 12’ tall and 15’ wide entrance of Purple Heart mine is partially blocked by a tree and some brush but is still easy to access on foot. The mine shaft is visible for 70-feet before water prohibits the full exploration of the shaft(s). Local ranchers have used this water for decades to fill cattle troughs, so it is likely replenished every year during the wet season. The adit will not be entirely explored without dewatering the mine. Evidence of old tracking and tailings onsite indicated that the workings on this main adit will likely be extensive.
●Regional Geology
The oldest rocks in the Black Hawk mining district belong to the Proterozoic Bullard Peak Group, which includes quartzite, amphibolite, migmatite and various types of schist and gneiss (Hewitt, 1959; Gillerman, 1964). Intruding these rocks is Proterozoic quartz diorite gneiss, which is the predominant rock in the area and part of the Burro Mountain batholith that crops out extensively to the south and southwest of the area (Gillerman, 1964). The gneiss, which contains 35 ppm Co and 23 ppm Ni (Gerwe and Norman, 1985), is in turn intruded by Tertiary Twin Peaks monzonite porphyry and other rock types.
The Twin Peaks monzonite stock also occurs as dikes and irregular masses in the northern portion of the district (Gillerman, 1964). This monzonite contains approximately 20 ppm Co and 11 ppm Ni (Gerwe and Norman, 1985), is Late Cretaceous age (72.5 +- 4.7 Ma; Hedlund, 1985a), and is associated with the mineralized veins. A whole-rock sample of altered material adjacent to a vein has an age date of 65.3 +- 1.2 Ma (K-Ar; Gerwe, 1986). Metamorphic and igneous rocks are overlain by Cretaceous quartzite and Tertiary rhyolite in the northern area of the district (Gillerman, 1964).
Two prominent fault systems trending slightly east of north are the main geologic structures in the district (Gillerman, 1964). Each fault system consists of a rather persistent fault from which other faults split off, trending to the northeast or northwest.

●Mineralization
The unusual nickel-cobalt-silver deposits of the Black Hawk mining district make the area one of special interest. Although similar deposits are described worldwide (Cobalt and Great Bear Lake in Canada and Joachimstah in the former Czechoslovakia (Gillerman and Whitebread, 1956), few known deposits have nickel- cobalt-silver ore with uraniumin carbonate gangue (Gillerman, 1964). In the Black Hawk district, the mineral deposits are simple fissure-filling veins mostly in the quartz diorite gneiss near bodies of monzonite porphyry.
Four mineral assemblages occur: 1) silver-argentite-uraninite-niccolite-te-rannneisberg. 2) silver- rammeisbergite-gersdorffite-nickel skutterudite. 3) chalcopyrite-tennantite-galena-sphalerite. And 4) acanthite-jalpaite-pearceite-covellite (Von Bargen, 1979, 1993). Pitchblend is found with minor pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite.
Other minerals occurring in these deposits are millerite, erythrite, annabergite, barite, manganocalcite, and various nickel and cobalt sulfarsenides and arsenides (Gillerman, 1964; Von Bargen, 1979, 1993). Deposits are most plentiful in a 1-mi-wide by as much as 3-mi-long area on the southwest side of Twin Peak stock (Gillerman, 1964). The veins can be traced for more than 1,000 ft and have reached as much as 600 ft vertically. They vary in width from 1 to 3 ft but may open to as much as 10 ft wide where they cut quartz diorite gneiss.
The veins are inconspicuous in outcrop and are recognized by brown-stained, carbonate filling (Gillerman, 1964). The carbonates, largely calcite, dolomite, siderite and ankerite, are the most common vein minerals. Quartz is rare, occurring as a dull yellow-green chert or chalcedony. A dump sampled assayed 0.005 % U308, 0.08% Cu, 0.05% Pb, 0.06% Zn, and 0.0052% Ni (McLemore, 1983, #3745). Mineralization occurred about 65.3 +/-1.2 Ma ago and at temperatures of 29O deg - 41O deg C (Gewe, 1986). Low salinities of fluid inclusions (<2 eq. wt.% NaCl) suggest that the water in the system was meteoric (Gewe, 1986; Gewe and Norman, 1985).
Larmide veins consist of native gold and native silver, with silver occurring in the central part of the vein and nickel-and cobalt-bearing minerals, mostly nickel skutterudite, are on the vein margins (Gillerman, 1968). Uraninite is found mostly in the outermost zones associated with nickel-and cobalt- bearing minerals, not with silver. The carbonate vein-minerals form in a sequence where the carbonate species calcite, dolomite, ankerite and siderite replace one another due to increased carbon dioxide in the mineralizing solutions at a constant temperature (Naumov et al., 1971).
●Previous Exploration Work
The Purple Heart Mine is one of the original mines in the district, and records show that it has changed hands and been worked on several occasions since the turn of the century. The main workings consist of a massive adit cut on a gentle 20-degree downward slope. The entrance is huge - about 12’ feet tall and 15’ wide. You could drive a truck in there.
At 70-feet in the mine is full of water - local ranchers have used this water for decades to feed cattle troughs, so it is likely replenished every year during the wet season. The Black Hawk or Bullard Peak mining districts in the northern Burro Mountains, is approximate 21 miles west of Silver City, NM. The district includes all of the mines and prospect pits within five miles to the east and south of Bullard Peak. Mining began in the district in 1881 with the discovery of the unique gold-silver-nickel-cobalt deposit at the Alhambra mine (Gilleman and Whitebread, 1956).
Subsequent prospecting soon discovered additional deposits. Mining continued until 1893, when a decline in silver price and depletion of rich silver ore caused the mines to close. During 1917, the Black Hawk mine was dewatered, but recorded production numbers varied by report. In 1920, pitchblende (uraninite) was recognized in the mine dumps of the area, and in 1949 the area became of interest as a possible source of uranium, gold, silver, nickel, and cobalt.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.

●Local Infrastructure
There are no close-by power lines, gas lines, or settlements occur near the Purple Heart property.
The Black Hawk or Bullard Peak mining districts in the northern Burro Mountains is approximate 34 kilometers (21 miles) West of Silver City, NM. The district includes all of the mines and prospect pits within five miles to the east and south of Bullard Peak. Infrastructure is great due to proximity to Silver City which is a railhead and former mining town itself. The population of Silver City is adequate to provide a skilled work force. Electricity is available, but it is likely that additional electrical capacity would need to be added to accommodate modern mining activities.
●Property Infrastructure
There is no developed infrastructure on this property.

●Location and Access
The Black Hawk mining district is mostly in sections. 20, 21, 22, 28, and 29, T. 18 S., R. 16 W., in Grant County, N. Mex., and is 21 miles by road west of Silver City, the terminus of a branch line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Access roads are plentiful being situated in Gila National Forest with thousands of miles of off-road vehicle trails. A four-wheel drive, high ground clearance vehicle with good tires is highly recommended due to large rock obstacles and deep sandy washes that must be traversed to access the mines.
Blackmoor Mine lies almost at the end of the road before you get to the Gila River, and extensive excavations include a large 2-acre leveled staging area for equipment within a few hundred feet of the mine. The roads are in fairly good shape to access the mine, but there are a few spots that are fairly steep and narrow, so good clearance and good tire tread is recommended.
●Regional Geology
The Black Hawk or Bullard Peak mining districts in the northern Burro Mountains, is approximate 21 miles west of Silver City, NM. The district includes all of the mines and prospect pits within five miles to the east and south of Bullard Peak.

During 1917, the Black Hawk mine was dewatered, but recorded production numbers varied by report.
In 1920, pitchblende (uraninite) was recognized in the mine dumps of the area, and in 1949 the area became of interest as a possible source of uranium, gold, silver, nickel, and cobalt. Types of deposits found in the Black Hawk mining district include Laramide veins, tungsten placer deposits, and pegmatites. Total metal production from 1881-1960 is estimated as 3,000 lbs Cu, 1,000 oz Au, 1,286,000 oz Ag, and 4,000 lbs Pb. In addition, 10,542 short tons of (2.7-71 % WO,) tungsten ore (Richter and Lawrence, 1983; Dale and McJGnney, 1959) and 615 short tons of fluorspar ore have been produced (Williams, 1966; McAnulty, 1978).
The oldest rocks in the Black Hawk mining district belong to the Proterozoic Bullard Peak Group, which includes quartzite, amphibolite, migmatite and various types of schist and gneiss (Hewitt, 1959; Gillerman, 1964). Intruding these rocks is Proterozoic quartz diorite gneiss, which is the predominant rock in the area and part of the Burro Mountain batholith that crops out extensively to the south and southwest of the area (Gillerman, 1964). The gneiss, which contains 35 ppm Co and 23 ppm Ni (Gerwe and Norman, 1985), is in turn intruded by Tertiary Twin Peaks monzonite porphyry and other rock types.
The Twin Peaks monzonite stock also occurs as dikes and irregular masses in the northern portion of the district (Gillerman, 1964). This monzonite contains approximately 20 ppm Co and 11 ppm Ni (Gerwe and Norman, 1985), is Late Cretaceous age (72.5 +- 4.7 Ma; Hedlund, 1985a), and is associated with the mineralized veins. A whole-rock sample of altered material adjacent to a vein has an age date of 65.3 +- 1.2 Ma (K-Ar; Gerwe, 1986). Metamorphic and igneous rocks are overlain by Cretaceous quartzite and Tertiary rhyolite in the northern area of the district (Gillerman, 1964).
Two prominent fault systems trending slightly east of north are the main geologic structures in the district (Gillerman, 1964). Each fault system consists of a rather persistent fault from which other faults split off, trending to the northeast or northwest.
●Property Geology
The main mine consists of a large shaft cut to a depth of 25 feet with two horizontal adits/workings consisting of more than 2,800 feet in length heading northeast and southwest at the 25- foot level. Both adit entrances are largely blocked by natural erosion but would take more than a few hours of work to reopen and explore. There are extensive tailings onsite as well as a large wash that runs past the base of the tailings, which we would also recommending working. The old head frame and a reported cabin are long gone, but the mine is cut only a few feet from the road, so you will be able to work this one fairly easily.
●Mineralization
The unusual nickel-cobalt-silver deposits of the Black Hawk mining district make the area one of special interest. Although similar deposits are described worldwide (Cobalt and Great Bear Lake in Canada and Joachimstah in the former Czechoslovakia (Gillerman and Whitebread, 1956), few known deposits have nickel- cobalt-silver ore with uraniumin carbonate gangue (Gillerman, 1964). In the Black Hawk district, the mineral deposits are simple fissure-filling veins mostly in the quartz diorite gneiss near bodies of monzonite porphyry.
Four mineral assemblages occur: 1) silver-argentite-uraninite-niccolite-te-rannneisberg. 2) silver- rammeisbergite-gersdorffite-nickel skutterudite. 3) chalcopyrite-tennantite-galena-sphalerite. And 4) acanthite-jalpaite-pearceite-covellite (Von Bargen, 1979, 1993). Pitchblend is found with minor pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite.
Other minerals occurring in these deposits are millerite, erythrite, annabergite, barite, manganocalcite, and various nickel and cobalt sulfarsenides and arsenides (Gillerman, 1964; Von Bargen, 1979, 1993). Deposits are most plentiful in a 1-mi-wide by as much as 3-mi-long area on the southwest side of Twin Peak stock (Gillerman, 1964). The veins can be traced for more than 1,000 ft and have reached as much as 600 ft vertically. They vary in width from 1 to 3 ft but may open to as much as 10 ft wide where they cut quartz diorite gneiss. The veins are inconspicuous in outcrop and are recognized by brown-stained, carbonate filling (Gillerman, 1964). The carbonates, largely calcite, dolomite, siderite and ankerite, are the most common vein minerals. Quartz is rare, occurring as a dull yellow-green chert or chalcedony.

Mineralization occurred about 65.3 +/-1.2 Ma ago and at temperatures of 29O deg - 41O deg C (Gewe, 1986). Low salinities of fluid inclusions (<2 eq. wt.% NaCl) suggest that the water in the system was meteoric (Gewe, 1986; Gewe and Norman, 1985).
Larmide veins consist of native gold and native silver, with silver occurring in the central part of the vein and nickel-and cobalt-bearing minerals, mostly nickel skutterudite, are on the vein margins (Gillerman, 1968). Uraninite is found mostly in the outermost zones associated with nickel-and cobalt- bearing minerals, not with silver. The carbonate vein-minerals form in a sequence where the carbonate species calcite, dolomite, ankerite and siderite replace one another due to increased carbon dioxide in the mineralizing solutions at a constant temperature (Naumov et al., 1971).
●Previous Exploration Work
The Blackmoor Mine is one of the original mines in the Black Hawk District. Reportedly one of the larger producers of gold, silver, nickel and cobalt, more than 25,000 tons of ore have been attributed to this large operation.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.

● The Indicated/Unproven/Estimated Gross gold resources are 1,195,828.49 oz based on projected 200 feet excavation.
●Property Description and Ownership
Our New River Mine is located in La Paz County, Arizona. This mine is a lode mine as well as an open-pit mine. As defined by the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, deposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries. They also include other rock in- place bearing valuable minerals and may be broad zones of mineralized rock. Examples include quartz or other veins bearing gold or other metallic minerals and large volume, but low-grade disseminated gold deposits. Descriptions are by metes and bounds surveys beginning at the discovery point on the claim and including a reference to natural objects or permanent monuments. Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1500 feet in length, and a maximum width of 600 feet (300 feet on either side of the vein).
As defined by Anglo-American, open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, is a surface mining technique that extracts minerals from an open pit in the ground. Open-pit mining is the most common method used throughout the world for mineral mining and does not require extractive methods or tunnels. This surface mining technique is used when mineral or ore deposits are found relatively close to the surface of the earth. Open-pits are sometimes called ‘quarries’ when they produce building materials and dimension stone.
The general course of this claim is North and South and it is situated in the SE Quarter of Section 20, Township 7N, Range 16W, Gila Salt River Meridian, La Paz County, Arizona. This claim is 600 feet in width and 1,500 feet in length. This claim runs from the location monument on which this location notice is posted approximately 1,200 feet in a Northerly direction to the North end line and approximately 300 feet in a Southerly direction to the South end line. This claim is marked by four (4) monuments, one at each corner of the claim.

●Location and Access
The Northern Plomosa mineral district lies within the northern half of the Linskey Northeast 7-1/2-minute quadrangle (unpublished United States Geological Survey preliminary topographic map), at the north end of the Northern Plomosa Mountain Range in La Paz County, Arizona. The district is approximately 45 kilometers southeast of Parker, Arizona and immediately (5km) west of the small community of Bouse. New River mine can be reached from Yuma, 84 miles north on State Highway 95 to Quartzsite, continue 6 miles and take a right on Plomosa Rd for 20 miles to the city of Bouse. Continue to Rayder Ave Turn right and follow GPS to mine down off road trails.
●Regional Geology
The Northern Plomosa district is located within the Basin and Range Province of southwestern North America. The physiography and structural geology of this region was shaped largely by Cenozoic extension. Notable regional geologic features in western Arizona include large expanses of foliated high-grade metamorphic rocks of variable and commonly obscure protolith (Spencer and Reynolds, 1989b). The schists are commonly green in color owing to contained chlorite, and they typically have a gently dipping mylonitic fabric which is strongly and consistently lineated with a northeast trend. The metamorphic rocks are commonly bounded above by a low-angle detachment fault which is oriented grossly parallel to the foliation in the footwall metamorphic rocks, and which places relatively unmetamorphosed upper-plate rocks of various ages, in many cases Tertiary, in contact with the lower plate. The upper-plate rocks are commonly, but not invariably, broken up by numerous normal faults which merge into, or are truncated by the underlying detachment fault.
The result is a number of distinct tilt blocks which dip generally southwest into the detachment fault. The detachment fault itself is commonly underlain by a thin (<1 meter) microbreccia ledge. Mylonitic lineation indicates the direction of extension, and asymmetric mylonitic petrofabrics indicate that the sense of shear during mylonitization was top to the northeast in west-central Arizona (Spencer and Reynolds, 1989b). Mapping by Lucchitta and Suneson (1981) indicates that the upper plate rocks to the Buckskin-Rawhide detachment fault, exposed in southernmost Mohave County, Arizona, are in fact structurally continuous with the undisturbed rocks of the Colorado Plateau. This leads to the interpretation that the lower plate was in fact pulled out from under the upper plate during the southwest-directed extension. Minimum total displacements have been estimated at 55 km on the Buckskin-Rawhide fault (Spencer and Reynolds, 1989b), and 40 to 50 km on the correlative Bullard detachment fault (Reynolds and Spencer, 1985a).
Lower plate crystalline rocks though commonly overprinted by Tertiary mylonitization (Wright et al., 1986), represent pre-Tertiary rocks that were at deep crustal levels before extension. Upper plate rocks include crystalline rocks of Proterozoic age, remnants of deformed Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and early- to middle-Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Spencer and Reynolds, 1989a). High-angle block faulting has somewhat fragmented the older geologic picture, and late Tertiary and Quaternary volcanic and sedimentary cover further obscure it.
●Property Geology
Proterozoic crystalline rocks in the Bouse Hills are lithologically diverse; they consist primarily of the following: (1) unfoliated to weakly foliated granite or granodiorite, (2) metasedimentary rocks with steep, east-northeast striking lithologic layering and foliation, and (3) porphyritic biotite granite and leucocratic muscovite granite. The steep, east-northeast striking crystalloblastic foliation and compositional layering are characteristic of early Proterozoic rocks in Arizona and suggest that such rocks in the Bouse Hills are of similar age; Some of the granitoids, however, are not foliated and are probably younger.
The Proterozoic crystalline rocks are intruded by a biotite granodiorite that forms the eastern Bouse Hills. Numerous dikes intrude older crystalline rocks near the contact with the pluton. Some of these dikes are fine-grained granitoids that resemble the pluton whereas others have an aphanitic groundmass with phenocrysts of biotite, feldspar, and quartz. Dikes with an aphanitic groundmass commonly have chilled margins suggesting shallow levels of emplacement. Biotite from three widely spaced samples, two from the pluton and one from a dike adjacent to the pluton, yielded K-Ar dates of approximately 20 Ma which is interpreted as the age of the pluton.
Crystalline rocks in the western Bouse Hills are depositionally overlain by a sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that is now tilted moderately to steeply to the southwest. This sequence includes basal sandstone and conglomerate, volcanic flows and tuffs, sedimentary breccias that are products of catastrophic debris avalanches (e.g., Krieger, 1977), and limestone. These rocks record the beginning of volcanism and the development of fault scarps and sedimentary basins at about 24 to 22 Ma. The tilted sequence and underlying crystalline rocks are unconformably overlain by flat-lying to gently dipping, felsic, ash-flow tuffs and related flows and pyroclastic rocks. A K-Ar date indicates that these volcanic rocks are 20.5 Ma (Eberly and Stanley, 1978), which is about the same age as the nearby granitoid pluton in the eastern Bouse Hills. It is possible that the felsic volcanic rocks are eruptive equivalents of the eastern Bouse Hills pluton and that the two rock types were derived from the same magma. Mafic volcanic flows (possibly entirely basalt) overlie the felsic volcanic rocks and are only slightly younger (19.5 Ma).
●Mineralization
Mineral deposits in the Bouse Hills can be divided into three groups: (1) amorphous fracture- and open-space-filling manganese oxides, commonly with coarse brown calcite, hosted by fractured or brecciated Miocene volcanic rocks, (2) barite veins with minor fluorite hosted by Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and (3) brittle shear zones within crystalline rocks that contain chrysocolla and hematite.
Approximately a million pounds of manganese were mined from the nearby mine (Black Bird mine) during a brief period (1952-1954; Keith et al, 1983). The majority of manganese deposits in the Bouse Hills are hosted by sheared and locally brecciated rocks along fault zones. A shear zone passes through the western part of Bouse Hills and was clearly a major controlling factor in manganese mineralization. Most of the manganese ore was deposited within a sedimentary breccia of basalt clasts that locally contains sandstone lenses. Manganese mineralization occurred in association with aqueous fluid movement along generally northwest-trending shear zones in the Bouse Hills. Calcite is commonly associated with the manganese deposits. Slickenside striations on manganiferous rocks indicate that some fault movement occurred after mineralization.
Approximately 2500 tons of barite were mined from the Bouse Hills in 1948 (Stewart and Pfister, 1960). Most of the barite deposits are veins up to 2 m thick. The barite deposits are hosted in Tertiary sedimentary breccia formed by a catastrophic debris avalanche and consists largely of irregular open-space fillings. Minor fluorite is commonly associated with barite. Deposits of fracture- and open-space-filling chrysocolla + hematite± malachite + quartz are present along two brittle shear zones within crystalline rocks in the central Bouse Hills. These small deposits resemble some of the detachment-fault-related deposits in the nearby Buckskin Mountains (Spencer and Welty, 1989).
The three types of mineral deposit in the Bouse Hills are mineralogically distinct and are not obviously related to each other. Fluid-inclusion data reveal differences in fluids responsible for barite and manganese mineralization. The barite veins and manganese deposits are hosted in Miocene volcanic rocks and are therefore Tertiary in age, although the manganese deposits are hosted by some of the youngest recognized volcanic rocks and may be several million years younger than the barite deposits. The structural and mineralogic similarity of the shear-zone hosted chrysocolla-hematite deposits to deposits related to detachment faults in the nearby Plomosa and Buckskin Mountains suggests that these deposits were derived from basin brines (Duncan, 1990).
The primary ore minerals are native gold, chrysocolla, and malachite. Gangue minerals include specular and earthy hematite, quartz, barite, fluorite, calcite and manganese oxides. Although open-space filling textures are locally abundant, most of the economic mineralization occurs as fault-controlled replacements in calcareous sediments.
Mineralization is very varied and consists of the following:
1.Major gold placer deposits in washes from erosion of numerous quartz veins and veinlets in metamorphic rocks;
2.Spotty, partly oxidized copper and gold mineralization with minor lead and zinc, and with quartz, and iron and manganese oxides in irregular fault and fracture veins in metamorphosed Mesozoic sediments, probably Cretaceous shale, sandstone, conglomerate, and limestone; Precambrian metamorphics, and Cretaceous or Tertiary volcanics, with intrusions of Laramide diorite and granite;
3.Manganese oxides in irregular, lenticular bodies and veinlets with variable amounts of iron oxides, calcite, barite, gypsum, and traces of beryllium along fracture and breccia zones in Cretaceous or Tertiary andesitic volcanics;
4.Barite and fluorite in veins along faults and fractures in Cretaceous or Tertiary volcanic flows and agglomerates;
5.Spotty pods and stringers of copper, lead, and zinc minerals with silver and minor gold, and with associated iron and manganese, in faulted Paleozoic limestone blocks and in irregular veins in Cretaceous or tertiary andesite volcanics cut by Laramide quartz monzonite intrusives;
6.Gold and silver ores in irregular veins along fractures and fault zones associated with quartz stringers and Laramide diorite and granite porphyry dikes in Mesozoic schist;
7.Sporadic scheelite in quartz veinlets in carcareous Mesozoic schist close to Laramide granitic intrusives;
8.Irregular, impure iron oxides, usually associated with manganese, in contact metamorphic deposits in Paleozoic limestone beds close to intrusives;
9.Bentonite clay in probable lakebed sediments; and
10.Minor chrysoprase in stringers in rhyolite. Some chrysoprase has been mined and sold for gem material.
●Previous Exploration Work
Howland Bancroft (1911) published the first descriptions of the mines, prospects, and geology of the Northern Plomosa district following a visit to the area in 1909. At the time of his visit the district was being actively prospected and had apparently been so since the latter part of the 19th century. Two mines, the Little Butte and the Blue Slate, were in operation.
The target of the prospecting and mining was a hematitic breccia found within high-angle structures and carrying good values in copper and gold, plus minor silver. Production in 1909 from the Little Butte mine totaled 22 carloads (approximately 900.metric tons) at a reported grade of 7.6%Cu, $6.65/ton in gold and 2.4 oz./ton silver (Bancroft, 1911). Since the reconnaissance report of Bancroft (1911), only one specific and detailed study of the economic geology of the Northern Plomosa district has been made available to the public. J.P. Jemmett (1966) completed a doctoral dissertation in which he mapped the geology of the Linskey Northeast 7-1/2-minute quadrangle and assessed the economic potential of the area. Scarborough and Meader mapped the Northern Plomosa Mountains in 1981 (Scarborough and Meader, 1989) and produced an open file report on their work for the Arizona Bureau of Geology and Mineral Technology (Scarborough and Meader, 1983).
The only relatively modem mining activity of commercial scale in the district was an attempt by the Loma Grande Mining Company to recover gold values from low grade ore mined by an open pit near the old Little Butte Mine. The cyanide leaching operation failed in 1960 (Jemmett, 1966). Relics of this operation, including large steel cyanidation vats, are still in evidence. At the time of Jemmett’s study the Dutchman mine was being worked at a very small scale for free gold which was sold as specimens (Jemmett, 1966). Total production from the district then, had been estimated by Keith et al. (1983) at 346,000 lbs. Cu,; 5,000 oz. Au; 25,000 lbs. Pb; and 7,000 oz. Ag from approximately 7,500 tons of ore.
●Exploration Plans
Recent exploration phase for these properties has been completed.
●Sampling and Analysis
Twenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing. Where available, rock samples were analyzed by XRF on a clean surface exposure created by chipping the surface with a rock hammer. Quaternary alluvium was analyzed by XRF when rock samples were not available. Holes were dug 6-8 inches below the surface and then the grains were pulverized using the flat end of rock hammer that was cleaned using disposable cleaning pads between each sample.
Samples were analyzed using a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF, Serial #55948 that was calibrated by Thermo Scientific on 4/5/2019. The Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrument was used in mining mode to analyze 23 minerals with GOLDD Technology enabled. GOLDD Technology: When low detection limits and high sample throughput are critical, the Niton XL3t GOLDD+ XRF analyzer delivers measurement times up to 10-times faster than conventional Si-PIN detectors and up to 3-times more precise than conventional smaller silicon drift detectors (SDD) - without helium purge or vacuum. Niton analyzers also feature the highest performance X-ray tube and speed detector available on the market. Spectrographs were created for each sample and are included in Appendix C.
Data came from two separate programs and were manually merged into a database using Microsoft Excel. The data was then scrutinized to remove any obvious errors, whether it was sample exposure time, or erroneous readings. This data was then manually brought into mapping software and double verified data to ensure there were no errors while migrating data. With approximately 100 ft grid spacing between sample points it was determined that mapping using least squares algorithm produced the best fit maps for the collected data. Grid flexing was enabled to model data beyond the data points to extend past the mine; although this adds some ambiguity to the edge data it produced much cleaner maps. All data points were created using GIS data collected from the Garmin E-trex 30x coupled with ppm reading recorded from the Niton GOLDD XRF. Surface outcrops were also mapped by hand to help understand subsurface geology. The output maps with their full analysis are shown in the following section.
