Reserves
The Company's net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (referred to herein collectively as "oil") and its net proved reserves of gas have been estimated by the Company's engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reserve estimates, except for the reserves purchased from Amoco, at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, have been audited by independent petroleum consultants, H. J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. The December 31, 1997, reserves associated with the Wyoming properties acquired from Amoco were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants, Ryder Scott & Associates. The estimates for the prior years were reviewed by L. A. Martin & Associates, Inc. These estimates were used in the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization included in the Company's consolidated financial statements and for other reporting purposes. Except for the Consent Statement filed on September 2, 1997 concerning the Voyager acquisition, the Company has not filed any estimates of reserves with any federal authority or agency during the past year other than reserve estimates associated with the Voyager acquisition and estimates contained in its last annual report on Form 10-K. Set forth are estimates of the Company's net proved oil and gas reserves, all located in the United States.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. The accompanying table presents a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the production of the Company's estimated proved oil and gas reserves at the end of 1997 and 1996. The method of calculating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is as follows:
(1) Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas to the Company's year-end quantities of proved oil and gas reserves. Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.
(2) Future development and production costs are estimates of expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at year-end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
(3) Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to future pretax net cash flows. Future income tax expenses reflect the permanent differences, tax credits and allowances related to the Company's oil and gas producing activities included in the Company's consolidated income tax expense.
(4) The discount, calculated at ten percent per year, reflects an estimate of the timing of future net cash flows to give effect to the time value of money.

The Company's oil and gas exploration and production activities are conducted entirely within the United States by HPC and are concentrated in Wyoming and along the Gulf Coast, both onshore and offshore. At December 31, 1997, the Company's estimated proved reserves were 42.2 million barrels of oil and plant liquids and 83.6 billion cubic feet of gas. Of such reserves, approximately 34.2 million barrels of oil and plant liquids and 25.9 billion cubic feet of gas are associated with producing properties located primarily in Wyoming, which were acquired on December 18, 1997, (but effective as of December 1, 1997) for $115.4 million from Amoco. The Acquisition created a new core area for the Company and included the Salt Creek, Elk Basin and Grass Creek fields discussed below. Following the Acquisition, the Company's major producing properties include Salt Creek, Elk Basin, North Frisco City, Main Pass 64, Grass Creek and LaBarge fields. These six major fields represent 41.7 MMBOE, or 74% of the Company's total proved reserves. In addition, the Company owns fee mineral interest in 876,367 net acres in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Substantially all of the Company's oil and natural gas production is sold on the spot market or pursuant to contracts priced according to the spot market.
Description of Significant Properties
Salt Creek. The Company owns and operates the Salt Creek Field in the Powder River Basin in Natrona County, Wyoming. The Company's working interest varies from 65% to 100% in this multi-pay field. The field underwent primary development beginning in 1908. In the 1960's a waterflood was installed in the "Light Oil Unit" ("LOU") which is unitized from the surface to the base of the Sundance 3 formation. There are currently 666 producing wells and 598 injection wells located in the LOU on a flood pattern of approximately five acre well spacing. As of December 31, 1997, the field was producing a net of approximately 3,325 barrels per day of sweet crude oil.
The most prolific producing formation in the LOU is the Wall Creek 2 at a depth of 1,500 feet. It has produced approximately 385 million barrels of oil from an original estimated 950 million barrels of oil in place. In addition, the field has produced another 268 million barrels of oil from multiple horizons varying in depth down to 4,000 feet. The Company believes that the potential application of horizontal drilling to target unswept intervals within several of the reservoirs may have significant production and reserve potential. Horizontal drilling is one of the advanced technologies the Company plans to implement. Evidence of successful horizontal wells in several of these formations exists in immediately offsetting fields.
In addition, the potential for enhanced oil recovery through CO2 flooding is under consideration for the Wall Creek 2 formation. The Company owns an interest in LaBarge, which currently transports CO2 to an enhanced oil recovery project located approximately 90 miles from the Salt Creek Field.
Elk Basin. The Company owns and operates the Elk Basin field, located in the Bighorn Basin in Park County, Wyoming and Carbon County, Montana. The productive horizons range in depth from 1,700 feet to 6,000 feet, with the majority of the production coming from the Embar-Tensleep and the Madison formations. As of December 31, 1997, the field was producing a net of 1,538 barrels per day of oil from 215 producing wells.
The Embar-Tensleep reservoir was an inert gas injection pressure maintenance project until injection into the gas cap was discontinued in the 1970's. The Company is investigating the potential to re-establish the inert gas injection to increase reservoir pressure, which could have a significant impact on production rates. In addition, the Company plans to supplement this gas cap injection with horizontal producing wells located in the oil rim on the edge of the structure, which could improve the sweep efficiency and ultimate recovery. The shallow Frontier formation, at a depth of 1,700 feet, holds a significant number of potential low cost drilling opportunities to extend the production in this field down structure to the lowest known oil-water contact. Since 1986, 32 Frontier wells have been successfully drilled or recompleted within the Frontier Unit. These wells cost approximately $75,000 each, typically produce at rates of 20 barrels per day of oil and have cumulative recoveries up to 60 thousand barrels each. The Company has identified numerous potential drilling locations within the unit and outside the unit on Company leasehold.
Main Pass Block 64. Main Pass is located in federal waters offshore Louisiana about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans. The Company, as operator, discovered oil and gas upon drilling a test well in 1982. In 1989, the Company unitized portions of Main Pass blocks 64 and 65, covering the main pay sand (the "7,300' Sand Unit") and implemented a waterflood project to repressure the 7,300' Sand Unit. Through exploitation, additional acquisitions and field unitization, the Company currently has a working interest which averages approximately 80% in 24 gross wells, including five injection wells. Gross cumulative production from the 7,300' Sand Unit over almost 15 years has totaled 11.1 million barrels of oil and 26.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas. As of December 31, 1997, daily net production was approximately 758 barrels of oil.
North Frisco City. The North Frisco City field, located in Monroe County, Alabama, was discovered in March 1991. Production is predominantly from the Frisco City sand member of the Haynesville formation at a depth of about 12,000 feet. Based on seismic data, ten successful development wells were completed from 1992 though 1994. In 1994, the field was unitized. The Company currently has a 24.1% working interest in nine gross producing wells in the unit. As of December 31, 1997, daily net production from this field was 1,102 barrels of oil, 202 barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,161 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. The Company also owns a royalty interest in this field.
Grass Creek. The Grass Creek Unit, located in the Bighorn Basin in Hot Springs County, Wyoming, is operated by Marathon Oil Company. Oil was discovered in the Frontier formation in 1914. The Company's working interest within the Grass Creek field differs by horizon, varying from 13% in the Curtis to 37.65% in the Darwin. The Company owns a 31% working interest in the primary horizons, the Phosphoria and Tensleep, which are mature waterfloods. Current net production is approximately 938 barrels of oil per day. In February 1996, a 3-D seismic survey was acquired over the field. Based upon that data, the Company has identified numerous potential drilling opportunities. Grass Creek field is also a candidate for enhanced oil recovery using CO2.
LaBarge Project. The LaBarge Project, operated by Exxon Company USA, is located in southwestern Wyoming. The Company owns a 4.8% working interest in the Fogarty Creek Unit. The Company has an interest in 12 gross wells producing from depths between 14,500 feet to 17,000 feet in the Fogarty Creek Unit. The Company has significant production and reserves of carbon dioxide and helium and small amounts of production and reserves of sulfur from its interest in the LaBarge Project, which are not included in its production and proved reserves of oil and natural gas discussed elsewhere in Item 2. The table on the next page presents information on the Company's net production of natural gas, carbon dioxide and helium attributable to the Company's interest in the LaBarge Project. The natural gas data from the LaBarge Project is also included in the other tables set forth elsewhere in Item 2.
