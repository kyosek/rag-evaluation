The following information is presented for the only property whose cost basis exceeds 10% of the gross proceeds of the Offering.
On July 21, 1989, the Partnership and Brauvin High Yield Fund L.P. II ("BHYF II"), an affiliated public real estate limited partnership, formed a joint venture, Brauvin Funds Joint Venture ("Funds JV"), to purchase a Scandinavian Health Spa (the "Health Spa") in Glendale, Arizona from an unaffiliated developer for $5,250,000, plus closing costs. The Health Spa was constructed in 1988. The Health Spa is subject to a triple-net lease with the lessee, Scandinavian U.S. Swim & Fitness, Inc., which is responsible for paying all taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs. The lease terminates in 2009. The rent is payable in equal monthly installments and was increased by 11.5% on February 1, 1994 and was to increase by 11.5% every five years thereafter. The lease is guaranteed by Bally's Health and Tennis Corporation whose financial statements reflected a net worth of approximately $275 million at the time of acquisition. On this basis, the General Partners determined that no rent insurance would be required by the Partnership.
The Partnership contributed $2,585,608 (49%) to Funds JV and BHYF II contributed $2,691,143 (51%). Taxable income and distributable cash flow have been and will continue to be allocated according to the venturers' respective capital contributions.

Risks of Ownership
Prior to the sale of the Partnership's properties the possibility existed that the tenants may have been unable to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the terms of their leases, including making base rent or percentage rent payments to the Partnership. Such a default by the tenants or a premature termination of any one of the leases could have had an adverse effect on the financial position of the Partnership. Furthermore, the Partnership may have been unable to successfully locate a substitute tenant due to the fact that these buildings have been designed or built primarily to house a specific operation. Thus, the properties may not have been readily marketable to a new tenant without substantial capital improvements or remodeling. Such improvements may have required expenditure of Partnership funds otherwise available for distribution.
