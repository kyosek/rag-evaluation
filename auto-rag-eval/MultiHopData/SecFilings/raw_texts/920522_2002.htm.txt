Item 2. Properties
The Company's property portfolio (including partial ownership interests) consists of ownership interests in 112 multifamily properties (comprising 23,699 apartment units), of which 13,654 units are located in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), 4,023 units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), 5,444 of which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,073 units in the Seattle metropolitan area and 1,371 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area), and 578 are located in other areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276 units in Hemet, California). In addition, the Company owns other real estate assets consisting of five recreational vehicle parks (comprising 1,717 spaces), four office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540 square feet) and two manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites). One of the office buildings located in Northern California (Palo Alto) has approximately 17,400 square feet and houses the Company's headquarters and another office building located in Southern California (Woodland Hills) has approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the Company currently occupies approximately 6,800 square feet. The Woodland Hills office building has ten third party tenants occupying approximately 27,300 feet. The Company along with its affiliated entities and joint ventures also have entered into commitments for the development of 1,518 units in six multifamily communities; three of which are in Northern California and three in Southern California. See page 7 for a list of our properties under development.
The Company's multifamily Properties accounted for in excess of 94% of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Occupancy Rates
The 112 multifamily residential properties had an average occupancy, based on "financial occupancy," during the year ended December 31, 2002, of approximately 95%. With respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy, which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy.
As of December 31, 2002, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the Company and the Southern California office building was 88% occupied, based on physical occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With respect to recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, none of the Company's Properties had book values equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross revenues equal to 10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.
Multifamily Residential Properties
The Company's multifamily Properties are generally suburban garden apartments and townhomes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land. The multifamily properties have on average 212 units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom units. A wide variety of amenities are available at each apartment community, including, covered parking, wood-burning fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with complete fitness facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts.
Most of the multifamily Properties are designed for and marketed to people in white-collar or technical professions. The Company selects, trains and supervises a full team of on-site service and maintenance personnel. The Company believes that its customer service approach enhances its ability to retain tenants and that its multifamily Properties were built well and have been maintained well since acquisition.
