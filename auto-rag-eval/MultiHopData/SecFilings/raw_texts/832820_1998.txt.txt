Oil and Gas Properties
The following table sets forth data as of December 31, 1998 regarding the number of gross producing wells and the estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Company's principal properties.
Set forth below are descriptions of certain of the Company's significant oil and gas producing properties and those targeted for significant drilling activity in 1999. There can be no assurance that any of the wells proposed to be drilled will be completed, or if completed, will be economically viable.
Mid-Continent Region
Overview
The Mid-Continent Region is primarily comprised of producing properties in the Anadarko, Ardmore, Arklatex, Arkoma, Michigan and Permian Basins. The Company views the Mid-Continent region as providing a solid base of production replacement and plans to continue to exploit areas within the various basins that require additional wells for adequate reserve drainage and to drill low-risk exploration wells. These wells are generally stepout and extension type wells with moderate reserve exposure. The Company endeavors to be the operator when it holds a working interest of greater than 50%.
Estimated proved reserves in the Mid-Continent Region were 135.1 Bcfe as of December 31, 1998 representing approximately 44% of the Company's reserves. During the year ended December 31, 1998, in this Region the Company participated in drilling 41 gross (19.8 net) development wells and 8 gross (4.8 net) exploratory wells with a completion success rate of 78% and 50%, respectively. At December 31, 1998, the Company owned leasehold interests within the Mid-Continent Region covering approximately 315,313 gross (180,061 net) acres.
Description of the Mid-Continent Properties
Sawyer Canyon and Sonora Fields, West Texas
The Company's holdings in the Sawyer Canyon Field are located in Sutton County, Texas. The Company owns interests in 342 gross (308 net) wells, of which it operates 331 gross (299 net) wells. The Company's average working interest in this field was 90%, and its leasehold position at December 31, 1998 consisted of approximately 36,900 gross (36,100 net) acres. The main producing formation in the Sawyer Canyon Field is the Canyon sandstone at a depth of approximately 5,500 feet. These Canyon reservoirs tend to be discontinuous and generally exhibit lower porosity and permeability, characteristics which reduce the area that can be effectively drained by a single well to units as small as 40 acres.
The Company's proved reserves attributable to the Sawyer Canyon Field at December 31, 1998 are 94% proved developed. The Company currently plans to drill up to ten additional locations to exploit the remaining proved undeveloped reserves. The Company also believes that additional reserves may ultimately be attributed to many of the 30 or more, 40-acre drilling locations remaining on the property. In addition to exploiting these Canyon sand development opportunities, the Company intends to continue to evaluate portions of the Sawyer Canyon Field for potential in the shallower Wolfcamp and deeper Strawn formations which have been found to be productive in the area.
Elm Grove Field, Louisiana
The Company's reserve holdings in the Elm Grove Field in Bossier Parish, Louisiana are 84% proved developed. Production from the Elm Grove Field is primarily natural gas from the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations at depths of 7,000 to 9,600 feet. As of December 31, 1998, the Company owned an interest in 26 gross (23 net) wells, all of which are operated by the Company. The Company's operated leasehold position consisted of approximately 5,760 gross (5,545 net) acres. The Company drilled and completed two Cotton Valley wells in 1998. The Company has identified additional recompletions and potential development well locations which may be drilled in 1999.
Mayfield / Hayes and Other Niagaran Reef Fields, Michigan
The Company's Michigan Niagaran Reef trend properties were acquired in December 1995. The Company acquired a volumetric production payment contract covering varying interests in 118 wells. The Company also purchased a working interest in 28 of those wells. Because the producer delivering volumes to the Company under the volumetric production payment contract failed to reimburse the Company for operating expenses advanced by the Company, in 1998 the Company foreclosed on and acquired all of the working interests in the wells. The major property on which the wells are located is the Mayfield - 28 Field.
Wilburton Field, Oklahoma
The Company's 1998 activity in the Wilburton Field, Latimer County, Oklahoma featured the drilling of the prolific Commissioner #14-1 well which is producing from the Atoka Bullard sand at approximately 10,000 feet in depth. The Company owns a 69% working interest in and is the operator of this well. Two more productive wells have recently been drilled to the Bullard in this field with the Company owning a 10% and a 7% working interest, respectively. Additional drilling is planned for 1999 to further develop the Atoka sands on the Company's acreage holdings of 800 gross (235 net) acres.
Mills Ranch Field, Texas
The Company owns working interests varying from less than 1% to approximately 25% in 25 producing wells in this Wheeler County, Texas field. The deep Hunton formation at approximately 20,000 feet in depth has been the primary producing zone. During the last year, several companies including KCS have been successfully developing the shallower Granite Wash interval at approximately 11,500 feet in depth with four wells drilled in 1998. The Company plans to participate in a number of additional wells in 1999 to further develop Granite Wash reserves on its 7,807 gross (1,850 net) acres in this field.
West Shugart Field, New Mexico
The Company recently completed a well in the West Shugart Field located in Eddy County, New Mexico, in which it has a 100% working interest. During an initial 24-hour test on November 6, 1998, the Shugart Federal #19-1 well flowed at a rate exceeding 1,000 bbl of oil per day and 230 Mcf of gas per day from the Bore Springs Dolomite formation at approximately 8,200 feet. Since that time, the well has been flowing at a restricted steady rate of approximately 230 bbl of oil per day as dictated by New Mexico regulations. This well also has three additional potentially productive zones. The Company's acreage position in this field of 800 gross (778.4 net) acres is sufficient for up to 19 additional wells.
Newhall-Potrero Field, California
The Company's Newhall-Potrero Field is located in Los Angeles County, California, outside the city of Valencia. At December 31, 1998, net proved reserves were 7,689 MMcfe, all of which were proved developed. The Company is the operator and owns a 100% working interest in 39 active wells. The Company has been able to maintain the oil production at or above the same production rates as the field was producing when it was acquired in 1993 by converting certain wells from gas lift to pumping unit operations and reworking other wells. The Company
was also able to reduce the per barrel lifting cost. The Company continues to pursue other production enhancement opportunities in the Newhall-Potrero Field.
Onshore Gulf Coast Region
Overview
The Onshore Gulf Coast Region is primarily comprised of producing properties in south Texas, coastal Louisiana and the Mississippi Salt Basin. The Company conducts development programs and pursues moderate-risk, higher-exposure exploration drilling programs. The expanding Onshore Gulf Coast Region has prospects which are expected to provide the key area of future growth for the Company. Estimated proved reserves in the region were 72.0 Bcfe as of December 31, 1998, which represented approximately 23% of the Company's reserves.
During 1998 the Company drilled 5 gross (2.9 net) development wells and 5 gross (2.3 net) exploratory wells in the Onshore Gulf Coast Region. The 1998 success rates were 80% for development wells and 40% for exploratory wells. The Company owns or controls approximately 153,000 gross (78,000 net) acres in its Onshore Gulf Coast Region.
Description of the Onshore Gulf Coast Properties
Cypress/Langham Creek Field, Texas
This area is comprised of the Cypress, Cypress Deep and Langham Creek fields in western Harris County, Texas, where the Company has interests in and is the operator of 12,726 gross (6,311 net) acres. Multiple horizons in this area produce oil and gas from Eocene age sandstone in the Yegua formation at depths of 6,000 to 7,500 feet and in the Wilcox formation at depths of 9,000 to 16,500 feet.
The Company acquired additional working interests in the Langham Creek Field in May 1997, which added 14,000 MMcfe of proved reserves. With this, the Company's third acquisition in the Langham Creek Field, the Company assumed operatorship and now owns working interests varying from 33% to 87% in 18 wells in this area. The Company has recently acquired a 3-D seismic survey over the Langham Creek Field and has completed a comprehensive field study. Five to eight exploitation wells will be scheduled over the next 18 to 24 months to further develop this field. Additional reservoir potential will be tested in the deep Wilcox zones, which were found productive in a 16,500-foot well drilled during late 1997 on the north flank of the field.
Bob West Field, Texas
The Company has interests in approximately 862 gross (395 net) acres in the Bob West Field located in Zapata and Star counties, Texas. The field produces natural gas from a series of 20 different Upper Wilcox sands with formation depths ranging from 9,500 to 13,500 feet that require stimulation by hydraulic fracturing to recover the reserves effectively. Because the majority of the Bob West Field is situated under Lake Falcon on the Rio Grande River, most wells were drilled directionally under the lake from common lakeshore drill sites.
The Company owns interests in two principal areas in the Bob West Field. The Company has an effective 12.5% working interest in all production from the Guerra "A" and Guerra "B" units containing 34 producing wells. The Company also owns a 100% working interest in 511 acres referred to as the Falcon/Bob West Field which contains 16 producing natural gas wells.
Dickinson Field, Texas
The Company has a leasehold position of approximately 1,477 acres (including 388 fee acres) and operates 22 wells and an eight-inch pipeline in the Dickinson Field located in Galveston County, Texas. The Company's working interest in the property is 100% in the producing horizons and its net revenue interest in various leases ranges from 90.6% to 93.8%. The Dickinson Field consists of several complex faulted reservoirs that overlie a deep-seated piercement salt dome. Production occurs from 18 separate Frio reservoirs at depths between 7,000 and 10,000 feet.
The Dickinson Field was producing 1,800 Mcf of gas per day and 10 bbl of oil per day when acquired on April 10, 1998. Since then, the Company has more than doubled the field production. In December 1998, the Company acquired a 3-D seismic survey over the field. Additional workover and exploration drilling opportunities exist in this field.
North Padre Field, Texas
The Company recently acquired a 75% working interest in approximately 700 gross acres in this field which is located in Kleberg County, Texas. Re-development of this field to recover low pressure reserves is scheduled for early 2000 with the drilling of two new wells and the re-entry of an existing well.
North Clara Field, Mississippi
The Company owns a 20% working interest in the recently announced discovery at the North Clara Field in Wayne County, Mississippi. This well was drilled and completed in the Smackover formation at a depth of 16,500 feet. The well was placed on production in January 1999 and is currently producing approximately 3,500 Mcf of gas and 794 barrels of condensate per day with 7,000 pounds of flowing tubing pressure. A 3-D seismic survey covering the Company's 2,300-acre leasehold is currently under way. Additional development wells are scheduled for this field in late 1999.
The Company also has a 25% working interest in two other Mississippi Salt Basin prospects, West Clara and Pool Creek, that encompass approximately 9,000 acres. These prospects have Upper Jurassic, Cotton Valley and Smackover potential. Several recent discoveries have been made along salt ridges in these reservoirs. A 3-D survey was shot across the West Clara prospect last year and the first well for this area will be spudded during 1999.
Glasscock Ranch, Texas
The Company owns an 89.5% working interest in this field which is located in Colorado County, Texas. KCS currently has eight active wells in the field and two additional development locations remain to be drilled.
Rocky Mountain Region
Overview
In the Rocky Mountain Region, the Company's operations are focused primarily in the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming. Operationally, this geographic region reports to the Mid-Continent Division. In mid-1998, because of particularly low commodity prices in this region, and disappointing drilling results, the Company curtailed its capital spending program in this area and implemented a cost-reduction plan which has reduced operating and administrative expenses. Until commodity prices improve significantly, the Company plans no substantial development or exploration activity in the Rocky Mountain Region.
Estimated proved reserves in the Rocky Mountain Region were 49.6 Bcfe as of December 31, 1998 representing approximately 16% of the Company's reserves. During 1998, the Company drilled 9 gross (9 net) development wells and 6 gross (4.8 net) exploratory wells in the Rocky Mountain Region. As of December 31, 1998, the Company owned working interests covering approximately 470,723 gross (321,747 net) acres in the area, primarily in the Big Horn Basin.
Description of the Rocky Mountain Properties
Manderson Field, Wyoming
The Manderson Field is located in the Big Horn Basin of north central Wyoming. The field has established production from multiple reservoirs, which range in depth from 4,500 to 7,800 feet and include the Frontier, Octh Louie, Muddy, Phosphoria and Tensleep formations.
Both the Phosphoria and Tensleep formations produce hydrogen sulfide associated with oil and natural gas. The presence of sour gas and the limitations imposed by the State of Wyoming created the need for a sour gas processing facility (amine plant) and an associated acid gas injection system. The Company's amine plant has the design capacity to treat up to 28,000 Mcf of sour gas (20% hydrogen sulfide content level) per day to pipeline specifications. The Company is seeking production from other well operators to utilize the plant's excess capacity. The other formations in the area produce relatively sweet oil and natural gas.
Since acquiring its interest in the field in 1995, the Company has drilled 74 total wells of which 53 were drilled to the Phosphoria formation. The Company's recent efforts to redevelop the Manderson Field with closer spacing have resulted in 25 new wells currently producing from the Phosphoria formation. Twenty-seven wells are currently producing from the other productive formations listed above. Economic results of this program have been less than expected due to low oil prices and the stratagraphic nature of the Dolomite zone.
The Company's holdings in the Manderson area are approximately 60,000 gross (56,405 net) acres as of December 31, 1998. At December 31, 1998, the Company's proved reserves in the Manderson Field included 1,187 Mbbls of oil and 18,367 MMcf of natural gas representing 8% of the Company's proved reserves.
Dragon Trail Field, Colorado
The Company owns a 16% working interest in the Dragon Trail Field located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. This field produces from the Mancos sand at approximately 3,000 feet in depth. Several test wells to the shallower Mancos silt formation are planned in 1999.
Battle Creek Field, Montana
The Company owns a 45% working interest in the Battle Creek Field in Blaine County, Montana. This field produces gas from the Eagle formation at approximately 2,000 feet in depth. The Company plans to continue improving the deliverability of the field as needed to meet market demands through the use of hydraulic fracture stimulations. Acreage holdings in this area are approximately 4,500 gross (2,000 net) developed acres with another 6,300 gross (2,800 net) undeveloped acres.
Fourteen Mile Field, Wyoming
The Company owns a 100% working interest and an 85.5% net revenue interest in this field located in Washakie County, Wyoming. The Company's holdings in this field are approximately 45,300 gross (44,700 net) acres of which approximately 1,500 gross and net acres have been developed. A geologic study is under way to better define future development potential.
Gulf of Mexico Region
Overview
The Gulf of Mexico Region includes assets that can be characterized in three categories: 1) Working interest properties obtained through the Medallion Acquisition; 2) Proved reserves acquired through VPP transactions; 3)
Properties originally obtained through VPPs and subsequently converted to overriding royalty interests. Proved reserves for these properties were estimated as of December 31, 1998 to be 53.1 Bcfe, representing approximately 17% of the Company's reserves.
Working Interest Properties
The Company has working interests ranging from 4% to 14% in 12 offshore fields (including blocks located in the East Cameron, Eugene Island, Ship Shoal, South Timbalier, Vermilion and West Cameron areas) which are operated by other companies, primarily Newfield Exploration Company.
Conventional VPPs
Through a series of VPP transactions, the Company has acquired certain interests in 12 federal leases off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Major fields include the High Island 303/304, the West Cameron 427 and the South Marsh Island 17.
Other Offshore Interests
The Company has acquired interests in eight blocks which are primarily located in shallow waters offshore from Texas and Louisiana, including Brazos 544, Garden Banks 134, Vermillion 277 and several others, through its VPP Program. In April 1998, the Company converted its limited-term overriding royalty VPP to an overriding royalty which covers the entire life of the properties.
Volumetric Production Payment (VPP)Program
The Company augments its working interest ownership of properties with its VPP Program, a method of acquiring proved oil and gas reserves from specified wells scheduled to be delivered in the future, at a discount to the current market price, in exchange for an up-front cash payment. Although specific terms of the Company's volumetric production payments vary, the Company is generally entitled to receive delivery of its scheduled oil and gas volumes free of drilling and lease operating costs and, in most cases, free of state severance taxes. After delivery of the oil and gas volumes, the Company arranges for further downstream transportation and sells such volumes to available markets. The Company believes that its VPP Program diversifies its reserve base and achieves attractive rates of return while minimizing the Company's exposure to certain development and operating risks. Typically, the estimated proved reserves of the properties underlying a volumetric production payment are substantially greater than the specified reserve volumes required to be delivered pursuant to the production payment.
Since the inception of the VPP Program in late 1994, the Company had invested $195.8 million in 25 separate transactions and had acquired proved reserves of 115.3 Bcfe, consisting of 105.7 Bcf of natural gas and 1,611 Mbbls of oil. This represents an average net acquisition cost of $1.70 per Mcfe, without the burden of development and lease operating expenses. Through December 31, 1998, the Company had recovered approximately $128.6 million from the sale of oil and gas received under its VPP Program. The properties which constitute the VPP Program are principally located in the Gulf of Mexico.
During 1998, the Company invested $73.5 million in nine separate VPP transactions and acquired 41,123 MMcf of natural gas and 338 Mbbls of oil, located in the Gulf of Mexico.
Although it has not done so in the past, the Company is exploring the financing of future VPP acquisitions through joint venture partnerships or similar arrangements with third parties.
Hedging Activities
The Company seeks to manage the price risk related to future production of natural gas by entering into various commodity price swaps, futures contracts and options on futures contracts. As of December 31, 1998, approximately 12.6 Bcf of 1999 production was hedged at an average price of $2.25 per MMbtu. For the years 2000 through 2005, a total of approximately 13.8 Bcf are hedged at an average price of $2.06 per MMbtu.
Oil and Gas Reserves
All information in this Form 10-K relating to estimates of the Company's proved reserves is based on reports prepared by KCS and several independent petroleum engineers. The reports for the KCS Medallion Resources, Inc.; KCS Mountain Resources, Inc.; KCS Resources, Inc.; and KCS Michigan Resources, Inc. properties, which collectively represent 100% of the KCS proved reserves on working interest properties, and 85.4% of total KCS proved reserves at December 31, 1998, were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. pursuant to the principles set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The independent reserve engineers' estimates were based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data provided by the Company or third-party operators.
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 1998, summary information with respect to (1) the estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves attributable to working interests and (2) the reserve amounts contracted for pursuant to the agreements relating to VPPs. The present value of future net revenues in the table should not be construed to be the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves owned by the Company.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and future amounts and timing of development expenditures, including underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves are inherently less certain than estimates of proved developed reserves. The quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures, geologic success and future oil and gas sales prices all may differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, the Company's reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore, the present value shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the Company's properties.
In accordance with SEC guidelines, the estimates of future net revenues from the Company's proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of natural gas contracts, the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. Average realized natural gas prices were $2.15 per Mcf and average realized oil prices were $8.57 per barrel at December 31, 1998. The prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil, are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations, and prices for each are subject to substantial fluctuations as a result of numerous other factors. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Acreage
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Company's developed and undeveloped leased acreage as of December 31, 1998. The leases in which the Company has an interest are for varying primary terms, and many require the payment of delay rentals to continue the primary term. The leases may be surrendered by the operator at any time by notice to the lessors, by the cessation of production, fulfillment of commitments, or by failure to make timely payments of delay rentals. Excluded from the table are the Company's interests in the properties subject to volumetric production payments.
Drilling Activities
All of the Company's drilling activities are conducted through arrangements with independent contractors. Certain information with regard to the Company's drilling activities during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, is set forth below.
At December 31, 1998, the Company was participating in the drilling or completion of 2 gross (1.4 net) wells.
PART II
Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.
In accordance with the terms of its debt agreements, the Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources and Notes 2 and 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company had been paying regular quarterly dividends from the first quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1999. The aggregate amount of dividends declared were $2,345,000 and $2,204,000 in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
There were 1,141 stockholders of record of the Company's Common Stock on March 1, 1999.
