In the third and fourth quarters of of 1998, provisions for loss of $3.0 million and $916,000, respectively, were recorded to write down the Valley Ranch land to its estimated realizable value less estimated costs of sale. Such write downs were necessitated by an increase in the acreage designated as flood plain.
In February 1999, the Company purchased Frisco Bridges land, a 336.8 parcel of unimproved land in Collin County, Texas, for $46.8 million. The Company paid $7.8 million in cash and obtained mortgage financing totaling $39.0 million.

A gain will be recognized on the sale.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income-producing real estate. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound, and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, the Company may acquire existing mortgage loans either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1998 consisted of an office building, shopping centers, improved land and partnership interests. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgages in which the Company invests without a vote of stockholders.
At December 31, 1998, the obligors on $594,000 or 1.1% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of the Company. Also at that date, $9.2 million or 16.8% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were nonperforming.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage loan balance at December 31, 1998), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Company's mortgage notes receivable. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for additional details of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1998 is as follows:
- -------- * Includes a mortgage note receivable collateralized by two condominium mortgage loans in 1997 and one condominium mortgage loan in 1998.
During 1998, the Company collected $188,000 in interest and $7.9 million in principal on its mortgage notes receivable.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in first mortgage loans, with either short-, medium- or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal or all interest and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Company's general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the Company's mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1998.
At December 31, 1998, the Company sold a matured first mortgage note at its carrying value of $124,000 to BCM. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. See "Junior Mortgage Loans," below.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage note is a mortgage note having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties on which it would otherwise make a first mortgage loan.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1998.
In June 1992, the Company sold the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, for, among other consideration, a $22.0 million wraparound mortgage note. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $4.6 million on the sale resulting from a disputed third lien mortgage being subordinated to the Company's wraparound mortgage note. In March 1997, the wraparound note was modified and extended in exchange for the borrower's commitment to invest $2.0 million in improvements to the hotel and casino within four months of March 1997, and an additional $2.0 million prior to December 1997. The borrower stopped making the payments required by the note in April 1997, and did not make the required improvements. In December 1997, the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. In February 1998, a hearing was held to allow foreclosure of the hotel and casino. At the hearing, the bankruptcy court allowed the borrower 90 days to submit a reorganization plan and beginning March 2, 1998 required the borrower to make monthly payments of $175,000. The Company received only the first such payment. The wraparound mortgage note had a principal balance of $22.7 million at March 31, 1998. In April 1998, the bankruptcy court allowed the foreclosure of the hotel and casino. No loss was incurred on foreclosure as the fair value of the property, exceeded the carrying value of the mortgage note receivable.
In December 1997, the Company sold its Pin Oak land, a 567.6 acre parcel of unimproved land in Houston, Texas, for $11.4 million, receiving net cash of $3.5 million and providing $6.9 million in short-term purchase money financing. The purchase money financing was collected in full in January 1998, the Company receiving net cash of $1.5 million after paying off $5.2 million in underlying mortgage debt and the payment of various closing costs.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such notes are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such notes ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the loan, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 1998.
In December 1997, the Company sold a 25.1 acre tract of its Valley Ranch land parcel, for $3.3 million, receiving net cash of $2.2 million and providing $891,000 of short-term purchase money financing. The Company received a $624,000 paydown on the purchase money financing in January 1998 with the remaining $267,000 being received in February 1998.
As of December 31, 1998, the Company sold two matured second lien mortgage notes at their carrying values totaling $504,000 to BCM. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. See "First Mortgage Loans," above.
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships
Real estate entities. The Company's investment in real estate entities includes (1) equity securities of three publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (collectively the "REITs"), CMET, IORI and TCI, (2) units of limited partner interest of NRLP, and (3) interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. BCM, the Company's advisor, serves as advisor to the REITs, and performs certain administrative and management functions for NRLP and NOLP on behalf of NMC, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP in 1989, the Company has made additional investments in the equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The cost with respect to shares of the REITs at December 31, 1998 totaled $22.0 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $24.1 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of such equity securities of the REITs was $29.0 million at December 31, 1998 and the aggregate market value of such equity securities was $43.5 million. The aggregate investee book value of the equity securities of the REITs based upon the December 31, 1998 financial statements of each such REIT was $71.0 million. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
The Board of Directors has authorized the expenditure of up to an aggregate of $35.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, units of NRLP and shares of the REITs, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had expended $4.4 million to acquire units of NRLP and an aggregate of $6.4 million to acquire shares of the REITs, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. The Company expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP.
The equity securities of the REITs and NRLP were purchased for the purpose of investment based principally on the opinion of management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination to purchase additional equity securities of the REITs and NRLP is made on an entity-by-entity basis and depends on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities. Substantially all of the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP are pledged as collateral for borrowings. Pertinent information regarding the Company's investment in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP, at December 31, 1998, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
- -------- * The Company accounted for its investment in the Partnership under the equity method until December 1998 when NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was elected general partner of NRLP and NOLP, as more fully discussed in "NRLP", below. As of December 31, 1998, the accounts of the Partnership are consolidated with those of the Company.
Each of the REITs and NRLP own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, particularly in the case of NRLP, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. The Company's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
The Company does not have a controlling equity interest in any of the REITs and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of such investees. However, due to the Company's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of the REITs, and that the REITs have the same advisor as the Company and that Mr. Paulson, an Executive Vice President of the Company, is also the President of the REITs and BCM, the Company's advisor. The Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of the REITs. The Company accounts for its investment in the REITs using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of the REITs currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The Company discontinued accounting for its investment in the Partnership under the equity method as of December 31, 1998, due to the election of NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as general partner of NRLP and NOLP, as more fully discussed in "NRLP" below. The carrying value of the Company's investment in the REITs, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of each REIT's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of NRLP and the REITs, based upon information publicly reported by such entities.
NRLP. NRLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership which was formed under the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act on January 29, 1987. It commenced operations on September 18, 1987 when, through NOLP, it acquired all of the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of 35 public and private limited partnerships. NRLP is the sole limited partner of NOLP and owns 99% of the beneficial interest in NOLP. NRLP and NOLP operate as an economic unit and, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Partnership shall constitute references to NRLP and NOLP as a unit. In December 1998, NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was elected general partner and succeeded to SAMLP's 1% beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP. NMC also assumed liability for SAMLP's note for its capital contribution. In addition, NMC assumed liability for a note which requires the repayment of the $11.4 million paid by the Partnership under the Moorman litigation settlement plus the $808,000 in court ordered attorney's fees and the $30,000 paid to Joseph B. Moorman.
In November 1992, NOLP transferred 52 apartments and a wraparound mortgage note receivable to GCLP, a Delaware limited partnership in which NOLP owns a 99.3% limited partner interest. Concurrent with such transfer, GCLP refinanced all of the mortgage debt associated with the transferred properties and the wraparound mortgage note. Effective August 1998, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the .7% managing general partner interest of Garden Capital Management Incorporated in GCLP and the 1% general partner interest of Garden Capital Incorporated in 50 single asset limited partnerships in which GCLP is the 99% limited partner, in exchange for 250,000 shares of the Company's Series F Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.
At December 31, 1998, the Company owned approximately 55.0% of the outstanding limited partner units of NRLP.
NMC, as the general partner, has discretion in determining the methods of obtaining funds for the Partnership's operations, and the acquisition and disposition of its assets.
At December 31, 1998, NRLP owned 66 properties located in 21 states, consisting of 55 apartments comprising 13,957 units, five office buildings with an aggregate of 367,271 square feet and six shopping centers with an aggregate of 712,388 sq. ft.
The Partnership reported net income of $47.5 million in 1998 compared to net income of $8.7 million in 1997. The Partnership had a loss from operations, prior to gains on sale of real estate, of $5.1 million in 1998 compared to income of $362,000 in 1997. The decline in the Partnership's 1998 income from operations was due to $13.0 million of GCLP deferred borrowing costs written off on the refinancing of the GCLP properties in 1998 and the sale of 10 apartments and two shopping centers by the Partnership in 1998. The decline was mitigated by a 4% increase in average rental rates at the Partnership's apartments and an average 4% increase in rental rates at the Partnership's commercial properties coupled with an average 1% decrease in occupancy at the Partnership's apartments and an average 3.5% decrease in occupancy at the Partnership's commercial properties.
The Partnership's cash flow from property operations (rents collected less payments for property operations) decreased to $42.9 million in 1998 from $50.5 million in 1997. At December 31, 1998, the Partnership had total assets of $337.8 million, which consisted of $167.4 million of real estate held for investment, $114.5 million of notes and interest receivable, $46.9 million of investments in equity securities and other assets and $9.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The Partnership has paid quarterly distributions to unitholders since the fourth quarter of 1993. In 1998, the Company received a total of $7.2 million in distributions from the Partnership including $5.5 million which was accrued at December 31, 1997.
The Company owns a 96% limited partner interest in SAMLP. SAMLP was the general partner of the Partnership until December 18, 1998 when NMC, a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company, was elected general partner. Gene E. Phillips, a Director and Chairman of the Board of the Company until November 16, 1992, is also a general partner of SAMLP.
NRLP, SAMLP and Mr. Phillips were among the defendants in a class action lawsuit (the "Moorman litigation") arising from the formation of NRLP. An agreement settling such lawsuit (the "Settlement Agreement") for the above named defendants became effective on July 5, 1990. The Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the appointment of an NRLP oversight committee and the establishment of specified annually increasing targets for five years relating to the price of NRLP's units of limited partner interest.
The Settlement Agreement provided for the resignation and replacement of SAMLP as general partner if the unit price targets were not met for two consecutive anniversary dates. NRLP did not meet the unit price targets for the first and second anniversary dates. On July 8, 1992, SAMLP notified the NRLP oversight committee of the failure of NRLP to meet the unit price targets for two successive years and that it expected to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The Settlement Agreement provided that the withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner would require the Partnership to purchase SAMLP's general partner interest (the "Redeemable General Partner Interest") at its then fair value, and to pay certain fees and other compensation as provided in the NRLP partnership agreement. Syntek Asset Management, Inc. ("SAMI"), the managing general partner of SAMLP, calculated the fair value of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be $49.6 million at December 31, 1997, before reduction for the principal balance ($4.2 million at December 31, 1997) and accrued interest ($7.2 million at December 31, 1997) on the note receivable from SAMLP for its original capital contribution to the Partnership.
On July 15, 1998, NRLP, SAMLP and the NRLP oversight committee executed an Agreement for Cash Distribution and Election of Successor General Partner (the "Cash Distribution Agreement") which provides for the nomination of an entity affiliated with SAMLP to be the successor general partner of NRLP, for the distribution of $11.4 million to the plaintiff class members and for the resolution of all related matters under the Settlement Agreement. The Cash Distribution Agreement was submitted to the Court on July 23, 1998. On August 4, 1998, the Court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the Cash Distribution Agreement. On September 9, 1998, a notice was mailed to the plaintiff class members describing the Cash Distribution Agreement. On October 16, 1998, a hearing was held to consider any objections to the Cash Distribution
Agreement. On October 23, 1998, the Court entered an order granting final approval of the Cash Distribution Agreement. The Court also entered orders requiring NRLP to pay $404,000 in attorney's fees to Joseph B. Moorman's legal counsel, $30,000 to Joseph B. Moorman and $404,000 in attorney's fees to Robert A. McNeil's legal counsel.
Pursuant to the order, $11.4 million was deposited by the Partnership into an escrow account and then transferred to the control of an independent settlement administrator. The distribution of the cash shall be made to the plaintiff class members pro rata based upon the number of units originally issued to each plaintiff class member upon the formation of the Partnership in 1987. On March 10, 1999, the Court entered an order providing for the initial distribution of the cash not later than March 31, 1999. The distribution of cash is under the control of the independent settlement administrator.
The proposal to elect NMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as the successor general partner was submitted to the unitholders of NRLP for a vote at a special meeting held on December 18, 1998. All units of NRLP owned by affiliates of the Company and SAMLP (approximately 61.8% of the outstanding units of NRLP as of the November 27, 1998 record date) were voted pro rata with the vote of the other limited partners. NMC was elected by a majority of the NRLP unitholders. On December 18, 1998, SAMLP withdrew as general partner and NMC took office. Upon the election and taking office of NMC as the successor general partner, the Settlement Agreement terminated.
Under the Cash Distribution Agreement, SAMLP waived its right under the Settlement Agreement to receive any payment from the Partnership for its Redeemable General Partner Interest and fees it was entitled to receive upon the election of a successor general partner. In addition, pursuant to the Cash Distribution Agreement, the NRLP partnership agreement was amended to provide that, upon voluntary resignation of the general partner, the resigning general partner shall not be entitled to the repurchase of its general partner interest under Paragraph 17.9 of the NRLP partnership agreement.
Under the Cash Distribution Agreement, NMC, as successor general partner, assumed liability for the note from SAMLP for its capital contribution to NRLP. In addition, NMC assumed liability for a note which requires the repayment of the $11.4 million paid by NRLP under the Cash Distribution Agreement, plus the $808,000 in Court ordered attorney's fees and the $30,000 paid to Joseph B. Moorman. This note requires repayment over a ten-year period, bears interest at a variable rate, currently 7.2% per annum and is guaranteed by the Company. As of December 31, 1998, the Company discontinued accounting for its investment in the Partnership under the equity method upon the election of NMC as general partner of the Partnership and the settlement of the Moorman litigation. The Company began consolidation of the Partnership's accounts at that date and its operations subsequent to that date.
CMET. CMET is a California business trust which was organized on August 27, 1980 and commenced operations on December 3, 1980. CMET's business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships and financing real estate and real estate related activities through investments in mortgage notes. CMET holds equity investments in apartments and commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers) throughout the continental United States. CMET's apartments and commercial properties are concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions of the continental United States. At December 31, 1998, CMET owned 57 income producing properties located in 14 states consisting of 34 apartments comprising of 6,158 units, 11 office buildings with an aggregate of 2.1 million sq. ft., 11 industrial warehouses with an aggregate of 1.5 million sq. ft. and a shopping center with 133,558 sq. ft. CMET also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Southeast and Southwest regions.
