Item 2. Description of Property
The following description of the GREKA properties at December 31, 2001 includes all discussions of prior operations of all of GREKA's properties and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
GREKA's Properties as of December 31, 2001
GREKA owned interests in approximately 523 wells at December 31, 2001.
The majority of these wells are concentrated along the central coast of California and in Louisiana. In 2001, California (heavy oil) and Louisiana (gas) were the primary and focused areas of exploitation and development activities. At December 31, 2001, GREKA also operated wells and had exploitation and development activities in other regions of California and in several states outside of California and Louisiana, principally New Mexico and Texas. GREKA's evaluation of international exploration and exploitation projects are in Indonesia and China. The Company continuously evaluates the profitability of its oil, gas and related activities and, as part of its strategic business plan, intends to divest unprofitable leases or areas of operations that are not consistent with its business strategy.
Exploitation and Development Activities
The following is a brief discussion of significant developments in the Company's recent exploitation and development activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries:
United States
California (Integrated)
Approximately 34.8% of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2001 (4.7 MMBOE) were located in four onshore fields in California's central coast region. Daily production from the Central Coast Fields averaged 1,361 BOE for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing 43.3% of GREKA's total production. GREKA operates all of its wells in the Central Coast Fields.
California (E&P)
GREKA also holds interests in other California areas, which represented 30.8% (4.2 MMBOE) of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2001. GREKA's share of daily production from these other interests averaged 684 BOE (1,016 BOE gross) for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing 21.8% of GREKA's total production.
Louisiana
Approximately 31.3% of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2000 (4.2 MMBOE) were located in two fields in Louisiana. GREKA's share of daily production from the Louisiana fields averaged 852 BOE (1,032 BOE gross) for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing 27.1% of the Company's total production.
Other States
In addition to our California and Louisiana properties, GREKA owns producing properties in a number of other states, but primarily New Mexico and Texas, which collectively represented 3.1% of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2001 (0.4 MMBOE). GREKA's share of daily production from these properties averaged 136 BOE (264 BOE gross) for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing 7.8% of GREKA's total production.
GREKA seeks to acquire domestic and international producing properties where it can significantly increase reserves through development or exploitation activities and control costs by serving as operator. GREKA believes that its substantial experience and established relationships in the oil and gas industry enable it to identify, evaluate and acquire high potential properties on favorable terms. As the market for acquisitions has become more competitive in recent years, GREKA has taken the initiative in creating acquisition opportunities, particularly with respect to adjacent properties, by directly soliciting fee owners, as well as working and royalty interest holders, who have not placed their properties on the market.
GREKA's 2002 discretionary capital expenditure budget for properties is dependent upon the price for which its products are sold and upon the ability of GREKA to obtain external financing. Subject to these variables and based on the current asset base, we expect our cash flow and credit facilities to fund
approximately $30 million in 2002 for capital expenditure, which includes the acquisition of Vintage properties for $18 million. The budget is primarily allocated to the development of the Integrated Operations Division.
Exploration Activities
GREKA further plans to expand its existing reserve base by developing high potential exploration prospects in known productive regions. GREKA believes these activities complement its traditional development and exploitation activities. In pursuing these exploration opportunities, GREKA may use advanced technologies, including 3-D seismic and satellite imaging. In addition, GREKA may seek to limit its direct financial exposure in exploration projects by entering into strategic partnerships that shift the drilling related financial risks to partners while providing the Company with an upside upon a successful event. At December 31, 2001, GREKA had exploration plays in three primary areas: California, Indonesia and China.
The following is a brief discussion of significant developments in the Company's recent exploration activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries:
California
Coalinga Nose Exploration Prospect, Fresno County, California. GREKA has leases and contractual rights covering approximately 9,000 acres of land in the region of the prolific Coalinga oil field in the San Joaquin Valley of California. GREKA participated in a 16 square mile 3-D seismic survey covering this area and has interpreted the survey. Nineteen anomalies have been identified in the prospect area, covering five potentially productive zones, ranging in depth from 6,500 to 12,000 feet. GREKA has an 89% working interest below and a 9% working interest above the Gatchell formation in the Leda Prospect, Pleasant Valley, and Cotton Gin Prospects. In April 2001, we entered into a farmout agreement of our 89% interest in the deep rights under the east half of our acreage block in which we retained a 22.25% back-in interest after payout. The farmee drilled the initial well to 11,200' with completion in September 2001. However, this initial well could not be tested, as the integrity of the well bore could not be sustained. The farmee, who abandoned the well in March 2002, did not earn any right to participate in the prospect.
Foreign Operations
Indonesia
West Java Exploration Prospect, Jakarta, Indonesia. GREKA is a party to a production sharing contract, along with Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil company, covering 1.275 million unexplored acres on the Island of Java near a number of producing oil and gas fields. The 30-year contract provides that oil and gas in commercial quantities must be discovered prior to September 2003. A portion of the block has been distinctly identified as the Jonggol area consisting of 500,000 acres. The Jonggol area has two prospects and eleven leads. In March 2002, the Company, which has a 75% interest in the block, entered into an agreement to sell its exploration interests in Indonesia. The sale requires the customary consent by Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil company, that has been requested and is currently pending.
China
Fengcheng Coalbed Methane Exploration Prospect, Jiangxi, China. GREKA is a party to a production sharing contract with the China United Coalbed Methane Corporation Ltd., which contract has been approved by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, to jointly exploit coalbed methane resources in Fengcheng, East China's Jiangxi Province. The contract block in which GREKA has a 49% working interest covers a total area of 380,534 acres. The 30-year contract provides that GREKA as operator will drill at least ten coalbed methane wells over a three year term. Two production test wells have been drilled and were both successful. The Company intends to drill 5 wells in 2002 to prove reserves this year and to thereafter formulate detailed development plans.
Oil and Gas Producing Properties
At December 31, 2001, we owned and operated domestic producing properties in 8 states, with our U.S. proved reserves located primarily in two core areas:
California and Louisiana which represent approximately 65.6% and 31.3%, respectively, of our proved reserves (BOE).
The following table summarizes GREKA's estimated proved oil and gas reserves by geographic area as of December 31, 2001. The following table includes both proved developed (producing and non-producing) and proved undeveloped reserves. Approximately 37.9% of the total reserves reflected in the following table are proved undeveloped. There can be no assurance that the timing of drilling, reworking and other operations, volumes, prices and costs employed by Netherland Sewell & Associates, independent petroleum engineers will prove accurate. Since December 31, 2001, oil and gas prices have generally increased. At such date, the price of WTI crude oil as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $19.84 per Bbl and the comparable price for April 30, 2002 was $27.29. Quotations for the comparable periods for natural gas were $2.57 per Mcf and $3.80 per Mcf, respectively. The proved developed and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserve figures are estimates based on reserve reports prepared by GREKA's independent petroleum engineers Netherland Sewell & Associates. The estimation of reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly with respect to new discoveries. Estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially, depending, in part, on the assumptions made, and may be subject to material adjustment. Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves comprise a substantial portion of GREKA's reserves and, by definition, had not been developed at the time of the engineering estimate. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data as well as engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production or price changes subsequent to the date of the estimate may result in changes to such estimates. The estimates of future net revenues in this report reflect oil and gas prices and production costs as of the date of estimation, without escalation, except where changes in prices were fixed under existing contracts. There can be no assurance that such prices will be realized or that the estimated production volumes will be produced during the periods specified in such reports. The estimated reserves and future net revenues may be subject to material downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. A material decrease in estimated reserves or future net revenues could have a material adverse effect on GREKA and its operations.
December 31, 2001
The following is a brief discussion of our oil and gas operations in our major fields:
California
Central Coast Fields. GREKA's subsidiary operates four fields in the Central Coast area of California. These fields provide equity crude oil for GREKA's wholly owned asphalt refinery. The fields are Cat Canyon, Casmalia, Gato Ridge and Santa Maria Valley which collectively have an average working interest of 100% in 107 active wells producing 1,361 BOEPD (gross). These fields represent 34.8% of GREKA's total proved reserves. In March 2002, we announced a restructuring of our business to focus on the integration of our Central California operations, which assets include our asphalt refinery and these interests in heavy oil fields.
We have established a horizontal drilling program by re-entering existing idle wellbores and drilling short radius laterals utilizing proprietary technology patented from BP Amoco. The reduced cost for re-entries ($125,000 per well) should
contribute to a higher economic success rate and additional economic reserves. Earlier drilling has delineated the S1b Sisquac Sand in the Cat Canyon Field and S2 Sisquac Sand in the Gato Ridge Field as those formations with the highest opportunities for success. In 2001, no wells were drilled. Management plans to drill up to 6 horizontal re-entries during 2002 primarily to exploit these two reservoirs plus explore the Monterey Zone.
Richfield East Dome Unit. The Richfield East Dome Unit is a mature waterflood in Orange County, California, operated by GREKA's subsidiary and producing 684 BOPD. The field has proved net reserves of 2.4 MMBO valued at PV-10 $6.2 million or 17.7% of the Company's total reserve value. In September 2001, we increased our working interest in this field to 99% and net revenue interest to 77%. (see Item 1 - "Description of Business, Acquisition Activities, California E&P Assets") Waterflood operations were initiated in 1974 by Texaco. Field facilities are in sufficiently satisfactory condition to service the waterflood operation through the remaining life of the field. During second quarter 2002, we plan to sell GREKA's interests in this asset.
North Belridge Field. The North Belridge Field is located in Kern County, California. GREKA's subsidiary is the operator and owns 100% working interest in 42 wells on three leases covering 270 contiguous acres. The wells produce from two formations-- light oil from the Diatomite zone and heavy oil from the Tulare formation. Current production is about 278 BOEPD, net proved reserves are 1.5 MMBOE valued at PV-10 $6.2 million.
Louisiana
Potash Dome Field. The Potash Dome Field is located in Plaquemines Parish south of New Orleans, Louisiana, overlying a salt dome. The wells on the west side of the field are land based while the wells on the east side produce from single well structures located in shallow inland water. GREKA's subsidiary operates the 3000 acre field and has 100% working interest in 21 wells. Proved net reserves in the field are 1.6 MMBO and 14 BCFG valued at PV-10 $30.1 million. There exists substantial drilling opportunities in the field with net proved undeveloped reserves of 0.6 MMBO and 8.2 BCFG in seven drilling locations as determined by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., GREKA's independent petroleum engineers. During 2001, as the first of a four-phased program in the 2001 business plan, we successfully executed our initial five-well recompletion program, namely: Orleans Levee Board ("OLB") #77, #94, B-10, #90, #77, and SL508 #25. During the second phase of our program, also in 2001 we drilled to a total depth of 10,604' and dually completed in the 11-B gas sand and the 9-A oil sand our first well, Haspel & Davis No. 1, in the 9-A zone. Initial production from this well was at over 6 MMCF per day and current production is at 510 BOEPD (or 60 BOPD and 2.7 MMCFD). The well, which was directionally drilled beneath a large salt overhand in inland waters utilizing The Parker Drilling Co. rig #8B 1000 HP barge, was set to TD with 7 5/8" of production casing. This success proved the technical interpretation by GREKA of the potential reservoirs in this field. With our completion of the HD No. 1 well, the field has a total of 96 wells drilled to depths varying from 600' to 14,000' with 21 wells remaining. Additionally, GREKA believes there is substantial opportunity to add gas reserves in a deeper zone called the Tex "W" which is owned 50% by GREKA's subsidiary and 50% by Exxon-Mobil. During second quarter 2002, we plan to sell GREKA's interests in this asset.
Manila Village Field. The Manila Village Field is located in Jefferson Parish, south Louisiana. There are net proved reserves of 0.1 MBO in this field as of December 31, 2001. In April 2002, we sold our interest in this field.
Other United States
Southwest Tatum Field. The Southwest Tatum Field operated by GREKA's subsidiary is located in Lea County, New Mexico. This field was discovered in 1996 through the use of 3-D seismic. There are four different productive horizons in the field, Devonian, Canyon, Cisco, and Wolfcamp. There are net proved developed reserves of 0.1 MBO and 0.1 MMCFG in the field as of December 31, 2001.
San Simon Field. The San Simon Field is located in Lea County, New Mexico. In 2001, GREKA's subsidiary operated one oil well and three gas wells. The oil well is the only producer in the field completed in the Wolfcamp formation. This property was sold as of December 31, 2001.
Oil and Gas Reserves
Our proved reserves and the estimated present value of future revenues from proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties in this document have been estimated by our independent petroleum engineers. In 1999, 2000 and 2001, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. prepared reports on GREKA's reserves in the United States. The estimates of these independent petroleum engineers were based upon review of production histories and other geological, economic, ownership and engineering data provided by GREKA. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, GREKA's estimates of future net revenues from GREKA's proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of gas contracts, the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalation. Future gross revenues at December 31, 2001 reflect weighted average prices of $14.53 per BOE compared to $26.93 per BOE and $17.90 per BOE as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The following tables present total estimated proved developed producing, proved developed non-producing and proved undeveloped reserve volumes as of December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and the estimated present value of future net revenues ("PV-10") (based on current prices and costs at the respective year's end, using a discount factor of 10 percent per annum). As used herein, the term "proved undeveloped reserves" are those which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage is limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. We do not include estimates for proved undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir. There can be no assurance that these estimates are accurate predictions of reserves or of future net revenues from oil and gas reserves or their present value. The prices received for oil and gas have generally increased since the preparation of the 2001 year end engineering estimates.

Estimates of proved reserves may vary from year to year reflecting changes in the price of oil and gas and results of drilling activities during the
intervening period. Reserves previously classified as proved undeveloped may be completely removed from the proved reserves classification in a subsequent year as a consequence of negative results from additional drilling or product price declines which make such undeveloped reserves non-economic to develop. Conversely, successful development and/or increases in product prices may result in additions to proved undeveloped reserves.

As used herein, the terms "proved oil and gas reserves," "proved developed oil and gas reserves," and "proved undeveloped reserves" have the meanings defined by the SEC as set forth in the Table of Contents to this document. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating the sizes of underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserve reports of other engineers might differ from the reports contained herein. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Future prices received for the sale of oil and gas may be different from those used in preparing these reports. The amounts and timing of future operating and development costs may also differ from those used. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
The following table summarizes sales volume, sales price and production cost information for GREKA's net oil and gas production for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001.

- ---------- (1) A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned.
(2) A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interest in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
(3) A dry hole is an exploratory or development well that is not a producing well.
Productive Oil and Gas Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2001, relating to the number of productive oil and gas wells (producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells that are shut in) in which GREKA through its subsidiaries owned a working interest:

(1) Developed acreage is acreage assigned to productive wells.
Title to Properties
Many of GREKA's subsidiaries' oil and gas properties are held in the form of mineral leases, licenses, reservations, concession agreements and similar agreements. In general, these agreements do not convey a fee simple title to GREKA, but rather, depending upon the jurisdiction in which the pertinent property is situated, create lesser interests, varying from a profit a prendre to a determinable interest in the minerals. In some jurisdictions, notably non-U.S. jurisdictions, GREKA's subsidiaries' interest is only a contractual relationship and bestows no interest in the oil or gas in place. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. Title investigations are generally completed, however, before commencement of drilling operations or the acquisition of producing properties. GREKA believes that its methods of investigating title to, and acquisition of, its oil and gas properties are consistent with practices customary in the industry and that it has generally satisfactory title to the leases covering its proved reserves. Because most of GREKA's oil and gas leases require continuous production beyond the primary term, it is always possible that a cessation of producing or operating activities could result in the loss of a lease. Assignments of interest to and/or from GREKA'S subsidiaries may not be publicly recorded.
From time to time, substantially all of GREKA's properties, including its stock in its subsidiaries, are hypothecated to secure GREKA's current and future indebtedness. GREKA's subsidiaries' working interest in properties may be subject to lienholders by non-payment. In the event of GREKA's non-payment or untimely payment of its obligations, GREKA expects liens to be filed against its assets and to be subject to lawsuits. Oil and gas leases in which GREKA'S subsidiaries have an interest may be deficient, require ratifications and be subject to action by GREKA subsidiaries.
Average Sales Price and Production Cost
The following table sets forth information concerning average per unit sales price and production cost for GREKA's oil and gas production for the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31, ------------------------ 1999 2000 2001 ------ ------ ------
Average sales price per BOE: Integrated Ops .................... $10.82 $18.63 $16.82 E&P Americas ...................... 17.14 25.27 21.77 Combined .......................... 13.86 22.14 19.51

Asphalt Refinery
GREKA owns an asphalt refinery in Santa Barbara County, California through a wholly owned subsidiary. The refinery is a fully self-contained plant with steam generation, mechanical shops, control rooms, office, laboratory, emulsion plant and related facilities, and is staffed with a total of 21 operating, maintenance, laboratory and administrative personnel.
Real Estate Activities
GREKA'S subsidiaries from time to time purchased real estate in conjunction with their acquisition of oil and gas and refining properties in
California and plan to continue this practice. At December 31, 2001, the Company owned through its subsidiaries approximately 2,500 acres in Santa Barbara County, California and approximately 6 acres in Orange County, California. GREKA has used a portion of its real estate holdings for agricultural purposes. GREKA plans to retain some of these real estate holdings for asset appreciation which may include developmental activities at a future date.
Limestone Properties
GREKA owns a non-core, 355 acre limestone property located in Monroe County, Indiana. The limestone deposits are made up of Salem limestone, which produces a high industrial grade calcium oxide or calcium carbonate used in scrubbing machinery that cleans the gaseous emissions from coal burning generators. The Company is pursuing the sale of GREKA's interests in this asset.
In 1999, GREKA sold its interest in the limestone property in exchange for a $5.7 million non-recourse promissory note, secured by the limestone property. The buyer defaulted on the note, and the parties litigated their claims for which the court in May 2001 ordered in favor of GREKA and the property was reconveyed to GREKA.
Offices
GREKA leases approximately 1,000 square feet of office space at 630 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1501, New York, New York, for its executive offices through September 30, 2004. GREKA's offices are located in Santa Maria, California; Houston, Texas; and Beijing, China. In March 2002, GREKA announced that, due to the divestiture of related assets, it closed its international offices in Jakarta, Indonesia and Bogota, Colombia and will be downsizing its E&P Americas unit in Houston to a satellite office.
