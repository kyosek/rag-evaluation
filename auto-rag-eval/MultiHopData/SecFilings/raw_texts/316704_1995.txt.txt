ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. - ------- ----------- (a) Office Facilities. The Company's offices are located at 1536 Cole Boulevard, Suite 325, Golden, Colorado 80401. The Company pays $1,240.00 monthly rental for the use of office facilities. The Company believes that its present offices are suitable and adequate for its present operations.
(b)(1) Reserves. Proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves of the Company at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 were computed by Joseph R. Albi, Jr., a consulting petroleum engineer and former Executive Vice President of the Company, and were audited by Donald M. Osmus, a consulting Petroleum Engineer. Proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves of the Company at December 31, 1993 were computed by the Company and audited by Donald M. Osmus.
All of the Company's reserves are located in the continental United States and the majority of the properties comprising these reserves are operated by Black Dome Energy Corporation.
(1) Proved Developed Reserves. These are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. This classification includes:
(i) Proved Developed Producing Reserves. These are proved developed reserves which are expected to be produced from existing completion interval(s) now open for production in existing wells; and
(ii) Proved Developed Non-Producing Reserves. These are proved developed reserves which exist behind the casing of existing wells, or at minor depths below the present bottom of such wells, which are expected to be produced through these wells in the predictable future, where the cost of making such oil and gas available for production should be relatively small compared to the cost of a new well.
Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as "Proved Developed Reserves" only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved.
(2) Proved Undeveloped Reserves. These are proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units, which are reasonably certain of production when demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves may be attributable to acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is used or contemplated only where such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues from Proved Developed and Proved Undeveloped Oil and Gas Reserves. The table below presents, as of the end of 1995, 1994 and 1993, the present value of the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves discounted at an annual rate of ten percent (10%) per year.
While it is reasonable to anticipate that the prices received from the future sale of production may be higher or lower than the prices used in the evaluation described above, and the operating and other costs relating to such production may increase above existing levels, such increases in prices and costs have been omitted from consideration in making these evaluations in accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates and rates of production are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and non-producing and/or undeveloped reserves are more imprecise than those of mature producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, the estimates are subject to change as further information becomes available.
For additional information concerning oil and gas revenues, see Note 6 to the Financial Statements.
(b)(2) Reserves Reported to Other Agencies. The Company did not file any oil or gas reserve estimates with, or include such estimates in reports to, any other federal governmental authority or agency within its last fiscal year.
(b)(3)(i) Production. The following table shows the Company's net quantities of oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and of gas produced for each of the Company's past three fiscal years:
The Company has no long-term supply or similar arrangements with foreign governments or authorities.
(b)(3)(ii) Average Sales Price and Production Costs. The average sales prices (including transfers) and production costs per barrel of oil and Mcf of gas received by the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, were as follows. Equivalent barrels of production were calculated on the basis of 6 Mcf equals 1 Barrel.
(b)(4) Productive Wells and Acreage. The following tables set forth the Company's: (i) total gross and net productive oil and gas wells, and (ii) total gross and net developed acreage, both as of December 31, 1995:
(i) Productive Oil and Gas Wells. As of December 31, 1995, the Company owned an interest in 21 oil and/or gas properties, 18 of which are operated by the Company. The following depicts the number of gross and net oil and gas wells producing or capable of production in which the Company owned an interest at the end of the last fiscal period.
The above numbers reflect a reduction of two (2) gross wells (1.73 net wells) which were plugged and abandoned in 1995.
(*) A "gross well or acre" is a well or acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells or acres is the total number of wells or acres in which a working interest is owned.
(**) A "net well or acre" exists when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net wells or acres is the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres, expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
(ii) Developed Acreage. The following depicts the number of gross and net developed acres in which the Company owned an interest at the end of the Company's last fiscal year.
(b)(5) Undeveloped Acreage. The following table sets forth information regarding undeveloped acreage in which the Company has an interest.
As of the date of this filing, the Company's total undeveloped acreage is held by production and is not subject to expiration until the producing well or wells which it holds is/are non-commercial or plugged and abandoned. (b)(6) Drilling Activity. The following summarizes the drilling activity of the Company during each of the last three fiscal years.
* Earnings per share are restated to reflect the 1 for 1001 reverse stock split approved by shareholders on September 2, 1994.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ------------------------------------------------------------ Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working capital (which incorporates current and deferred obligations) increased slightly by $2,137 during the year ended December 31, 1995. These results followed a working capital increase of $84,031 in 1994. Lower received natural gas prices, payment of a portion of the deferred compensation, declining production without reserve replacement and significant depreciable and depletable costs resulted in the Company's loss of $210,598 or $2.86/share in 1995. Low natural gas prices, payment of a portion of the deferred compensation, unsuccessful workover costs of two wells in Oklahoma, and the costs associated with restructuring the Company contributed to the loss of $44,498 or $0.61 per share in 1994.
In October, 1992, as a source for additional working capital, the Company obtained a $300,000 line of credit with a lending institution, secured with 10 producing natural gas wells in Clark County, Kansas. As of December 31, 1994, a total of $132,724 was borrowed from the line of credit. During 1995, the Company reconstructed the debt obligations associated with the outstanding balance of the line of credit. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had bank debt obligations of $84,987 tied to an 8.5% note which matures on March 31, 1997. In addition, the Company holds a $150,000 line of credit secured with eight (8) Clark County, Kansas producing gas properties against which no sums were borrowed as of December 31, 1995.
The Company currently has no commitments for capital expenditures. The Company is utilizing its own cash resources as well as outside capital to attempt to purchase additional producing oil and gas properties. In general, the Company's financial condition will not permit the risk of exploratory or development drilling activities unless outside risk capital is obtained.
Results of Operations - --------------------- During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, oil and gas revenues decreased by $189,886 or 32% as compared to fiscal 1994, primarily as a result of lower received natural gas prices, decreases in Company net oil and gas production without reserve replacement and the sale of five (5) properties in 1994. At December 31, 1995, twenty-one wells were producing to contribute to this income. Management expects normal production decline from the presently producing wells during 1996. At December 31, 1995, the Company was operating eighteen wells as opposed to nineteen producing wells at December 31, 1994. Current markets remain unstable and it is impossible to predict how these will function. Any price increase or decrease will have a direct effect on the Company.
The Company experienced a net loss of $210,598 or $2.86/share during 1995 compared to a net loss of $44,498 or $.61/share during 1994. The decrease in earnings is a direct result of significant operational/rework expenses associated with properties, significantly lower received natural gas prices, and declining production without reserve replacement.
Interest income has decreased in the past few years both because of smaller amounts of invested cash and lower interest rates.
General and administrative costs decreased from $266,603 in 1994 to $237,918 in 1995, primarily as a result of the elimination of one full time salaried employee during 1994. However, overall general and administrative costs remain high relative to the Company's size. Management believes general and administrative costs cannot be reduced below current levels while prudently managing the Company's assets.
Oil and gas production costs have decreased to $190,795 in 1995 as compared to $300,236 in 1994. Both 1995 and 1994 oil and gas production costs reflect the additional operational and re-work costs associated with acquired properties.
The acquisition of producing gas properties in 1991, 1992 and 1993 significantly increased Black Dome's reserves during those three years. During 1994, the Company focused on re-working operations to improve and maintain production from all properties while recovering costs associated with the acquisitions. During 1994, the Company disposed of five (5) producing properties. During 1995, two (2) gas wells (1.73 net wells) in which the Company held an interest were plugged and abandoned. The Company was not successful in adding reserves through drilling or acquisition activity during 1995.
As a result of significant production decline and the Company's unsuccessful drilling and acquisition activity, net proved remaining reserves decreased significantly (26% on a Bbl equivalency basis) between December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994. The estimated SEC net present value of total proved reserves decreased from $1,281,621 at December 31, 1994 to $1,196,316 at December 31, 1995. Higher 1995 received year-end oil and gas prices cushioned the impact of lower 1995 reserve levels on the estimated SEC net present value of total proved reserves.
All of the foregoing conditions are expected to have a material adverse impact on the future operations of the Company. The Company's revenues are currently expected to continuously decrease during the next fiscal year as properties are sold to pay expenses, and as the remaining producing properties suffer normal declines in production. The Company does not currently have sufficient financial resources to purchase new producing properties to replenish expected production declines, or to replace properties that have been (and in all likelihood will continue to be) sold to pay operating expenses. Expenses of operations are not expected to decrease during the next fiscal year.
During fiscal 1996, the Company intends to continue to explore reasonable avenues relative to preserving and maximizing shareholder value. The recurring losses from operations sustained by the Company (primarily as the result of declining reserves, poor natural gas prices, inadequate reserve replacement and relatively high fixed costs associated with maintaining operations) raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. One of the avenues that management currently intends to explore is the voluntary liquidation of the Company during the next twelve months. In the event that the Company is unable to receive significant funding from some viable outside source or does not voluntarily liquidate substantially all of its assets during the next twelve months, it currently appears to be likely that the Company will continue to deplete its assets in order to meet its ongoing operating expenses (which will ultimately result in little or nothing being available for distribution to any of the Company's shareholders upon its eventual liquidation.)
Under Colorado law the Company is not permitted to sell substantially all of its assets without first obtaining approval from a majority of its shareholders. The cost of holding such a shareholders' meeting (including printing, mailing, legal and accounting expenses) is currently estimated to be approximately $40,000. These costs will reduce the amount that would otherwise have been available for distribution to shareholders upon liquidation.
Changes in Prices, Costs and Impact of Inflation - ------------------------------------------------ Current economic trends still indicate that costs of conducting business activities will not rise as rapidly as they have during the preceding inflationary years.
Governmental and foreign decisions over which Management has no control could impact the prices received for the Company's oil and gas and could have a very serious effect on profits. It is impossible to predict long term or even short term trends in pricing.
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. - ------- --------------------------------------------
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS --------------------------------------------------
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Black Dome Energy Corporation Evergreen, Colorado
We have audited the balance sheet of Black Dome Energy Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Black Dome Energy Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1995, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for depreciation of lease and well equipment from the straight line method to the unit of production method and the financial statements have been restated to reflect the change.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: ------------------------------------------- Operations of the company ------------------------- Black Dome Energy Corporation was incorporated as a Colorado corporation on December 12, 1979 and was in the development stage through 1980. The Company is involved in exploration for oil and gas and the acquisition, development, and operation of oil and gas leasehold interests.
Property and equipment and depreciation, depletion, and amortization -------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company follows the successful-efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development costs. Under this method, lease acquisition costs and exploration and development costs attributable to the finding and development of proved reserves are capitalized. Exploratory dry hole costs and other nonproductive oil and gas activities are expensed. Costs of nonproductive leases are charged to expense when abandoned or substantially impaired, based upon a property-by-property evaluation. Capitalized costs relating to producing properties are depleted or depreciated on the units-of- production method based on the total of proved reserves. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance costs and delay rentals are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulate depreciation, depletion, or amortization of property sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts; and gains or losses on dispositions are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Furniture, office equipment, and an automobile are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company had previously used the straight line method of depreciation for lease and well equipment, and in 1995, changed to the units-of-production method. The change resulted in additional depreciation of $56,525 ($.77 per share) in 1995; $26,999 ($.37 per share) in 1994; $55,628 ($.76 per share) in 1993; and $26,302 in prior years. The Company's financial statements have been restated to reflect the changes. The Company believes that this better reports income to conform to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Accounting Standards No. 121.
Inventory --------- Inventory of lease and well equipment is valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by either the specific identification method or average cost method depending on the nature of the inventory item.
Income taxes ------------ The Company accounts for income taxes using tax-liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109. The effect of Statement 109 will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company. The benefit of tax carryforwards has not been recognized because realization is not assured.
Gain (loss) per share --------------------- Gain (loss) per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year.* There were 73,755 shares outstanding at December 31,1995 and 73,455 at December 31, 1994.
* after allowing for the one-for 1,001 reverse split during in 1994.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: ------------------------------------------- Basis of presentation and going concern --------------------------------------- The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and to increase sales to a level where the Company becomes profitable. The Company's management believes it will be able to attain these goals.
2. Oil and Gas Operations: ----------------------- Information related to the Company's oil and gas operations is summarized as follows:
3. Income Taxes: ------------- At December 31, 1995, net operating losses available for federal income tax purposes total approximately $1,250,000, of which $189,000, $187,000, $237,000, $151,000, $250,000, $36,000 and $200,000 will expire in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007 respectively. Investment tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 1995, total $13,800 of which, $8,900, $2,000, $2,800, and $100 will expire in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively, if not utilized.

4. Employment Contracts: -------------------- On May 8, 1991, the Company entered into an employment contract with E.J. Huff as President of Black Dome for a four-year period beginning January 1, 1991 and ending December 31, 1994. The contract provides for annual compensation of $9,600 paid currently and $60,000 to be deferred to the final year of the contract. At December 31, 1994, $240,000 for the first four years of deferred compensation had been recognized by the Company and payment of $140,000 had been made. The deferred compensation is unfunded. During 1993 and 1994 in lieu of his $9,600 annual compensation and with approval of the Board of Directors, Mr. Huff accepted 6,800,000 and 7,500,00 restricted (pre reverse split) shares of the Company's no par value common stock and cash compensation of $1,100. On December 31, 1994, the Company entered into an employment contract with E.J. Huff as President of Black Dome for the three years ending December 31, 1997 with annual compensation of $100,000 for 1995; $125,000 for 1996 and $150,000 for 1997. On July 1, 1991, the Company entered into an employment contract with J.R. Albi, Jr., as Executive Vice President of Black Dome for a three-year period beginning July 1, 1991 and ending June 30, 1994. The contract provides for annual compensation of $60,000. Upon execution of the agreement, Mr. Albi received 7,256,000 pre-split shares of the Company's common stock valued at $.00125 per share or $9,070. The shares were restricted for the term of the contract and were forfeitable as follows: If Mr. Albi left the employ of the Company prior to June 30, 1992, all of the shares; prior to June 30, 1993, two-thirds of the shares; and prior to June 30, 1994, one-third of the shares. The contract has been fulfilled.
5. Major Customers: --------------- During the year ended December 31, 1995 sales of oil and gas to two customers totaled approximately $295,000 and $52,000. During the year ended December 31, 1994, sales of oil and gas to two major customers were $336,000 and $154,000. During the year ended December 31, 1993, sales of oil and gas to two customers totaled approximately $132,000 and $242,000.

6. Supplementary Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited), Continued: ------------------------------------------------------------- Summary of oil and gas producing activities on the basis of reserve recognition accounting:
The following accounting policies have been used in preparing the Reserve Recognition Accounting (RRA) presentation. The summary of oil and gas producing activities on the basis of RRA was prepared based on the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under RRA, earnings are recognized as proved reserves are found based on the estimated present value of such reserves, computed as described below. Subsequent revisions to the RRA valuation of proved reserves are included in earnings as they occur. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which can be expected, with little doubt, to be recoverable commercially at current prices and costs under existing operating methods. The proved reserves and related valuations were computed by J.R. Albi, Jr. and audited by Donald M. Osmus, independent petroleum consulting individual, in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Estimated future net revenues were computed by applying current prices received by the Company to estimated future production of reserves, less estimated future development and production costs and windfall profit taxes based on current costs. A discount factor of 10% was applied to the estimated future revenues to compute the estimated present value of proved oil and gas reserves. This valuation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value of the Company's oil and gas properties.

6. Supplementary Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited), Continued: ------------------------------------------------------------- Totals of proved reserves are inherently imprecise estimates and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes, and other factors. The pretax income (loss) reflected in the primary financial statements for oil and gas producing activities corresponds to the pretax income (loss) on the basis of RRA of $128,323 in 1995 and $(1,202,954) in 1994 and $1,053,577 in 1993, respectively. "Additions to reserves" are the result of current acquisitions and development activities. Increases in prices are the approximate effect on the RRA valuation of proved reserves due to price changes. Other revisions represent the net effect of all revisions to estimated quantities of proved reserves. Accretion of discount was computed by multiplying 10% times the present value of future net revenues as of the beginning of the year, adjusted to reflect downward revisions. Evaluated acquisition, exploration, development, and production costs include current and estimated future costs associated with the current year reserve additions. Such expenses include property acquisitions, well costs, lease rentals, and abandonments. The cost of acquiring unproved properties and drilling exploratory wells are deferred until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive, at which time they are charged to expense. There were no deferred acquisition and exploration costs at December 31, 1995 and 1994. The provision for income taxes is based on the "liability" method computed by applying the current statutory income tax rate to the difference between the year end RRA valuation of proved reserves and the tax basis in the properties less estimated investment tax credits and statutory depletion associated with future development costs.
7. Commitments and Contingencies: ------------------------------ There were no commitments or contingencies known to management at December 31, 1995.
8. Related Party Transactions: --------------------------- On January 27, 1992, the Company issued its one-year note for $35,000 to Clayton Corporation, a company controlled by E.J. Huff, with interest at 8% per annum. On January 27, 1993, the not was renewed and interest paid by issuance of a note for $2,800. On January 27, 1994, an additional note for $2,800 was issued for interest which was included in accrued interest at December 31, 1993. The notes were paid in full in 1994.
9. Environmental Liabilities: -------------------------- The company's oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding environmental and ecological matters. These laws and regulations, among other things, impose liability on the Company, as a lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages, require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas and impose restrictions on the injection of liquids into subsurface aquifers that may contain groundwater. As of December 31, 1995, the Company was not aware of any environmental claims which would have a material impact upon the Company's financial position or results of operations.

10. Reverse stock split and Treasury Stock -------------------------------------- During 1994, the Company effected a reverse stock split pursuant to which one new share of the Company's Common Stock was issued in exchange for each 1,001 shares of the Company's previously outstanding Common Stock. To the extent that such reverse stock split resulted in any shareholder owning less than a single full share of the Company's common stock, the Company paid cash for each such fractional share in an amount equal to the appropriate fraction of $5.90 per whole share (which represents the fair value of a whole share after the consummation of the proposed reverse stock split as determined by the Company's Board of Directors). To the extent that the proposed reverse stock split resulted in fractional shares held by persons who owned one or more full shares of the Company's common stock after consummation of the reverse stock split, such fractional shares were rounded up or down to the nearest full share.
ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. ------------------------------------------------------------ None applicable.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. - -------- ----------------------- Executive Compensation - ---------------------- The following tabular information includes all plan and non-plan compensation paid to the Company's president and all other executive officers whose total annual salary and bonus is $100,000 or more for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 1995:
* See Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements (Page 33).
(1) On May 11, 1991, the Company entered into a four-year Employment Contract with Mr. Edgar J. Huff, which provides for deferred compensation of $60,000 per year to be payable in July 1994 ($180,000). In July 1994, $140,000 of the $180,000 deferred compensation was paid and $40,000 of the $180,000 compensation was further deferred until 1995. The
$60,000 deferred salary for 1994, and the $9,600 bonus for 1994 due to be paid in January 1995 have been further deferred, and are carried on the books of the Corporation as a liability.
(2) Mr. Huff's Employment Contract dated May 11, 1991, also provides for the payment of an annual bonus in the amount of $9,600. Mr. Huff's 1993 earned bonus of $9,600 was not paid as of December 31, 1993, however it was paid during fiscal year 1994. During fiscal 1994, Mr. Huff received the 1993 earned bonus which was paid in stock and cash. The earned bonus of $9,600 for 1994 due in January 1995 has been further deferred.
(3) In 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 7,500,000 shares of no par value restricted common stock, plus a cash payment of $225.00 to Mr. Huff as payment of the contractual bonus of $9,600 earned by Mr. Huff for the calendar year 1993. The Board of Directors determined the price of $0.00125 per share to be a fair and reasonable value to the Company for such shares when considering, among other things, the current net tangible book value of the Company's assets, its existing debt obligations, the current lack of any existing trading market for the Company's shares, the absence of any market makers for the Company's shares, the lack of any ascertainable market value for the Company's common stock, and the restricted nature of the shares to be issued.
(4) On July 1, 1991, the Company entered into a three-year Employment Contract with Mr. Joseph R. Albi, Jr. which provides for annual compensation of $60,000 per year ($5,000/month) and the issuance of 7,256,000 shares of the restricted no par value Common Stock of the Company valued at $.00125 per share or $9,070. The shares were restricted for the term of Mr. Albi's contract which began on July 1, 1991 and ended on June 30, 1994 and were forfeitable as follows: If Mr. Albi left the employ of the Company prior to June 30, 1992, all of the shares would be forfeited; prior to June 30, 1993, two-thirds of the shares would be forfeited; and prior to June 30, 1994, one-third of the shares would be forfeited. Mr. Albi left the employ of the Company on June 30, 1994 and became vested in the entire 7,256,000 shares of restricted no par value common stock of the Company.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS - AWARDS IN LAST FISCAL YEAR
On May 1, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an IRS approved (Model Form 5035-A) Salary Deferred Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SAR-SEP) allowing eligible salaried employees to contribute (through elective deferrals) a portion of their salary on a before tax basis to individual IRA accounts set up on behalf of the Company. Should employee contributions be such that the Plan is deemed "top-heavy" for any Plan year (as defined by the IRS), the Company will be required to contribute an amount to non-key employees (not to exceed 3% of their annual compensation) for that plan year. During fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, the Company contributed $666 to the IRA accounts of non-key employees to satisfy "top- heavy" Plan requirements for the year 1995.

Premiums are to be paid by the Company and such sum shall be payable to the Company in the event of Mr. Huff's demise during the term of the Employment Agreement. The Employment Agreement further provides that, should there not be sufficient cash each year as provided in the agreement so that the lump sum is not available, then Mr. Huff may be paid with any class of the Company's stock as may be mutually agreed between Mr. Huff and the Company; provided, however, that there shall be deducted from all compensation paid to Mr. Huff, such sums, including, but without limitation to, social security, income tax withholding and unemployment insurance, as the Company is by law obligated to do.
The Employment Agreement may be mutually terminated prior to the maximum period of three (3) years whereupon Mr. Huff shall be entitled to all current and deferred compensation earned by him to the date of termination.
The Company has no compensatory plan or arrangement, including payments to be received from the Company, with respect to any individual named above for the latest or the next preceding fiscal year, if such plan or arrangement results or will result from the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such individual's employment with the Company, or from a change in control of the Company or a change in the individual's responsibilities following a change in control.
