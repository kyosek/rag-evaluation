ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 59 Malls and non-controlling interests in 8 Malls as of December 31, 2018. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more anchors or junior anchors and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor and junior anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo was classified as a Non-stabilized Mall as of December 31, 2018. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2017.
(3)
Excluded Malls - We exclude Malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded:
a.
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the Property or convey the secured Property to the lender. Acadiana Mall, Cary Towne Center and Triangle Town Center were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, Acadiana Mall was returned to the lender and Cary Towne Center was sold. Acadiana Mall was also classified as a Lender Mall as of December 31, 2017. Lender Malls are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers.
b.
Repositioning Malls - Malls that are currently being repositioned or where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property. This may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, we may determine that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. The steps taken to reposition these Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not
included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Repositioning Malls. Hickory Point Mall was classified as a Repositioning Mall as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Cary Towne Center was classified as a Repositioning Mall as of December 31, 2017 until its reclassification as a Lender Mall in 2018.
c.
Minority Interest Malls - Malls in which we have a 25% or less ownership interest. Triangle Town Center was classified in the Minority Interest Mall category as of December 31, 2017 until its reclassification as a Lender Mall in 2018. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this unconsolidated affiliate.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Brookfield Square, Cross Creek Mall, Dakota Square Mall, EastGate Mall, Meridian Mall, St. Clair Square, Stroud Mall and WestGate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.

Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 5,510 Mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 71.1% of the occupied Mall store GLA. Although Mall stores occupy only 34.3% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 65.7% is occupied by Anchors and Junior Anchors and a small percentage is vacant), the Malls received 84.3% of their total revenues from Mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2018:
(1)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable common area expenses and real estate taxes, in effect at December 31, 2018 for expiring leases that were executed as of December 31, 2018.
(2)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable CAM expenses and real estate taxes, of expiring leases as a percentage of the total annualized gross rent of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2018.

See page 59 for a comparison between rents on leases that expired in the current reporting period compared to rents on new and renewal leases executed in 2018. For comparable spaces under 10,000-square-feet, we leased approximately 2.3 million square feet with stabilized mall leasing spreads averaging a decline of 10.8%, including declines on new leases of 1.7% and renewal spreads declining an average of 12.5%. While we anticipate negative renewal spreads in the near term, we are optimistic that the 2018 positive sales trends will lead to improved lease negotiations in the future. Page 59 includes new and renewal leasing activity as of December 31, 2018 with commencement dates in 2018 and 2019.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by its sales. Mall store sales represent total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet.
The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total Mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for each of the past three years:

In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls. The information in this table is based on 100% of the applicable amounts and has not been adjusted for our ownership share.

Represents reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, CAM charges, marketing and certain capital expenditures.

Other Property Types
Other property types include the following three categories:

Anchor tenants typically include tenants such as T.J. Maxx, Target, Kohl’s and Bed Bath & Beyond. Associated Centers are managed by the staff at the Mall since it is adjacent to and usually benefits from the customers drawn to the Mall.
(2)
Community Centers - Designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.

Anchors and Junior Anchors
Anchors and Junior Anchors are an important factor in a Property’s successful performance. However, we believe that the number of traditional department store anchors will decline over time, providing us the opportunity to redevelop these spaces to attract new uses such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness centers and lifestyle retailers that engage consumers and encourage them to spend more time at our Properties. Anchors are generally a department store or, increasingly, other large format retailers, whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the Property's tenants.
Anchors and Junior Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to non-anchor tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors and Junior Anchors accounted for 15.7% of the total revenues from our Properties in 2018. Each Anchor and Junior Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2018, the following Anchors and Junior Anchors were added to our Properties, as listed below:
As of December 31, 2018, the Properties had a total of 492 Anchors and Junior Anchors, including 35 vacant Anchor and Junior Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors and Junior Anchors at our Excluded Malls.
