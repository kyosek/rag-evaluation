ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - ----------------------
The Partnership owns all of its properties through a joint venture (the "Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture") formed on March 1, 1988, between the Partnership and Wells Real Estate Fund II ("Well Fund II"). Wells Fund II is a Georgia public limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund II are substantially identical to those of the Partnership. As of December 31, 1998, the Partnership's equity interest in the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture was approximately 5% and the equity interest of Wells Fund II was approximately 95%.
The Partnership does not have control over the operations of the joint ventures; however, it does exercise significant influence. Accordingly, investment in joint ventures is recorded on the equity method.
Of the six properties owned by the joint venture, three are retail shopping centers, two are office buildings and one is a restaurant. As of December 31, 1998, these properties were 97% occupied, up from 96% at December 31, 1997, and from 64% at December 31, 1996.
The following table shows lease expirations during each of the next ten years for all leases as of December 31, 1998, assuming no exercise of renewal options or termination rights:
(1) Average monthly gross rent over the life of the lease, annualized.
(2) Expiration of First Union Bank with 70,752 square feet at the First Union project.
(3) Expiration of Boeing Company lease with 119,040 square feet at the Atrium.
The following describes the properties in which the Partnership owns an interest as of December 31, 1997:
The First Union Property/Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture - ---------------------------------------------------------
On May 9, 1988, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture acquired a two-story building containing approximately 70,752 net leasable square feet, located on a 9.54 acre tract of land located in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (the "First Union Property") for a purchase price of $8,550,000.
On May 1, 1994, First Union Bank assumed occupancy of the First Union Property under a lease which expires April 30, 2001. The principal terms of the lease provide for First Union's sole tenancy of the project as a regional operations center for the initial term of seven years. Because First Union Bank invested approximately $1 million on tenant improvements at the First Union Property, a lower rental rate was accepted for the first five years of the lease term.
The annual base rent during the initial term is $412,705 payable in equal monthly installments of $34,392.08 during the first two years, annual base rent of $454,651 payable in equal monthly installments of $37,887.58 during the third year, annual base rent of $489,650 payable in equal monthly installments of $40,804.17 during the fourth year and annual base rent of $524,625
payable in equal monthly installments of $43,718.75 during the fifth year. Rental rates during the remaining two years of the lease term will be determined by market rates.
The occupancy rates at the Charlotte Property as of December 31 were 100% in 1998 1997, and 1996.
The average effective annual rental per square foot at the First Union Property was $6.49 for 1998 and 1997, $6.51 for 1996, $5.83 for 1995, $3.88 for 1994, and $28.12 for 1993. The higher effective annual rental rate for 1993 is due to the payment of $425,000 in lease termination fees by IBM.
The Atrium/Fund II - Fund III Joint Venture - -------------------------------------------
On April 3, 1989, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture formed a joint venture (the "Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture") with Wells Real Estate Fund III, L.P. ("Wells Fund III"), a public Georgia limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund III are substantially identical to those of the Partnership.
In April 1989, the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture acquired a four-story office building located on a 5.6 acre tract of land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center in metropolitan Houston, in the City of Nassau Bay, Harris County, Texas, know as "The Atrium at Nassau Bay" (the "Atrium").
The funds used by the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture to acquire the Atrium were derived from capital contributions made to the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture by the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund III in the amounts of $8,327,856 and $2,538,000, respectively, for total initial capital contributions of $10,865,856. As of December 31, 1997, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund III had made total capital contributions to the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture of approximately $8,330,000 and $4,448,000, respectively, for the acquisition and development of the Atrium.
The Atrium was first occupied in 1987 and contains approximately 119,000 net leasable square feet. Each floor of the Atrium was originally under a separate lease to Lockheed Engineering and Science Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lockheed Company, each of which leases had terms of approximately eight years and expired June 30, 1996, and upon which date Lockheed vacated the property.
On March 3, 1997, a lease was signed with The Boeing Company for the entire Atrium building. The lease is for a period of five years with an option to renew for an additional five year term. The rental rate for the first three years of the lease term is $12.25 per square foot and $12.50 per square foot for the final two years of initial lease term. The rate for the optional five year term will be determined based upon then current market rates. Upon 150 day prior written notice, Boeing has the right to cancel its lease in the event that NASA or another prime contractor were to cancel or substantially reduce its contract. In addition, there is a no-cause cancellation provision at the end of the first three year period. If this no-cause cancellation is exercised, Boeing would be required to
pay unamortized, up-front tenant improvement costs. The lease also provides that tenant will pay certain operating expenses in excess of $5.50 per square foot on an annual basis.
Boeing began the move-in phase of its occupancy on April 15, 1997, and occupied The Atrium and began paying rent on May 15, 1997. The total cost of completing the required tenant improvements and outside broker commissions of approximately $1.4 million was funded out of reserves and cash flows of the Partnership, Wells Fund II-OW and Wells Fund III. As of December 31, 1997, the Partnership had contributed approximately $21,744, Wells Fund II had contributed approximately $387,752, Wells Fund III had contributed approximately $659,810, and the Fund II Fund III Joint Venture had contributed $330,694 to fund the tenant improvements and outside broker commissions required. The ownership percentages in The Atrium have been adjusted as a result of these additional capital contributions, and as of December 31, 1998, the Fund II - Fund II-OW Joint Venture holds an equity interest in The Atrium of approximately 61%, and Wells Fund III holds an equity interest of approximately 39% in the project.
The Brookwood Grill Property/Fund II - Fund III Joint Venture - -------------------------------------------------------------

This Roswell site, which opened early in March 1992, is the second location in the Atlanta area for what is anticipated as a southeastern chain of restaurants similar in concept to Houston's, Ruby Tuesday, and Friday's. This chain is principally owned by David Rowe, an Atlanta real estate developer of Kroger shopping centers, and several operating partners formerly with Houston's. The terms of the lease call for an initial term of 9 years and 11 months, with two additional 10-year option periods. The agreement calls for a base rental of $217,006 per year for Years 1 through 5, with a 15% increase over the remainder of the initial term. Rental rates for all option periods will be based on the prevailing market values and rates for those periods. The Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture has expended approximately $1,100,000 for the development and construction of the restaurant building together with parking areas, driveways, landscaping and other improvements. In addition to the base rent described above, the tenant is required to pay "additional rent" in amounts equal to a 12% per annum return on all amounts expended for such improvements.
The occupancy rate for the Brookwood Grill, a sole tenant, was 100% for 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, and 1994. The average effective rental per square foot at the Brookwood Grill is $30.26 for 1998 and 1997, $30.29 for 1996, $30.21 for 1995, 1994 and 1993.

On January 1, 1991, the Cherokee Joint Venture, which is defined below, was merged into the Tucker Joint Venture forming a new joint venture (the "Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture"). As described below, the Cherokee Joint Venture was also a joint venture between the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture and Wells Fund I. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement of Fund I and Fund II Tucker- Cherokee, the percentage interest of the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture in the Tucker Project remained unchanged as a result of the merger of the Tucker Joint Venture into the Tucker-Cherokee Joint Venture.
