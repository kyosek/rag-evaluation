HYCROFT MINE
The Hycroft mine and related facilities are located 54 miles (86 kilometers) west of Winnemucca, Nevada. The mine is an open-pit, heap leaching operation that produces gold and by-product silver. The Lewis mine was originally a sulfur mine. In 1983, it commenced operation as a small heap-leach gold mine. The Corporation acquired the Lewis mine in early 1987 and completed construction of the
- 13 -
adjacent Crofoot mine project in April 1988. In early 1989, the two mines were consolidated into a single operation under an ore purchase agreement, with ore from both properties processed through the larger and more efficient Crofoot plant. Hycroft Inc. began stripping at the new Brimstone pit, located one mile to the east of the existing Central Fault pit, in April 1996 and commenced construction of a new 3 million-square-foot (280,000 square meter) leach pad and a 2,800 gallon-per-minute (10,598 liter-per-minute) leach solution processing plant in the summer of the same year. Ore from the Brimstone pit was hauled to the new leach pad beginning in September 1996 and the Brimstone plant commenced operation in February 1997. Mining operations at the Hycroft mine were suspended in December 1998.
Gold production continued in 1999, and is expected to continue in 2000, from gold contained in the heap leach pads. In 1999, the Hycroft mine produced 40,075 ounces of gold and 183,170 ounces of silver. Hycroft mine gold production for 2000 is estimated to be in excess of 12,000 ounces. The Corporation will continue to review the economic situation and gold resources to determine whether operations can be restarted. Reclamation will proceed in areas that will not be disturbed by future operations.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
The Crofoot and Lewis properties together comprise approximately 9,600 acres (3,885 hectares). The Crofoot property, originally held under two leases, covers approximately 3,600 acres (1,460 hectares). The Lewis property, which virtually surrounds the Crofoot property, is held through a lease that covers approximately 6,000 acres (2,430 hectares). The mine is accessible by road and has access to adequate supplies of water and power. The major mining facilities consist of mobile mining equipment, four leach pads, two Merrill-Crowe gold-silver recovery plants and associated maintenance and support facilities.
GEOLOGY AND HISTORY
The Hycroft mine is located on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains. The deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the Tertiary Kamma Mountain volcanics. The volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs, flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks. Fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia. Volcanic rocks have been block-faulted by dominant north-trending structures, which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization. The Central Fault and East Fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation. A post-mineral range-front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent Pleistocene Lahontan Lake sediments in the Black Rock Desert. The geological events have created a physical setting ideally suited to the open-pit, heap-leach mining operation at the Hycroft mine. The heap leach method is widely used in the southwestern United States and allows the economical treatment of oxidized low-grade ore deposits in large volumes.
The known gold mineralization within the Crofoot and Lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles (4.8 kilometers) in a north-south direction by 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) in an east-west direction. Mineralization extends to a depth of less than 330 feet (100 meters) in the outcropping to near-outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over 990 feet (300 meters) in the Brimstone deposit in the east. Not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization. The determination of whether mineralization can be mined economically is dependent on the grade of mineralization, the depth of overburden and the degree of oxidation.
In 1992, Hycroft Inc. exercised its options to convert its leasehold interests in the Crofoot property into a 100% ownership interest in the patented mining claims, a 100% possessory interest in the unpatented claims and a 100% interest in the incidental rights thereto, all subject to 4% net profits royalties and
- 14 -
excluding rights to sulfur. No royalty payments were made in 1995, 1994 and 1993 because minimum royalty payments made prior to 1993 aggregating $2.8 million were available for credit against the royalty obligations. The Crofoot lease/purchase agreement was amended in 1996 to provide for minimum advance royalty payments of $120,000 on January 1 of each year in which mining occurs. An additional $120,000 payment is due if ore production exceeds 5.0 million tons from the Crofoot property in any calendar year. All advance royalty payments are available as credit against the 4% net profits royalty. The aggregate acquisition cost to Hycroft Inc. was $6,881,481 and was financed by the issuance of Common Shares and the assumption of certain debts associated with the Lewis mine. The leasehold interest in the Lewis property extends until January 1, 2013 or for so long thereafter as Hycroft Lewis continues to conduct commercial mining operations on the property.
The Lewis lease provides for the payment to the lessor of a 5% net smelter return royalty on gold production. The royalty increases for ore grades above 0.05 ounce per ton and is offset by annual advance minimum royalties. The Corporation has the right to commingle the ore from the Lewis property with ore from the adjoining Crofoot property under an agreement with the lessor of the Lewis property.
The ore reserves mined in 1998 in the Brimstone deposit, which lies partially on the Crofoot property and partially on the Lewis property, were processed on both the Brimstone leach pad and the Crofoot leach pad. The allocation of metal produced from the commingled Crofoot and Lewis ores is calculated using methods consistent with industry standards. The same method will be employed during 2000 if gold mining is restarted.
MINING AND PROCESSING
During 1999, no ore was excavated at the Hycroft mine. Waste stripping was suspended in January 1998 and ore mining was suspended in December 1998.
Until November 1996, higher-grade ore was crushed prior to treatment on the leach pads. From November 1996 to December 1998, all ore was hauled directly to the leach pads without crushing. Dilute alkaline cyanide solution is pumped from a pond to the heap surface and distributed evenly over the crushed and run-of-mine ore through a network of pipes and irrigation sprinklers or drip emitters. The solution percolates down through the layers of ore, preferentially leaching gold and silver from the rock. This pregnant solution, containing dissolved gold and silver, flows along the surface of the impervious leach pad to a collection ditch from which it drains into one of two pregnant solution ponds. The low-grade solutions are recirculated to the heaps to increase the amount of gold in the solution, and the high-grade solution is pumped directly to the recovery plant where the gold and silver are extracted. The process is a zero-discharge closed circuit.
The Crofoot recovery plant can process up to 3,000 gallons-per-minute (11,355 liters-per-minute) of solution from leach pads 1, 2, 3 and 5 (18,000 tons of solution per day) and the Brimstone recovery plant can process up to 2,800 gallons-per-minute (10,600 liters-per-minute) of solution from the Brimstone leach pad (also referred to as pad 4). This process includes filtering to remove particulates, de-aeration to remove dissolved oxygen and introduction of small quantities of zinc dust. The dissolved gold and silver precipitate out of the solution onto the zinc particles which are then removed by a second stage of filtration. The barren solution is returned to the leaching circuit. The precipitate is treated to remove mercury, then mixed with fluxes and smelted to yield a dore bar. Dore bars are shipped offsite for refining and sale. Metalor USA Refining Corporation refines gold and silver production from the Hycroft mine. Alternate refiners are available if necessary.

ORE RESERVES
Gold production from the Brimstone deposit at the Hycroft mine consistently exceeded projections, and during 1999, the Corporation conducted a $0.6 million exploration program to determine the reasons for the excess gold production, and to re-estimate the grade and tons of the remaining reserves left in the Brimstone deposit after mining was suspended in December 1998. MRDI, an independent consultant was retained to assist with the evaluation and to provide an independent review of the recalculated mineable reserves. During the period 1996 through 1998, gold production from the north end of the Brimstone deposit exceeded planned production by 47,090 ounces, or 26%. The excess gold production was a result of mining 13% more ore tons at a 12% higher average grade than predicted in the exploration reserve model.
To evaluate the potential of a similar upgrading effect in the remaining Brimstone resource, nine diamond drill holes for a total of 4,870 feet (1,484 meters) and 11 reverse-circulation drill holes for a total of 5,540 feet (1,689 meters) were completed in the unmined southern portion of the Brimstone deposit. Seventeen of the 20 holes were twin holes, which were used to establish an upgrade factor for the remaining Brimstone resource. Working with MRDI engineers, a gold-grade enhancement of 25% was estimated.
An initial reserve evaluation prepared by the Corporation at a gold price of $275 per ounce resulted in proven and probable reserves estimated at 24.0 million tons (21.8 million tonnes) of ore grading 0.021 gold ounces per ton (0.72 grams per tonne), and containing 495,000 ounces of gold and 4.1 million ounces of silver. These reserve calculations have not been subject to independent verification; however, verification by a qualified person within the Corporation has been performed. These reserves have been estimated following the guidelines of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 under the direction of Qualified Person Warren Bates, International Exploration Manager.
OPERATING STATISTICS
Operating statistics for the Hycroft mine for the period 1995 to 1999 were as follows:
- ----------
(1) Ore processed means ore placed on pads but not necessarily leached during the year.
(2) Cash operating costs is composed of all direct mining expenses including inventory changes, refining and transportation costs, less by-product silver credits.
Gold production for 1999 was significantly down from 1998. The decreased gold production was due to the suspension of mining activities at the Hycroft mine in December 1998. All 1999 gold production was from ore that had been mined and inventoried in previous years.

MINE SITE EXPLORATION
At the Hycroft mine in Nevada, nine diamond drill holes for 4,870 feet (1,485 meters) and 11 reverse-circulation drill holes for 5,540 feet (1,690 meters) were completed in the unmined southern portion of the Brimstone deposit. Seventeen of the 20 holes were twin holes, which were used to establish an upgrade factor for the remaining Brimstone resource. The upgrade program was necessary in light of the fact that historical gold production from the Brimstone deposit was 26% greater than predicted from the 1995 ore reserves.
Over 525 reverse-circulation drill holes were re-logged in the Albert and Brimstone area, a new geologic model was built, and the current assay and geologic files were audited and re-entered into a new database.
In conjunction with MRDI, a gold grade enhancement of 25% was calculated. The new gold grades will be used to establish new mining reserves at current gold prices.
There is significant potential to extend the oxide mineralization to the south, along strike, at both the Central Fault and Brimstone deposits, but the greatest upside lies in the largely unexplored sulfide mineralization below the Brimstone deposit, as well as higher grade intercepts along the Central Fault.
Current resources at Brimstone are limited to the oxide cap of an apparently large but previously unexplored gold-bearing sulfide system. Two diamond drill holes, drilled in 1996 and earlier, have intercepted mineralized sulfides averaging 0.023 ounces per ton gold and 0.5 ounces per ton silver over intervals exceeding 500 feet (153 meters) in thickness. In 1996, the Corporation also intercepted 30 feet (nine meters) of gold mineralization in drill hole 95-2728. This intercept assayed 0.155 ounces per ton gold at a true depth of 310 feet (94 meters) below surface. The hole terminated in this mineralization, so the true width of the mineralization is unknown. Vista Gold intends to investigate these targets when market conditions improve.
MINERAL RIDGE MINE
SUMMARY
On October 21, 1998, the Corporation acquired the Mineral Ridge mine through the purchase of all of the shares of Mineral Ridge Inc. from Cornucopia Resources Ltd. ("Cornucopia") in consideration for 1,562,000 Common Shares of Vista Gold with an aggregate value of $250,000 and Vista Gold having subscribed on a private placement basis for 2,777,777 common shares of Cornucopia with an aggregate value of $250,000. As part of the transaction, Mineral Ridge Inc. amended an existing loan agreement with Dresdner Bank AG ("Dresdner Bank"). The amended agreement revised the terms of repayment of the previously outstanding loan and accrued interest totaling approximately $13.5 million and provided additional loans to Mineral Ridge Inc. totaling $1.6 million which were used to pay amounts owed to other creditors of Mineral Ridge Inc. Under the terms of the revised agreement, $5.0 million of mining equipment was contributed to the project by Vista Gold. Net cash flow from the project was to be distributed on the basis of 70% to Dresdner and 30% to Vista Gold after deduction of $800,000 of management fees payable to Vista Gold and rescheduled principal payments on the additional loans used to repay other creditors. The interest rate on the loans was LIBOR plus 2% and the loans, which are not guaranteed by Vista Gold, are collateralized by the assets of Mineral Ridge Inc. and the $5 million of mining equipment contributed by Vista Gold. As part of the agreement with Dresdner, Mineral Ridge Inc. liquidated forward gold hedges to provide $3.5 million, which was used as working capital and to pay for capital improvements on the project.
- 17 -
Prior to the acquisition of the Mineral Ridge mine by the Corporation, the mine had been shut down since December 1997. The mining operation was restarted in late 1998 and the processing plant was commissioned and restarted in early 1999. The plant commissioning activities included a number of modifications, which were identified prior to the acquisition. In addition, a critical ore feeding arrangement, which was identified as inadequate during start-up, was replaced during the month of February 1999.
On December 10, 1999, Mineral Ridge Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vista Gold, voluntarily filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Gold production at the Mineral Ridge mine had failed to meet expectations. Initially, mechanical difficulties and recovery shortfalls inhibited production efforts. But as mining operations continued in the latter half of the year, the ore mined was less than that estimated in the ore reserve calculations. After reviewing the reserves with Independent Mining Consultants, Inc., an independent consultant, it was concluded that significant deficiencies in the ore reserves in the future, compared with the original ore reserve estimates, were probable. The reduced gold production and ore reserves caused by the ore deficiencies and low gold prices resulted in the mine failing to meet its required cash-flow targets under Mineral Ridge Inc.'s loan agreement with Dresdner Bank AG. Various alternatives were then considered, although none were considered to be viable, and a protective bankruptcy filing was made.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
The Mineral Ridge property is located near the town of Silver Peak, approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) southwest of Tonopah, Nevada and covers approximately 3,130 acres (1,267 hectares). The Mineral Ridge mine is an open-pit, heap-leach mining operation owned by Mineral Ridge Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vista Gold. The mine achieved mechanical completion on May 29, 1997 and poured its first gold on June 24, 1997. Operations at the Mineral Ridge mine consisted of open-pit mining, four-stage crushing, agglomeration and heap-leach extraction of gold using conventional cyanide and carbon adsorption methods. The processing facilities were designed to handle a minimum of 2,700 tons (2,449 tonnes) of ore per day over a 350 day operating year. Nine separate mineable gold deposits were defined on the property with several additional areas of inferred mineralization identified. Operations at the Mineral Ridge mine ceased in December 1999.
HISTORY
The Mineral Ridge mine was constructed by Cornucopia for a cost of approximately $17 million. The project was completed on May 17, 1997 and the first gold was poured on June 20, 1997. However, the project failed to meet commercial production loan tests and was shutdown in December 1997. Vista Gold completed an in-depth technical review and undertook a number of modifications to the facility prior to the restart of operations intended to eliminate the problems experienced by Cornucopia. The modifications included changes to the crushing and agglomeration circuits, the addition of surge capacity to the crushing plant, the employment of a coarser crusher product size and the introduction of strong leach solutions during the agglomeration process.
MINING AND PROCESSING
Vista Gold moved a portion of its mining fleet, including four 150-ton (136-tonne) trucks and a 23 cubic-yard (17.6 cubic-meter) hydraulic shovel, from the Hycroft mine to the Mineral Ridge property. The open-pit operations required the mining of approximately 4,000 tons (3,628 tonnes) of ore and 16,000 tons (14,514 tonnes) of waste rock each day. The plant, which uses four-stage crushing and heap
- 18 -
leaching, was estimated to be able to achieve a metallurgical recovery of 75% on ore at an average grade of 0.06 ounces per ton (2.1 grams per tonne).
The mine was in production for just one month in 1998 and continued to operate until December 1999. During 1999, Mineral Ridge mined 6.4 million tons (5.8 million tonnes) of material including 1.1 million tons (1.0 tonnes) of ore. There were 5.033 tons (4.565 tonnes) of waste for every ton of ore mined. The process plant consisted of a four-stage crushing plant, which reduced the rock size to -1/4 inch (-0.6 centimeter) prior to agglomeration with cyanide solution. The agglomerated ore was then placed in approximately 25 feet (7.6 meters) lifts on a heap leach pad. Leaching was carried out using a dilute alkali cyanide solution, which was distributed over the surface of the ore through a network of pipes and drip emitters. The solution percolated down through the layers of ore preferentially leaching gold from the rock. This pregnant solution containing dissolved gold then flowed along the surface of the impervious synthetic liner of the leach pad into the pregnant solution pond. From the pond the solution was pumped through a gold recovery plant at a rate of up to 1000 gallons-per-minute (3,785 litres-per-minute). The gold recovery plant consisted of five carbon columns where activated coconut-shell charcoal (carbon) adsorbed the dissolved gold from the pregnant solution. Solution exiting the carbon plant flowed into a barren pond, pH and cyanide levels were adjusted and the solution was pumped back to the heaps for reuse. This was a closed-circuit process with zero discharge.
Periodically carbon loaded with gold was removed from the columns and the gold was stripped off into a more concentrated solution using a strong, caustic cyanide solution at elevated temperature and pressure. The stripped carbon was reconditioned and returned to the carbon column. The gold-rich strip solution was pumped through electrowinning cells and the gold in solution plated out as metal on stainless steel wool. At regular intervals the wool was removed from the electrowinning cells and the gold was washed off as sludge. The gold sludge was then filtered, dried and melted into dore bars. The dore bars were shipped off site for refining and sale. Gold from the Mineral Ridge mine was refined at Metalor USA Refining Corporation but alternate refineries were available if necessary.
ORE RESERVES
As at December 31, 1998, the Corporation estimated the proven and probable reserves to be 4 million tons (3.6 million tonnes) at a grade of 0.06 ounces per ton (2.1 grams per tonne) containing 241,000 ounces of gold. The average estimated life-of-mine cash production cost was estimated to be $226 per ounce and production was planned to be between 40,000 to 45,000 ounces in 1999. Following the shut down of mining operations in December 1999, the Corporation had no estimated ore reserves at the Mineral Ridge mine.
- 19 -
OPERATING STATISTICS
Start-up activities at the Mineral Ridge mine were commenced in November 1998. Operating statistics for the Mineral Ridge mine during the two months ended December 31, 1998 and the year ended December 31, 1999 are set out below.
- -------------------------
(1) Ore processed means ore placed on the pads but not necessarily leached during the year.
(2) Cash operating costs is composed of all direct mining expenses including inventory changes, refining and transportation costs, less by-product silver credits.
(3) The cash operating costs for the two months ended December 31, 1998 have been omitted because the mine was in the initial start-up phase and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately determine the true cash operating costs.
MINE SITE EXPLORATION
In 1999, exploration activity at the Mineral Ridge mine was limited due to depressed gold prices. However, the Corporation drilled 49 reverse-circulation drill holes. The program consisted of 9,640 feet (2,940 meters) of drilling. Mineralization was encountered at the Blue Lite zone, extending known mineralization 250 feet (76 meters) to the south. Eight of 15 drill holes cut intercepts above cut-off grades. In the Mary Pit area, 17 of 38 holes intersected mineralization above the cut-off grade. These holes were drilled around the margins of the Mary Pit to increase reserves and to extend areas of known resources within 1,000 feet (305 meters) of the current planned Mary Pit. Six holes drilled to intercept downstrike extensions of the Drinkwater mineralization were unsuccessful in locating potentially mineable mineralization.
AMAYAPAMPA AND CAPA CIRCA PROPERTIES
AMAYAPAMPA PROPERTY
SUMMARY
The Amayapampa property consists of 24 mining concessions covering 805 hectares (1,989 acres) plus an additional 6,800 hectares (16,803 acres) in regional exploration and exploitation concessions. The Corporation is in the process of refiling the concessions as required by the new mining law. The deposit is approximately 600 meters (1,970 feet) in strike length, 30 to 70 meters (98 to 230 feet) in width, and extends to over 200 meters (656 feet) in depth. Gold occurs free and associated with sulfides in a structural zone in which quartz veins were emplaced then sheared prior to introduction of sulfides and
- 20 -
gold mineralizing solutions. Prior to the Amalgamation, CEM (as defined below under "Ownership") mined the Amayapampa deposit using primarily open-stope methods at a rate of approximately 220 tons (200 tonnes) of ore per day, and processed the ore in two mills on site. See "Ownership" and "History" below.
Approval of the permit to construct and operate, called the DECLATORIA DE IMPACTO AMBIENTAL, under Article 24 of the Environmental Law was received on May 6, 1998. This permit was based on a 3,300-tonne-per-day (3,638-ton-per-day) ore processing project, and once financing arrangements are in place, the Corporation will request a modification of the permit to allow operation at the lower production rate.
In the fall of 1999, with gold prices rising above $300 per ounce, an update and additional optimization of the feasibility study was begun. It was completed in the first quarter of 2000. Based on a gold price of $300 per ounce, the proven and probable reserves at Amayapampa were calculated by Mine Reserve Associates, Inc., an independent consultant, to be 9.3 million tonnes (10.2 million tons) grading 1.76 grams per tonne (0.051 ounces per ton) including dilution, containing 526,000 ounces of gold. Gold production during the first five years of operations will average approximately 47,400 ounces per year. The initial capital costs are estimated to be about $25 million, including contingency and necessary working capital. Average operating costs are estimated to be $7.99 per tonne ($7.25 per ton) of ore for a total cash cost of $168 per gold ounce. The Corporation is examining various development and production scenarios, and believes that a gold price of $325 per ounce will be required for construction and development to commence. At a gold price of $325 per ounce, the project is expected to generate an after-tax internal rate of return of 20%.
In February 2000, the Corporation signed an agreement with the government of Bolivia, which provides for the immediate refund of value-added taxes and customs duties that would be paid by the Corporation during the construction period. These refunds will be used to pay for certain improvements to infrastructure that are required by the project and will also benefit the inhabitants of the area. The Corporation would be entitled to a refund of these taxes and duties over time anyway, but the agreement accelerates the refund. The acceleration of these refunds will help the project's cash flows during construction. The refunds are expected to total approximately $2.0 million.
LOCATION AND ACCESS
The Amayapampa property is located 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of La Paz in the Chayanta Municipality, Bustillos Province, Department of Potosi, in southwestern Bolivia (Latitude: 18 DEG. 34.5"S, Longitude: 66 DEG. 22.4"W). Access is via 268 kilometers (167 miles) of paved road from La Paz to Machacamarca near Oruro, followed by 100 kilometers (62 miles) of gravel road to Lagunillas, then 14 kilometers (nine miles) of dirt road to Amayapampa. Total driving time is about six hours. Charter air service is available to Uncia, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from the project.
The Amayapampa property is situated within the moderately rugged Eastern Cordilleran region of Bolivia with elevations at the property varying from 3,750 meters to 4,100 meters (12,300 to 13,450 feet) above sea level. The area is generally arid with a defined rainy season during the summer months of November through April. There is little or no precipitation during the rest of the year.
OWNERSHIP
On April 28, 1994, Da Capo entered into an agreement with Mr. David Anthony O'Connor of Casilla 11314, La Paz, Bolivia and La Compania Minera Altoro S.R.L. ("Altoro") of Casilla 11314, La Paz,
- 21 -
Bolivia, both parties at arm's length to Da Capo, which was amended by agreements dated June 10, 1994 and July 15, 1994 (the "Altoro/O'Connor Agreement"), pursuant to which Mr. O'Connor and Altoro assigned to Da Capo:
(a) Altoro's exclusive right and option to acquire a 51% interest in eight mining concessions that constitute a part of the Amayapampa property (and a further option to acquire an additional 19% interest in such concessions), pursuant to an option agreement dated March 22, 1994 (the "Amayapampa Option") between Altoro and Raul Garafulic Gutierrez ("R. Garafulic") of Ave. Argentina No. 2057, Casilla 9285, La Paz, Bolivia and Compania Exploradora de Minas S.A. ("CEM", and collectively with R. Garafulic, the "Amayapampa Vendors") of Calle San Salvador 1421, Casilla 4962, La Paz, Bolivia. The Amayapampa Vendors are both parties at arm's length to Da Capo;
(b) Mr. O'Connor's exclusive right and option to acquire the Capa Circa property pursuant to an option agreement dated January 12, 1994 (the "Yamin Option Agreement") between Mr. O'Connor and Yamin. See "Capa Circa Property - Ownership"; and
(c) a 100% interest in the Santa Isabel Property, for which an exploration concession application had been made on behalf of Altoro.
As consideration for the assignment of the above interests, Da Capo issued a total of 1,000,000 Da Capo common shares to Mr. O'Connor between June 30, 1994 and April 16, 1996.
On February 5, 1996, Da Capo exercised the Amayapampa Option and acquired a 51% interest in the eight mining concessions that constitute a part of the Amayapampa property in consideration for: (i) the cancellation of a loan in the amount of $2,425,000 which had been previously made by Da Capo to R. Garafulic on December 22, 1994; and (ii) payment of $75,000 by Da Capo to R. Garafulic between March 22, 1994 and September 22, 1994.
On March 8, 1996, Da Capo entered into an agreement (the "Amayapampa Acquisition Agreement") with the Amayapampa Vendors to acquire the following interests in the Amayapampa property:
(a) R. Garafulic's remaining 24% interest in two mining concessions (the Gran Porvenir and Chayentena concessions) that are part of the Amayapampa property;
(b) R. Garafulic's 49% interest in six mining concessions that are part of the Amayapampa property; and
(c) CEM's 100% interest in 16 mining concessions that are part of the Amayapampa property.
In consideration for these interests, Da Capo:
(a) issued 1,000,000 special warrants (the "Amayapampa Special Warrants"), each exercisable to acquire one Da Capo Common Share without further payment, to a nominee of the Amayapampa Vendors on April 11, 1996; and
(b) made a non-recourse, interest-free loan of $3.24 million (the "Amayapampa Loan") to a nominee of the Amayapampa Vendors on April 11, 1996.
- 22 -
The Amayapampa Loan was secured by an assignment of all proceeds from the sale of any of 1,000,000 Da Capo common shares held by such nominee. The Amayapampa Loan was canceled on April 29, 1996 upon the sale of such Da Capo common shares and Cdn.$4,355,000 received from the proceeds of such sale on or before May 7, 1996.
After being acquired by the Amayapampa Vendors, the Amayapampa Special Warrants were transferred to third parties at arm's length to Da Capo in transactions exempt from prospectus requirements under the relevant securities legislation.
On August 14, 1996, Da Capo issued 1,000,000 Da Capo common shares without payment of any additional consideration upon the deemed exercise of the Amayapampa Special Warrants.
All of Da Capo's interests in the Amayapampa property were transferred into the name of its subsidiary, Yamin, on April 11, 1996. During 1999 and subsequent to December 31, 1999 these interests were transferred by Yamin to Minera Nueva Vista.
Ms. Elizabeth Mirabel, a resident of Bolivia at arm's length to Vista Gold, holds the remaining 25% interest in the Gran Porvenir and Chayentena mining concessions, which constitute 604 hectares (1,492 acres) of the Amayapampa property. On June 28, 1996, Da Capo and Ms. Mirabel entered into a lease agreement (the "Lease") under which Ms. Mirabel granted a lease for her 25% interest in the two mining concessions in favor of Da Capo for a term of ten years commencing July 10, 1996 and renewable for an additional ten year term. During the first two years of the Lease, Da Capo will pay Ms. Mirabel $7,000 per month, and $10,000 per month for the subsequent eight years.

A legal dispute in Bolivia, in which a Mr. Estanislao Radic brought legal proceedings in the lower penal court in Bolivia against Raul Garafulic, resulted in comments in the Bolivian press questioning the validity of the Corporation's ownership of the Amayapampa property.
