The Mountain Pass Facility
At the Mountain Pass facility, we own an open-pit mine containing one of the world’s most fully developed rare earth deposits outside of China. In addition to the mine, the Mountain Pass facility includes associated crushing, milling, flotation and separation facilities. These facilities are not currently in full operation, and will need to be modernized or refurbished before we can recommence full operations. The Mountain Pass facility is located approximately 60 miles southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada near Mountain Pass, San Bernardino County, California. The Mountain Pass facility straddles Interstate 15 and may be accessed by existing hard-surface roads, which we use to transport products from the Mountain Pass facility to our customers using commercial vehicles.
Molybdenum Corporation of America began REO mining operations at the Mountain Pass facility in 1952. REO production at the Mountain Pass facility, as well as milling and separation processes, continued under Unocal Corporation, which purchased Molybdenum Corporation of America in 1977, until 1998. In 1998, all chemical processing operations were suspended, primarily due to leaks in a wastewater pipeline that transported waste salt water to evaporation ponds on the Ivanpah dry lake bed. Mining and milling operations continued until 2002 when those operations were also placed on standby due to softening prices for REOs, a lack of additional tailings disposal capacity and delays in obtaining permits required for the new paste tailings storage facility. Unocal Corporation thereafter sold or otherwise disposed of substantially all of the mining equipment at the Mountain Pass facility (e.g., shovels, haul trucks, etc.) prior to being acquired by Chevron Corporation in 2005. Operations at the Mountain Pass facility remained suspended until September 2007 when Chevron Mining Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, commenced a NFL pilot processing campaign. Under the NFL campaign, lanthanum, which was produced prior to suspending activities in 1998 and held in lanthanum pond stockpiles at the Mountain Pass facility, was processed in order to recover the related neodymium and praseodymium. The NFL campaign did not constitute the restart of fully integrated operations at the Mountain Pass facility and was used as an opportunity to improve processing technologies
and generate very modest revenue. On September 30, 2008, we acquired the Mountain Pass, California rare earth deposit and associated assets from Chevron Mining Inc. through Rare Earth Acquisitions LLC (which was later renamed Molycorp Minerals, LLC). The acquisition by us excluded certain assets and liabilities, including certain liabilities related to environmental and employment matters, that were retained by Chevron Corporation.
We currently hold a mine plan permit and an associated environmental impact report, which allow continued operations of our Mountain Pass facility through 2042. Since our acquisition of the Mountain Pass facility, we have been processing and selling REOs from stockpiled feedstocks to significantly improve our solvent extraction technologies and capabilities.
We recommenced mining operations in December 2010 and are preparing to recommence milling operations, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012. Prior to the expected completion of our initial modernization and expansion efforts, we expect to produce approximately 3,000 mt per year in the aggregate of cerium products, lanthanum concentrate, didymium oxide and heavy rare earth concentrates from stockpiled feedstock. Recommencement of mining and milling operations is coincident with modernization of our processing capabilities in order to efficiently produce approximately 19,050 mt of REO per year by the end of 2012. In addition, upon completion of our capacity expansion plan, we expect to have the ability to produce up to approximately 40,000 mt of REO per year by the end of 2013.
The Mountain Pass facility consists of approximately 2,222 acres of fee land, of which approximately 770 acres are currently in use (e.g., existing buildings, infrastructure or active disturbance). The lands surrounding the Mountain Pass facility are mostly public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. In addition to the 2,222 acres we hold in fee, we also hold 55 patented claims that are 100% owned by Molycorp and 489 unpatented lode and mineral mining claims and mill sites under the provisions of The Mining Law of 1872. We acquired our mineral rights at the Mountain Pass facility with the purchase of the Mountain Pass, California rare earth deposit and associated assets from Chevron Mining Inc. in 2008. Our mineral rights, surface rights and mining claims are not subject to royalties or encumbrances, although we are responsible for making annual maintenance and tax payments on our unpatented mill sites. These mining claims and mill sites provide land for mining, ancillary facilities and expansion capacity around the Mountain Pass facility.
The Mountain Pass facility includes an open-pit mine, overburden stockpiles, a crusher and mill/flotation plant, a separation plant, a mineral recovery plant tailings storage areas and on-site evaporation ponds, as well as laboratory facilities to support research and development activities, offices, warehouses and support buildings. The majority of the physical plant and equipment at the Mountain Pass facility is over 20 years old, substantially all of which will be replaced as part of our modernization effort. We expect to expand the open-pit mine both laterally to the west, southwest and north as well as deepening vertically. In addition to the existing overburden stockpile located west of the pit, which will serve as the initial overburden stockpile when mining recommences, we will need to construct additional overburden stockpiles to the north or east of the pit to provide additional storage capacity sufficient to accommodate the remaining overburden material for the existing permitted life of the mine.
In connection with our modernization and expansion efforts at the Mountain Pass facility, we expect to build new facilities, including the construction of a control lab, additional warehousing and raw material storage facilities. We plan to add facilities and equipment for metal conversion and alloy production. We also have decided to build a new mill instead of refurbishing our existing mill. The new mill will be sized for daily production of up to 2,000 mt. All the new design changes are allowed under our current operating permits. In November 2009, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire a third-party producer of rare earth metals and alloys in the United States. Discussions with this third party had previously ceased. Although we have recently resumed discussions with this third party, we cannot ensure that we will be able to execute a definitive agreement to acquire this third party. If we are able to acquire another third-party producer of rare earth metals and alloys or add another off-site facility to produce rare earth metals and alloys, instead of adding such facilities and equipment at Mountain Pass, we would transport cerium, lanthanum, neodymium,
praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium and samarium oxide products from our Mountain Pass facility to that off-site location to produce rare earth metals and alloys.
We also expect to build a new paste tailings operation and new roads at the Mountain Pass facility. The construction of the paste tailings operation, which consists of a paste tailings filter plant and paste tailings storage facility, is authorized by our San Bernardino County conditional use permit, and we began its construction during the second quarter of 2010. The capital cost for the paste tailings operation, which is included in the estimated capital expenditure for the expansion of the separation plant, is estimated to be $10 million. Although the operating cost of the paste tailings operation is expected to be greater than it would be for a tailings pond, which is the method prior owners used at the Mountain Pass facility, we expect that the increased water recycling and reduced environmental risks associated with the paste tailings facility will ultimately mitigate that additional cost.
In addition, we intend to produce hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide at our own chlor-alkali plant at the Mountain Pass facility, thereby reducing our reliance on external sources of reagents. While the production of our own hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide will utilize proven technologies, these technologies have not yet been implemented in the rare earth industry. Not only would the chlor-alkali plant reduce our need for external sources of reagents, but it would also reduce our production of waste salt water. Previous owners of the Mountain Pass facility used a waste water pipeline to dispose of waste salt water in evaporation ponds on the Ivanpah dry lake bed. When we acquired the Mountain Pass facility from Chevron Mining Inc. in 2008, we did not acquire the ponds or the wastewater pipeline that ran from the Mountain Pass facility to the Ivanpah lake bed. Because of this decision, and Chevron Mining Inc.’s ongoing removal of the wastewater pipeline, use of these ponds is no longer an available option for the Mountain Pass facility. Accordingly, wastewater must be dealt with in a different manner. We intend to utilize our chlor-alkali plant to convert waste salt water to hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, which will be recycled into the process. Through this process, approximately 913 million pounds of water and 101 million pounds of salt would be recycled back to the chlor-alkali plant per year in order to achieve the annual production rate of 19,050 anticipated following the completion of our initial modernization and expansion plan. We expect these amounts to double if our annual production rate is increased to 40,000 mt of REO per year in connection with our capacity expansion plan. This process would avoid the need for disposal of waste salt water in evaporation ponds. Additionally, because the water is internally recycled, the need for fresh water from our two water supply well fields to run the Mountain Pass processing facilities would be dramatically reduced.
Following the completion of our initial modernization and expansion efforts, we expect to have the ability to mine, crush, mill and separate 2,000 tons of rare earth ore per day to produce individual REOs that meet or exceed industry standards for purity. However, we will only need to process up to approximately 1,100 to 1,200 tons of rare earth ore per day to meet the annual production goal of 19,050 mt of REO under our initial modernization and expansion plan. If we increase our annual production rate to 40,000 mt of REO in connection with our capacity expansion plan, we will need to process up to approximately 2,200 to 2,400 tons of rare earth ore per day. Our modernization and expansion plans envision adding facilities and equipment for metal conversion and alloy production at the Mountain Pass facility or an off-site property. If we add an off-site facility to produce rare earth metals and alloys instead of adding such facilities and equipment at Mountain Pass, we would transport cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium and samarium oxide products from our Mountain Pass facility to that off-site location to produce rare earth metals and alloys. In December 2010, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Hitachi to form joint ventures for the production of rare earth alloys and magnets in the United States and to acquire a license for certain technology related to the production of rare earth metals, alloys and magnets. Additionally, we have entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Neo Material that, among other things, contemplates a technology transfer agreement pursuant to which Neo Material may provide us with technical assistance and know-how with respect to the production of rare earth metals, alloys and magnets. This “mine-to-magnets” strategy, if successfully implemented, would make us the first fully integrated supplier of NdFeB magnets in the world and the only producer of NdFeB magnets in the United States. In addition, we are working to identify and develop new downstream opportunities for the REOs, rare earth metals and alloys and rare earth products we will manufacture. Our proposed joint ventures with Hitachi would provide us with access to the
technology, people and facilities to convert our rare earth materials into rare earth alloys and high-performance permanent rare earth magnets required for production of hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power turbines, high-tech applications and numerous advanced defense systems on which the U.S. economy and national security depend. The consummation of such joint ventures, in conjunction with our current modernization plans and the potential technology transfer agreement with Neo Material, is expected to provide us with the capability to mine, process, separate and alloy individual REEs and manufacture them into NdFeB magnets.
Our facilities currently rely on electricity provided by Southern California Edison. Due to its position on the regional electric grid, the Mountain Pass facility can experience power shortages during peak periods. Instability in electrical supply in past years has caused sporadic outages and brownouts. Such outages and brownouts have had a negative impact on our production. In connection with our initial modernization and expansion efforts at the Mountain Pass facility, we expect to build a new 24 megawatt co-generation power plant that will use natural gas to provide reliable electricity and steam to our facilities to allow us to achieve our anticipated annual production rate of approximately 19,050 mt of REO. The completion of the co-generation power plant is dependent on several factors, including obtaining the permits required to build and operate the co-generation power plant. Following the completion of the co-generation power plant, we expect it to provide 100% of our production power requirements to achieve an annual production rate of 19,050 mt of REO and 83% of our overall power requirements. In connection with our capacity expansion plan, we will add two additional turbines to the co-generation power plan to increase the plant’s capacity to 49 megawatts, which will allow us to achieve an annual production rate of approximately 40,000 mt of REO. At an annual production rate of 40,000 mt of REO per year, we expect the co-generation power plant to provide 100% of our production power requirements and 91% of our overall power requirements.
We have secured all permits necessary to allow construction to start on the Mountain Pass facility modernization and expansion project. Numerous other government permits and approvals are required in order for us to proceed with our modernization and expansion efforts. These include air permits, various building permits and permits related to the use and storage of radioactive or hazardous materials.
The Mountain Pass REE deposit is located within an uplifted block of Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks that are bounded to the south and east by basin-fill deposits in California’s Ivanpah Valley. The two main groups of rocks in the Mountain Pass area are Early Proterozoic high-grade metamorphic rocks and Middle Proterozoic ultrapotassic rocks and monazitic carbonatites, which carbonatites are associated with higher levels of REEs. The currently defined zone of REE mineralization exhibits a strike length of approximately 2,750 feet in a north-northwest direction and extends for approximately 7,000 feet down dip from surface. The true thickness of the greater than 3.0% REO zone ranges from 15 feet to 250 feet. The percentage of each rare earth material contained in the Mountain Pass facility bastnasite ore is estimated to be as follows:
Rare Earth Reserves and Non-Reserve Deposits
As of February 6, 2010, SRK Consulting, an independent consulting firm that we have retained to assess our reserves, estimated total proven reserves of 88.0 million pounds of REO contained in 0.480 million tons of ore, with an average ore grade of 9.38%, and probable reserves based on historic and estimated recoveries of 2.12 billion pounds of REO contained in 13.108 million tons of ore, with an average ore grade of 8.20%, in each case using a cutoff grade of 5.0% REO. As of December 31, 2010, our estimated proven and probable reserves were 88.0 million pounds of REO and 2.12 billion pounds of REO, respectively.
SEC Guidelines
The SEC has established guidelines contained in Industry Guide to assist registered companies as they estimate ore reserves. These guidelines set forth technical, legal and economic criteria for determining whether our ore reserves can be classified as proven and probable.
“Reserves” are defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit that could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. SEC Industry Guide 7 divides reserves between “proven reserves” and “probable reserves,” which are defined as follows:
•
“proven reserves” are reserves for which:
•
quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and
•
the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.
•
“probable reserves” are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Methodology
The Mountain Pass facility has been subject to extensive drilling since the beginning of mining operations in 1952, including drilling data for 152 holes totaling 83,216 feet. We also maintain detailed geologic logs, on-site assay records and databases and geologic cross-sections. In addition, we have recently expanded our on-site exploratory drilling program to confirm the existence and extent of bastnasite, monazite and other rare earth phosphate mineral occurrences in unexplored areas of the Mountain Pass facility. When estimating proven and probable reserves, however, we currently rely on the interpretations made during prior mining campaigns at our Mountain Pass facility, the U.S. Geological Survey and various consulting companies, including SRK Consulting, to identify the regional and mine area geology and hydrogeology, regional and local structure, deposit geology, current pit slope stability conditions and REE recoveries.
Proven Reserves. SRK Consulting compiled a drill hole database from prior drilling at the Mountain Pass site that includes a total of 137 drill holes with a cumulative length of 79,453 feet. Individual drill holes range in length from 56 feet to 2,012 feet, and averaged 580 feet. The majority of core samples in the deposit area analyzed by SRK Consulting range from 50 feet to 250 feet along the strike of the ore body and 150 feet to 350 feet down dip. The sample data for proven ore reserves consists of survey data, lithologic data and assay results.
Probable Reserves. Probable ore reserves are based on longer projections and the maximum distance between drill holes is 200 feet. Statistical modeling and the established continuity of the bastnasite ore body as determined from results of over 50 years of mining activity to date support our technical confidence in estimates of tonnage and grade over this projection distance. Where appropriate, projections for the probable ore reserve determination are constrained by any known or anticipated restrictive geologic features.
Based on the review of historic sample preparation and analytical procedures, SRK Consulting initiated a sample check assay program of 1% of the assay database. The material remaining from previous drilling programs consisted of split core stored at the Mountain Pass facility. SRK Consulting examined the existing split core using third-party preparation and analytical laboratories. SRK Consulting determined that the overall results of the sample check assay program indicated that our historic data was acceptable for use in preparing their report. While we believe that a cut off grade below 5.0% is economically viable, SRK Consulting decided to base the mining cut-off calculation on a grade of 5.0% REO given historical performance at the Mountain Pass mine.
The proven and probable ore reserves are then modeled as a long-term mine plan and additional factors including recoveries, metal prices, mine operating costs and capital estimates are applied to determine the overall economics of the ore reserves.
Results
Proven and probable reserves at the Mountain Pass facility as of December 31, 2010 are estimated to be approximately 88.0 million pounds of REO contained in 0.480 million tons of ore, with an average ore grade of 9.38%, and 2.12 billion pounds of REO contained in 13.108 million tons of ore, with an average ore grade of 8.20%, respectively, in each case, using a cut-off grade of 5.0%. We base our REO reserve estimates and non-reserve REO deposit information on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by SRK Consulting, which includes various engineers and geologists. Our estimates of REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits as to both quantity and quality will be regularly updated to reflect new drilling or other data received.
The following table provides information as of February 6, 2010 on the amount of our proven and probable REO reserves, which was used to calculate our estimated proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2010.
In making the estimate above, SRK Consulting:
•
assumed we have a 100% working interest in the Mountain Pass facility;
•
assumed full mining recovery;
•
assumed that mine reserves are fully diluted;
•
assumed a historic cut-off grade of 5.0% REO within the pit design;
•
assumed a metallurgical recovery factor of 65% for the mill facility and 93% for the extraction and separation facilities;
•
used the 1997 surface topography for volume control of reserves;
•
used the historic three-year average commodity prices set forth in table below; and
•
rounded values to the nearest significant number.
Pricing values shown in the following table were used by SRK Consulting in the estimate of our reserves. The prices reflect a combination of three-year averages for REOs and metals based on information from (i) Metal-Pages, (ii) IMCOA and Roskill market studies from 2009 and (iii) alloy pricing formulas.

Prices for certain rare earth products have increased from those used by SRK Consulting in its engineering study. The prices set forth in the following table, are primarily based on information from Metal-Pages and alloy pricing formulas as of January 27, 2011.

Molycorp market price estimates
Although SRK Consulting assumed pricing levels consistent with those estimated by Roskill, a 38% decrease in average REE prices from such levels, holding all other variables constant, would not materially reduce reserve estimates.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. We will regularly evaluate our REO reserve and non-reserve REO estimates. This will typically be done in conjunction with expanded, phased drilling programs. Cores are analyzed by geologists to determine mineral types and to identify geological anomalies. Samples along the length of the core are logged and analyzed for total rare earth content, rare earth distribution and mineralogy. This data is entered into a master database and statistically analyzed. The resulting information is used to enhance the mine plan. We also gain information from blast hole cuttings. The estimates of REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits as to both quantity and quality will also be updated to reflect new drilling or other data received. Estimates of economically
recoverable REO reserves, however, necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:
•
geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;
•
assumptions concerning future prices of rare earth products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and
•
assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.
Actual REO tonnage recovered from identified REO reserve and non-reserve REO deposit areas and revenues and expenditures with respect to the same may vary materially from estimates. These estimates may not accurately reflect our actual REO reserves or non-reserve REO deposits. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our REO reserves and non-reserve REO deposits could result in lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs.
Engineering Study
SRK Consulting prepared an engineering study to determine, among other things, the size of the underlying ore body and a mine plan for the restart of the Mountain Pass mine and the refurbishment of the processing facilities in connection with our initial modernization and expansion plan. As originally envisioned, the restart plan includes integrated off-site facilities for production of metals and rare earth magnet alloys. SRK Consulting designed the mine plan to ensure an annual production rate of approximately 19,050 mt of REO.
Subsequent to the original engineering study, we proceeded with additional detailed engineering and process testwork for the project. While substantive elements of the engineering design remain fixed in terms of function, our ongoing testing effort through the first quarter of 2011 will finalize the operating cost estimate for oxide production. Following completion of the operating cost review, updated process costs and recoveries will be reflected in the proven and probable reserve statement. At the present time, as a result of increased REE prices, the estimated economic cut-off grade for the deposit is less than the 5% cut-off grade applied by SRK Consulting. Due to the differential between the estimated economic cut-off grade and 5.0% “hard” cut-off grade, there is a margin for operating cost variation without a material adjustment in the proven and probable reserve estimate.
We approved the following changes to the original engineering study. These changes are provided for clarity and do not have a material impact on the proven and probable reserve estimate:
•
We conducted additional drilling and exploration work between December 2009 and April 2010 with a primary focus on in-fill drilling and a secondary focus on condemnation. We plan to conduct additional drilling and exploration work in 2011.
•
As disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010, we will construct a new mill rather than refurbish the existing mill prior to the start of full-scale production. With this change, SRK Consulting revised the mine plan to reflect improved access to ore in the southwest and south portion of the open pit. Fundamental production criteria remained unchanged (e.g., 5.0% REO cut-off grade, 19,050 mt REO per year, and overall recovery of 60%); therefore, there is no material change in the mine production schedule. However, the pit layouts over time shown in the original engineering study (e.g., Figures 6.2 through 6.7) will not match the current pit layouts.
•
We changed the location of the extraction and separations facilities, as well as related infrastructure, from the northwest portion of our property to immediately southeast of the existing process facilities.
While the location of these facilities has changed, the production process has not. Accordingly, Figure 7.8 General Facilities Arrangement for the Extraction and Separation Facilities in the original engineering study is no longer valid.
•
Updated project capital costs are within 10% of the estimated capital costs in the original engineering study.
•
Project planning during the development phase will be performed by us and Eichleay Engineers of California, a consulting firm specializing in project delivery.
We will authorize SRK Consulting to revise the engineering study and to make material adjustments, if any, to the reserve statement following completion of the updated operating cost review and testwork related to process recoveries.
In light of strong industry fundamentals, including reduced Chinese supply and strong pricing increases, our Board of Directors has approved a second-phase capacity expansion plan in addition to our initial modernization plan. Upon the completion of this expansion plan, by the end of 2013, we expect to have the ability to produce up to approximately 40,000 mt of REO per year at our Mountain Pass facility, or approximately double the amount we will be able to produce upon completion of our initial modernization and expansion plan.
SRK Consulting prepared its engineering study in connection with our initial modernization and expansion plan, but has not yet reviewed the second-phase capacity expansion plan or prepared a revised engineering study to reflect and potential impact of the second-phase capacity expansion on capital costs, operating expenses, mine life or reserve estimates. SRK Consulting has preliminarily indicated, however, that doubling the amount of production pursuant to the second-phase capacity expansion plan would reduce the current mine life by half, assuming no additional exploration, no realization of anticipated improvements in recoveries, and all other factors remain constant.
Corporate Headquarters
We also lease our executive office space at 5619 Denver Tech Center Parkway, Greenwood Village, Colorado. The leases for Suite 1000 and Suite 1005 expire November 2016 and February 2012, respectively, subject to renewal options.
