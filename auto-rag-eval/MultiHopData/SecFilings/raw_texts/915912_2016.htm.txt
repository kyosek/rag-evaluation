ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities. While we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis, we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, Redevelopment or Unconsolidated according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the respective prior year. The Established Communities for the year ended December 31, 2016 are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2015, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities are all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's pre-redevelopment basis and is expected to have a material impact on the operations of the community, including occupancy levels and future rental rates.
•
Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, where we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land, where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community, or where we are the designated developer in a public-private partnership. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
We currently lease our corporate headquarters located in Arlington, Virginia, as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2016, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:
_________________________________
(1)
Development Communities includes AVA North Point, expected to contain 265 apartment homes, which is being developed within a joint venture.
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
We generally establish the composition of our Established Communities portfolio annually. Determined as of January 1 of each of the respective years, the Established Communities portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
_________________________________
(1)
We remove a community from our Established Communities portfolio for the upcoming year (and then generally maintain that designation) if we believe that planned activity for a community for the upcoming year will result in that community's expected operations not being comparable to the prior year period. We believe that a community's expected operations will not be comparable to the prior year period when we intend either (i) to undertake a significant capital renovation of the community, such that we would consider the community to be classified as a Redevelopment Community; or (ii) to dispose of a community through a sale or other disposition transaction.
(2)
Avalon at Edgewater was moved from the Established Communities portfolio to the Other Stabilized portfolio as a result of the fire that occurred in January 2015.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities include garden-style apartment communities consisting of multi-story buildings in landscaped settings, as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings. As of January 31, 2017, our Current Communities consisted of the following:
_________________________________
(1)
Includes 16 communities with 5,186 apartment homes that include town homes.
Our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features, which may include:
•
fully-equipped kitchens;
•
lofts and vaulted ceilings;
•
walk-in closets;
•
patios/decks; and
•
modern appliances.
Other features at various communities may include:
•
swimming pools;
•
fitness centers;
•
tennis courts; and
•
wi-fi lounges.
As described in Item 1. “Business,” we operate under three core brands Avalon, AVA and Eaves by Avalon. Our core “Avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services. “AVA” targets customers in high energy, transit-served urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus. “Eaves by Avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious, “value” segment in suburban areas. We believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price.
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service-oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe our mission of Creating a Better Way To Live helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed construction of 1,715 apartment homes in eight communities and sold twelve operating communities containing an aggregate of 4,026 apartment homes. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 19.3 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the weighted average age of our Current Communities is 12.5 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2017, we owned (directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries):
•
242 operating communities, including 226 with a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest and 16 that are on land subject to a land lease, four of which are dual-branded communities with each pair of dual-branded communities being governed by a single land lease. The leases expire in October 2026, November 2028, May 2041, July 2046, December 2061, September 2065, November 2067, December 2086, April 2095, May 2105, September 2105, April 2106, November 2106 and March 2142;
•
a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in Fund II, the U.S. Fund and the AC JV. Subsidiaries of Fund II own a fee simple interest in three operating communities, subsidiaries of the U.S. Fund own a fee simple interest in seven operating communities, of which one is subject to a land lease, and subsidiaries of the AC JV own a fee simple interest in three operating communities;
•
a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a “DownREIT,” as described more fully below, that owns one community; and
•
a membership interest in three limited liability companies, that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community.
For some communities, a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration. We have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in October 2026, November 2028, May 2041, July 2046, December 2086 and April 2095.
We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in 25 of the 27 Development Communities. One Development Community is being developed within a joint venture and one Development Community is being developed with a private development partner and we will own the multifamily rental portion of the development.
In our partnership structured as a DownREIT, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. Limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Under the partnership agreement for the DownREIT, the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2017, there were 7,500 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
Development Communities
As of December 31, 2016, we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 27 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 9,129 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $4,045,000,000. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually, or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (including the factors identified under “Forward-Looking Statements”) for further discussion of development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities (directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary) unless otherwise noted in the table.
_________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Projected total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Initial projected occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
Developments containing at least 10,000 square feet of retail space include Avalon Huntington Beach (10,000 square feet), Avalon West Hollywood (32,000 square feet), Avalon Esterra Park (17,000 square feet), Avalon Newcastle Commons I (15,000 square feet), 11 West 61st Street (67,000 square feet), Avalon Belltown Towers (11,000 square feet) and AVA Hollywood (19,000 square feet).
(5)
We are developing this project with a private development partner. We will own the rental portion of the development on floors 3 through 19 and the partner will own the for-sale condominium portion on floors 20 through 30 of the development. The information above represents only our portion of the project. We are providing a construction loan to the development partner, expected to be $48,800,000 which together with the partner's contributed equity is expected to fund the condominium portion of the project. A more detailed description of Avalon Sheepshead Bay can be found in Note 5, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
(6)
In February 2017, a fire occurred at at Avalon Maplewood. See "Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses" for further discussion.
(7)
We are developing this project within a joint venture that was formed in July 2016, in which we own a 55.0% interest. The information above represents the total cost for the venture.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company completed the development of the following communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Total capitalized cost is as of December 31, 2016. We generally anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments.
(2)
Approximate rentable area includes 16,000 square feet of retail space.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2016, there were four communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $80,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost does not include capitalized costs incurred prior to redevelopment.
(2)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
Development Rights
At December 31, 2016, we had $84,293,000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own, and $40,179,000 in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land, as well as land associated with the building destroyed in the Edgewater (as defined below) casualty loss not considered a Development Right. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 25 Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of December 31, 2016 includes $63,082,000 in original land acquisition costs. The original land acquisition cost per home, after consideration of planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate, ranged from $24,000 per home in Washington to $51,000 per home in Virginia. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 8,487 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.
For 18 Development Rights, we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel. While we generally prefer to hold Development Rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land, for the five remaining Development Rights we either currently own the land, have an ownership interest in a joint venture that owns the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. In addition, two Development Rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own, and will be constructed on land currently associated with those operating communities. During the next 12 months we expect to commence construction of apartment communities on three of the Development Rights for which we currently own the land, with a carrying basis of $49,584,000.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights, for which future development is not yet considered probable, are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2016, we incurred a charge of approximately $4,183,000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed.
You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The following presents a summary of the Development Rights:
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
Land Acquisitions
We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2016 we acquired land parcels for eight Development Rights, as shown in the table below, for an aggregate investment of $101,372,000. For all of the parcels, construction has either started or is expected to start within the next 12 months.
____________________________________
(1)
Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land and related acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, net of projected proceeds for any planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate.
Other Land and Real Estate Assets
We own land parcels with a carrying value of $46,958,000, which we do not currently plan to develop, of which $20,846,000 was under contract to be sold as of December 31, 2016 and was disposed of in January 2017. These parcels consist of both ancillary parcels acquired in connection with Development Rights that we had not planned to develop and land parcels we acquired for development and now intend to sell. During 2016, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $10,500,000 relating to three ancillary land parcels which we either sold during the year or intend to sell as of the date of this report. We believe that the current carrying value for all other land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value, or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired. However, we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are future indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value, less costs to dispose.
Disposition Activity
We sell assets when they do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition, development or redevelopment activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017, we sold our interest in seven wholly-owned communities, containing 2,051 apartment homes. The aggregate gross sales price for these assets was $522,850,000.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, along with other insurance policies we maintain, have policy specifications, insured and self-insured limits, exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels. We procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with limits of $175,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes. However for communities located in California or Washington, the limit is $150,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes. The deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in California is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $25,000,000 per loss.
Our communities are insured for property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or coverage provided under a master property insurance policy covering the majority of our communities. The master policy provides a $400,000,000 limit for any single occurrence, subject to certain sublimits and exclusions. Under the master policy we are subject to a $100,000 deductible per occurrence, as well as additional self-insured retention for the next $350,000 of loss, per occurrence, until the aggregate incurred self-insured retention exceeds $1,500,000 for the policy year.
Our communities are insured for third-party liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance policies. The master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions, and require a self-insured retention of $250,000 per occurrence.
We utilize a wholly-owned captive insurance company to insure certain risks, which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses and other construction related liability risks. The captive is directly responsible for 12% of the losses incurred by the master property insurance policy, on a per occurrence basis, in excess of any applicable deductibles up to the first $50,000,000 of loss.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In January 2015, the President signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) which extended a program that is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back-stop program. Certain communities are insured for terrorism related losses through this federal program. We have also purchased private-market insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of $600,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages (not covered under TRIPRA) such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through TRIPRA (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.
An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) and limited cyber liability insurance. The crime policies protect us, up to $30,000,000 per occurrence (subject to sublimits and exclusions), from employee theft of money, securities or property. The limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of $15,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. The cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach, wrongful acts, data privacy issues and media liability.
The amount of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover losses.
Maplewood Casualty Loss
In February 2017, a fire occurred at our Avalon Maplewood Development Community, located in Maplewood, NJ, which was under construction and not yet occupied. We are currently assessing our direct losses resulting from the fire, which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild the portion of the Development Community that was destroyed and/or damaged, as well as our potential liability to third parties who may have incurred damages on account of the fire. While we currently believe that our direct losses and any potential liability to third parties will be substantially covered by our insurance policies, including coverage for the replacement cost of the building, third party claims and business interruption loss, subject to deductibles as well as a self-insured portion of the property insurance for which we are obligated for 12% of the first $50,000,000 in losses, we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter.
Edgewater Casualty Loss
In January 2015, a fire occurred at our Avalon at Edgewater apartment community located in Edgewater, NJ (“Edgewater”). Edgewater consisted of two residential buildings. One building, containing 240 apartment homes, was destroyed. The second building, containing 168 apartment homes, suffered minimal damage and has been repaired. In January 2016, we reached a final settlement with our property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the Edgewater casualty loss, for which we received aggregate insurance proceeds of $73,150,000, after self-insurance and deductibles. We received $44,142,000 of these recoveries in 2015, and the remaining $29,008,000 in 2016, of which $8,702,000 was recognized as an additional net casualty gain and $20,306,000 as business interruption insurance proceeds.
To date, a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us, including five purported class actions, 21 individual actions and other subrogation actions by insurers who provided renters insurance to our residents. Having incurred applicable deductibles, we currently believe that all of our remaining liability to third parties will not be material and will in any event be substantially covered by our insurance policies. However, we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter.
