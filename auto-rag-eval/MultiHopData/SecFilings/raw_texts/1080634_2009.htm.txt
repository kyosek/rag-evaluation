ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We share the use of premises in Australia at Level 21, 500 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia from which our Australian subsidiaries carry on business. The Australian office space is taken on a non-exclusive basis, with no rent payable, but the usage of the premises is included in the charges that Setright Oil & Gas Pty Ltd., (an affiliate of the Company by virtue of common management, ownership and control) makes in respect to the administration of the Company.
Following implementation of our acquisition strategy we now hold interests in 11 Petroleum Exploration Permits granted by the Commonwealth of Australia. With one exception, they are held in joint venture with other parties.
Vulcan Sub-basin Interests, Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Australia (AC/P33, AC/P35 and AC/P39)
Geologically, AC/P33, AC/P35 and AC/P39 are located on the eastern margin of the Vulcan Sub-basin, a broad, deep and proven hydrocarbon-generative basin, one of a number of proven petroliferous sub-basins which together comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia.
The permits are within the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands (“the Territory”), an Australian offshore territory which was ceded from Britain and accepted by the Commonwealth of Australia (“Commonwealth”) in 1933. The responsibility for the administration of the Territory was transferred from the Northern Territory of Australia (“Northern Territory”) to the Commonwealth when a level of self-government was instituted in the Northern Territory in 1978.
The Territory comprises West, Middle and East Islands of Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island and a large area of territorial sea generated by those islands. The Territory is an area of active offshore oil and gas exploration. The islands are uninhabited, small, low and composed of coral and sand, with some grass cover.
The Territory is located on the outer edge of the continental shelf in the Indian Ocean approximately 320 km off Australia’s north-west coast and 144 kilometres south of the Indonesian Island of Roti. The Jabiru and Challis oil fields are located within the Territory, as are numerous other oil and gas accumulations and occurrences.
Petroleum extraction activities within the Territory are administered on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy through the Designated Authority protocol operating pursuant to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (Commonwealth).
Commonwealth laws, laws of the Northern Territory and Ordinances made by the Governor-General make up the body of law generally applicable in the Territory.
We acquired our initial 20% interest in the Vulcan Sub-basin permits as a result of the acquisition of Alpha Oil & Natural Gas Pty Ltd (“Alpha”) in 2006.
On May 15, 2006 Alpha agreed to farmout 5% of its 20% interest in each of the Vulcan Sub-basin permits to National Gas Australia Pty Ltd (“NGA”) (leaving Alpha with a 15% interest), in return for the acquisition and funding of Alpha’s 20% share of the new Oliver 3D seismic survey of approximately 124 km² and the funding of the cost of reprocessing of approximately 2,800 km² of the existing Onnia 3D Seismic Survey data, relevant to all of AC/P33, AC/P35 and AC/P39. The cost of the Company’s share of the Oliver 3D seismic survey and the Onnia reprocessing has thus been met entirely by NGA. NGA subsequently transferred its interests to its wholly owned subsidiary, Petrocorp Australia Pty Ltd.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha, established a wholly owned subsidiary named Vulcan Australia Pty Ltd (“Vulcan”) and transferred its interests in each of its Timor Sea permits, AC/P33, AC/P35 and AC/P39 to Vulcan.
We subsequently farmed out half of our interest in AC/P33 to Stuart Petroleum Limited (“Stuart”) (see Oliver Joint Venture below), leaving us with a 7.5% interest.
In addition, the singular joint venture operating agreement, which previously governed joint venture operations in all three of the permits, has been replaced by new separate joint venture agreements for each permit. The new joint ventures are known as Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33), Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35) and Nome Joint Venture (AC/P39).
Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33)
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Vulcan, following farmout of drilling and development commitments made by Stuart (see below), until the recent sale (see below) held a 7.5% interest in the Oliver Joint Venture permit, AC/P33, in joint venture with Stuart (50%), the designated operator, and our joint venture affiliates; Petrocorp Australia Pty Ltd (“Petrocorp”) (12.5%), Natural Gas Corporation Pty Ltd (NGC) (15%) and Auralandia N.L. (Auralandia) (15%).
AC/P33 (granted July 6, 2004) includes the undeveloped Oliver oil and gas accumulation, drilled by the now plugged and abandoned Oliver-1 well. AC/P33 comprises five graticular blocks, totalling approximately 400 km² (98,800 acres). During the first three years of the initial 6-year term of permit AC/P33, the joint venture participants obtained a range of existing reports and open file seismic data and mapped, interpreted and revised analyses and concepts for the area. The joint venture carried out enhancement of existing seismic data around the Oliver feature and examined various techniques with potential to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators. As a result of the farmout to NGA, the joint venture acquired 124 km² of new high quality enhanced parameter 3D seismic survey, known as the Oliver 3D Seismic Survey. The survey was conducted over the Oliver feature and part of its extension to the east. Processing of the new Oliver Seismic Survey and reprocessing of part of the immediately adjacent Onnia 3D Seismic Survey in the vicinity of the Oliver-1 well was carried out.
The joint venture elected to enter the second three years of the initial permit and, following farmout, Stuart made plans to drill one exploration well in late 2009/early 2010, and to perform further interpretational work at its cost.
Stuart’s earn-in obligations were to be satisfied by sole funding the drilling of an appraisal well on the Oliver feature, completion of engineering studies up to final investment decision for development of an oilfield and sole funding the first $25 million of development expenditure.
On February 18, 2010 Vulcan completed the sale of its 7.5% interest in AC/P33 to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited, a major Thailand petroleum exploration and production company. Vulcan recovered $ 4,244,679 for its 7.5% interest. These proceeds will be utilized in meeting a large proportion of our obligations to the Braveheart Joint Venture and Cornea Joint Venture with respect to the costs associated with the recent drilling of the Braveheart-1 well and Cornea-3 well.
Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35)
AC/P35 (granted October 18, 2005) is located immediately to the north of AC/P33. It comprises 46 graticular blocks, totalling approximately 3,410 km² (842,645 acres). There have been five wells drilled in the area, with two having oil and gas indications, all of which were plugged and abandoned. During the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the AC/P35 permit, we obtained a range of pertinent existing reports and open file seismic data. We also acquired the right to the reprocessed Onnia 3D seismic data-set of some 1,750 km² within AC/P35. On June 15, 2009 the company was granted a 12 month extension on year three of the permit. Year three now ends April 17, 2010 and includes an existing work obligation to shoot up to 250 km² of a new 3D seismic survey and a new obligation for 200km of 2D seismic, which we have met with a 275 km acquisition (see below).
Our geological evaluation of this permit during the quarter saw the development of the Fairfax feature as a focus of our exploration efforts in AC/P35. The Fairfax feature was not within the area of coverage of the Onnia 3D survey, being in the west of AC/P35 and being covered only by some older seismic lines acquired by previous explorers. We saw the potential for the Fairfax feature to be a possible mirror-image of the Oliver oil/gas accumulation. In order to better understand the feature and to advance it to lead status, we decided to acquire a 2D seismic survey to infill the existing data bank and to constrain the south-western end of the feature. The Fairfax 2D seismic was completed during the year, with approximately 275 kms of new high quality 2D acquired, utilizing Bergen Offshore’s BOS Atlantic vessel. The joint venture plans to co-process the new acquisition and some of the pre-existing seismic lines which are already held over the Fairfax feature.
Before their decision to sell out of AC/P33, Stuart Petroleum had shown significant interest in Fairfax, such that Stuart took an option to acquire a 250 km² 3D survey over Fairfax in return for meeting the cost of the Fairfax 2D survey.
On July 27, 2009, Stuart Petroleum Limited signed an agreement with the Vulcan Joint Venture participants in relation to AC/P35. Stuart agreed to fund the cost of acquisition and processing of a 2D seismic survey over the Fairfax feature in AC/P35. The cost of
this work was estimated at $240,000 and the data was acquired in August 2009.
Following acquisition and processing of the Fairfax 2D seismic, Stuart would have become entitled, at its option, to earn up to a 70% participating interest in AC/P35.
However, subsequently, as a condition to agreeing to Stuart’s arrangement with PTT in relation to AC/P33, the joint venture participants insisted that Stuart relinquish all rights to AC/P35, which has occurred.

Nome Joint Venture (AC/P39)
AC/P39 (granted April 7, 2006) is located 600 km west of Darwin, immediately to the east of AC/P33 and AC/P35. It comprises 11 graticular blocks, totalling approximately 920 km² (2,273 acres). AC/P39 lies within 100 km of existing petroleum production facilities and along the eastern elevated flank of the Vulcan Sub-basin. There have been five wells drilled in the area, with two having oil and gas indications. In the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the AC/P39 permit, we obtained a range of existing reports and open file seismic data. We requested a 12 month suspension and extension of Year 2 in order to complete the reprocessing of 920 km² Onnia 3D seismic survey within the permit. The re-processing has now been completed, but was delayed because of the manpower constraints of the contractor. Geological evaluation of the permit is continuing, including the assessment of risk as to whether any leads are of sufficient quality to warrant the risk and cost of drilling and the likelihood of a farminee being prepared to meet the cost of such a well.
Interpretation of approximately 920 km² of reprocessed Onnia 3D seismic within AC/P39 is on-going. We are planning for a further 3D seismic program over our best lead in AC/P39, before making any commitment to drill a well.
We have developed nine high risk/high impact leads within AC/P39 ranging in size from a mean scope for recovery of prospective resources of 21 million barrels (Tancred NE lead) to 340 million barrels (Ceto lead).

BROWSE BASIN INTERESTS, OFFSHORE FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA
- WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P
The Browse Basin region is a major proven hydrocarbon area and it forms a part of the extensive series of continental margin sedimentary basins that, together, comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia. The Browse Basin has been host to a series of major gas, gas condensate and oil discoveries which began with the 1971 discovery at Scott Reef-1 (now called Torosa). The Browse Basin is currently the focus for two proposals to establish new LNG export facilities; one by Woodside Energy Ltd in relation to the Torosa/Brecknock/Calliance complex and the other by Inpex Corporation in relation to the Ichthys complex. Two of the Browse Joint Venture permits are presently lightly explored. There is one well on the boundary of WA-332-P (Prudhoe-1), one well in WA-333-P (Rob Roy-1), and a total of fourteen wells in WA-342-P, mostly associated with the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation.
On April 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Alpha Oil & Natural Gas Pty Ltd (“Alpha”), a transaction entered into on July 1, 2004. The acquisition of Alpha was made in order to acquire a 20% interest in the Browse Joint Venture, being permits, WA-332-P, WA-333-P, WA-341-P and WA-342-P. Following signing of this transaction, but prior to the agreement between being finalized, Alpha (with the approval of AOGC) sold its 20% interest in WA-341-P to a third party for an amount in excess of book value. The settlement funds received by Alpha were incorporated in funds available to AOGC, through this wholly owned subsidiary, following completion of the Alpha purchase.
The now remaining three permits within the Browse Basin, WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P, are contiguous and are located offshore in the eastern Browse Basin. They cover a total area of 9,460 km² (2,336,620 acres).
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha, together with its joint venturers, in 2008 entered into a farmout agreement with respect to WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P (“Permits”) with Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd (“Gascorp”) whereby Gascorp agreed to earn a 15% interest in each of the three Permits in return for Gascorp expending $1,120,000 in acquiring approximately 490 line kilometres of new 2D seismic data (the Braveheart 2D survey) in the Permits and in acquiring a drill site survey in order to determine a specific well location from which to test the Braveheart prospect. The seismic surveys provided further coverage of the Braveheart Prospect as well as coverage of leads within WA-332-P. As a result of this farmout, Alpha’s interest in each of the three permits reduced from 20% to 17%.
Separate new operating agreements were entered into for WA-332-P and WA-333-P (Braveheart) and WA-342-P (Cornea).
Braveheart Joint Venture - WA-332-P and WA-333-P
In the first three year term of these permits, the Joint Venture obtained available open file reports and basic 2D and 3D seismic data acquired by the earlier efforts of previous explorers. We also acquired reprocessed 2D seismic data. The pre-existing 2D seismic data sets have been integrated with the acquisition and processing by the Joint Venture of the Braveheart 2D seismic survey of approximately 1,949 line km of new 2D seismic survey over these permits. This survey has recently been infilled with a further 490 kms of 2D seismic. The Braveheart Joint Venture elected to enter a second three year permit term in which it has planned for the drilling of Braveheart 1 in WA-333-P.
On April 3, 2009 the Browse Joint Venture was granted an 18-months suspension and extension of Year 5 of permit WA-332-P and WA-333-P in order to acquire further new infill 2D seismic survey over potential leads in WA-332-P and to secure a drilling vessel. Year 5 of WA-332-P ends March 31, 2010. Further extensions may be necessary.
On April 3, 2009 the Browse Joint Venture was also granted a 12-month suspension and extension of Year 5 of the WA-333-P permit in order to allow additional time for the drilling of the Braveheart-1 well in WA-333-P. The Joint Venture entered into a contract with a drilling vessel management company, as a result of which the Braveheart-1 well commenced drilling on the Braveheart feature in late 2009. Year-5 of WA-333-P ends on March 31, 2010.
The participants in each of the WA-332-P and WA-333-P permits formed new 100% owned subsidiary companies and transferred their respective interests in the Braveheart Joint Venture to such wholly owned subsidiaries. Alpha incorporated Braveheart Oil & Gas Pty Ltd as a wholly owned subsidiary to which it has assigned its residual 17% interest in each of these Permits. The Joint Venture adopted the new name of the “Braveheart Joint Venture” and entered into a new joint venture operating agreement on 21 October 2009 and confirmed the appointment of Hawkestone Oil Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Exoil Limited) as operator.
The participants had previously farmed out a further 12.5% interest in the Braveheart Permits to Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd in return for that company meeting all of the costs for the planning services of Australian Drilling Associates Pty Ltd in the lead up to drilling Braveheart-1.
These two permits are held by the Braveheart Joint Venture, consisting of the following parties:
Moby Oil & Gas Limited 26.4375%
Braveheart Resources Pty Ltd
(subsidiary of Exoil Limited)
25.3750%
Browse Petroleum Pty Ltd
(subsidiary of Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd)
20.1875%

Braveheart Energy Pty Ltd
(subsidiary of Goldsborough Limited)
7.2500%
Braveheart Petroleum Pty Ltd
(subsidiary of Batavia Oil & Gas Pty Ltd)
6.2500%
The Operator of the Braveheart Joint Venture is Hawkestone.
Between the December 29, 2009 and (post the end of the year) the January 18, 2010, the Braveheart-1 exploration well was drilled into the Braveheart Prospect by the Songa Venus semi-submersible rig from a location within WA-333-P. The Braveheart Prospect straddled the two permits.
During the course of drilling operations on January 13, 2010, the well penetrated the targeted Lower M.australis sandstone. After the conduct and analysis of wireline logging operations, it was established that the targeted sandstone interval extended over a gross interval of 30 metres. Within that gross sandstone interval there were net porous sands of 22.7 metres, estimated as having an average total porosity of 28.7% - see figure below entitled “M.australis sandstone interval in Braveheart-1”.
While there was some evidence of residual hydrocarbons at the top of the reservoir interval, most of the cleaner sands were water filled. While this result was disappointing, the well results have validated the depositional model relied upon to support the presence of a high quality reservoir interval at the Braveheart Prospect.
Steps were taken to complete the conduct of further data gathering actions after which the well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
Cornea Joint Venture - WA-342-P
The Cornea Joint Venture comprises the interests held in WA-342-P, which is adjacent to WA-332-P and WA-333-P.
On October 22, 2007, the Joint Venture lodged a request for a variation of the permit WA-342-P so that, instead of drilling a well in Year-5, the permit would require geotechnical studies, while Year-6 of the permit would require reprocessing 1000 kms² of the existing 3D seismic data set. Such variation of the permit has been granted, with Year-6 of the permit commencing on November 28, 2009.
The joint venture has carried out extensive studies as to prospectivity of the known Cornea gas/oil accumulation, where it is postulated that there is scope for recovery of prospective resources of between 40 million and 90 million barrels of oil, if our geological concepts and assumptions are correct. However, the challenges at Cornea include a low permeability reservoir with difficult to model production characteristics and the long, narrow shape of the field.
This permit is held by the Cornea Joint Venture consisting of the following parties.
Moby Oil & Gas Limited 22.375%
Cornea Oil & Gas Pty Ltd
(subsidiary of Australian Oil & Gas Corporation)
17.000%

The Operator of the Cornea Joint Venture is Exoil’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hawkestone Oil Pty Ltd (“Hawkestone”).
The Cornea Joint Venture engaged the services of Australian Drilling Associates Pty Ltd to provide project management services to support the conduct of Cornea-3 appraisal drilling operations and took by assignment a drilling slot in a group sponsored multi-well program utilising the semi-submersible drilling rig, the Songa Venus.
Between the 11th and 28th of December 2009, the Cornea-3 appraisal/exploration well was drilled into the known Cornea oil and gas accumulation by the Songa Venus semi-submersible rig
Late on 24 December 2009 the Cornea-3 well penetrated the targeted Middle Albian and Lower Jamieson Formation B and C sand reservoir interval, 2.2 metres deeper than predicted, but, as planned, just below the predicted gas oil contact. The well was then deepened to penetrate exploration targets in the Early Albian and Aptian of the Lower Heywood Formation before terminating at a total depth of 910.6 metres (measured depth below rotary table or MDRT). The data obtained while drilling indicated the intersection of a hydrocarbon bearing column in the Middle Albian, Lower Jamieson Formation. The exploration targets in the Lower Heywood Formation did not contain hydrocarbons.
The objectives of the Cornea-3 well were to define the location of hydrocarbon contacts and to obtain data relating to the potential reservoir qualities of the Middle Albian and Lower Jamieson Formation.
Following the conclusion of drilling, a series of logs were run, including a Magnetic Resonance log, as conventional logging tools are unable to resolve the reservoir properties due to the glauconitic nature of the rocks. In addition, a wireline formation tester was run to assess the pressure within the reservoir and to take fluid samples.
The results of drilling and logging can be summarised as follows.
1. An oil column of 20.4m was intersected between the gas oil contact at 785.6m MDRT and the free water level (as defined by pressure data) at 806m MDRT. The logging has established a clear oil and water gradient - a significant improvement on the position known before the well was drilled. This will better enable the assessment of the aggregate quantity of hydrocarbons across the greater Cornea feature.
2. Extensive efforts were made to sample the oil, but the unconsolidated nature of the reservoir meant that, on every attempt, the test MDT tools became blocked with sand preventing fluid sampling. The failure to recover fluid samples was somewhat disappointing, but oil samples had been obtained by the previous operator.
3. A considerable number of pressure testing results were obtained which enabled the establishment of oil and water gradients and hydrocarbon contacts.
4. The condition of the hole through the hydrocarbon bearing section was excellent and enabled the recovery of high quality log data from the Magnetic Resonance tool. These data are now being analysed to deduce reservoir porosity, permeability, water saturation and oil viscosity.
Overall, the results of Cornea-3 have, for the first time, clearly defined the location of an oil column. As already noted, the condition of the hole through the reservoir section was excellent. A great deal has been learned about how future wells can be drilled in the greater Cornea feature. This has given the Cornea Joint Venture confidence about the ability to drill subsequent horizontal wells through the reservoir section.
Looking forward, the data obtained from Cornea-3 will enable the Cornea Joint Venture to formulate a future exploration, appraisal and development strategy now that an oil column has been proved and that good data relating to the potential reservoir performance has been obtained.
Following the logging, Cornea-3 was plugged and abandoned as planned. The Songa Venus rig was then towed to the Braveheart-1 location in WA-333-P where that well was spudded on 29 December 2009 - refer to immediately preceding section.
BONAPARTE BASIN INTERESTS, OFFSHORE FROM THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA - NT/P62, NT/P63, NT/P64, NT/P65, NT/P70, NT/P71, NT/P72 and NT/P73
The Timor Sea covers a huge area underlain by the Bonaparte sedimentary basin made up of various geological segments, with potential for new hydrocarbon discoveries. The region has a long history of exploration activity and discovery and has become a focus for domestic and international petroleum exploration and development activities. There have been numerous oil, gas/condensate and gas discoveries to the north west in the region of the permits, including the Laminaria, Corallina and Bayu-Undan fields. The giant gas fields of Greater Sunrise, Evans Shoal, Caldita and Barossa are to the north and east of the permits. Recent Plover Formation discoveries have been made in the Heron-2 well and the Blackwood-1 well, in permit NT/P68 immediately north of NT/P63 and immediately south of NT/P65.
The Timor Sea is a major emerging petroleum province, with a developing emphasis in gas processing for the export market. Discoveries made over the past few years are expected to lead to the area providing substantial gas production and revenue, through value-added gas projects covering a range of gas to liquids processes and technologies.
National Gas Consortium - NT/P62, NT/P63, NT/P64, NT/P65, NT/P71 and NT/P72
On April 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Nations Natural Gas Pty Ltd (Nations). The acquisition of Nations was entered into on September 10, 2004 and made in order to acquire a 30% interest in the initial four permits of the National Gas Consortium, being permits, NT/P62, NT/P63, NT/P64 and NT/P65 (“Timor Sea Permits”), located in the Australian sector of the Timor Sea, offshore from the Northern Territory.
Nations, on June 15, 2006, agreed to farmout 6% of its 30% interest in each of the Timor Sea Permits to NGA (leaving Nations with a net 24% interest) in return for the acquisition and funding by NGA of Nations 30% share of the new Sunshine 2D seismic survey (887 kms) and Kurrajong 2D seismic survey (3,291 km), which were acquired in November 2006.
Nations, on June 16, 2008, agreed to a further farmout of 3% of its 24% interest in each of the Timor Sea Permits to NGA (leaving Nations with a net 21% interest) in return for expenditure of AUD$1.6 million by NGA on Joint Venture exploration costs. The cost of the Company’s share of the Sunshine and Kurrajong surveys was met entirely by NGA.
On August 8, 2006, Nations, together with the other joint venturers in the National Gas Consortium, were granted petroleum exploration permits NT/P71 and NT/P72 for an initial 6-year term. Permits NT/P71 and NT/P72, which cover a total area of approximately 17,380 km² (4,294,772 acres), are located in the Australian sector of the Timor Sea, and are held by the National Gas Consortium, which holds the contiguous NT/P62, NT/P63 and NT/P64 permits to the immediate west.
The National Gas Consortium then held six permits aggregating approximately 32,255 km² (7,970,533 acres) namely, NT/P62, NT/P63, NT/P64, NT/P65, NT/ P71 and NT/P72, all within jurisdiction of Australia.

Sunshine Joint Venture and Mimosa Joint Venture - NT/P65 and NT/P62
On May 29, 2009, the members of the National Gas Consortium applied for a variation in the permits NT/P62 and NT/P65 where the year 5 well obligation in each permit will be swapped for a seismic interpretation and mapping obligation from year 6.
The obligation to acquire at least 150 km of new 2D seismic data in NT/P62 was met through the completion of the Mimosa 2D survey carried out in March, 2009. Cost of the 2D survey was met by Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd as its farmin obligation.
The obligation to acquire at least 200 km of new 2D seismic data in NT/P65 was met through the completion of the Sunshine Infill 2D survey carried out in March 2009. The cost of the Sunshine survey was met entirely by Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd as its farmin obligation.

Crocodile Joint Venture - Eastern Bonaparte Basin - NT/P70
On October 10, 2005, the Australian Government granted petroleum exploration permit NT/P70, for a 6-year term. The Company initially held a 100% interest in the permit and now holds an 80% interest as the result of farmout (see below).
NT/P70 covers an area of 7,370 km² (1,821,200 acres) and is located in the eastern Timor Sea, about 300 km north of Darwin, and 250 km northeast of the proposed Darwin to Bayu-Undan gas pipeline. The Greater Sunrise, Evans Shoal, Barossa and Caldita gas accumulations are located to the west and southwest of the NT/P70 permit area.
There have been no wells drilled in the permit.
AOGC agreed on June 15, 2006, to farmout 20% of its 100% interest in NT/P70 to NGA in return for the acquisition and funding by NGA of the cost of acquisition of a new 800 line km Crocodile 2D seismic survey in the NT/P70 permit. Subsequently AOGC has agreed to transfer it’s 80% interest to it’s wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha Oil & Natural Gas Pty Ltd.
In NT/P70 we have obtained a range of pertinent existing reports and open file seismic data and, together with the Crocodile 2D seismic data, have mapped, interpreted and revised analyses and concepts for the area. We have decided not to acquire 300 km² of new 3D seismic survey as, from the seismic data we acquired, we have been unable to confirm our initial perceptions of the viability of either the Crocodile feature or the Warawi feature which have been the major focus of our work in NT/P70. They are the only features that we have identified as having any merit.
The NT/P70 permit had previously been offered for farmout, with a number of international companies having considered the acreage without any proposal having been received.
The NT/P70 permit was relinquished during the year.
Stillwater Joint Venture - NT/P73
On March 27, 2007, the Australian Government granted our subsidiary, Alpha, a petroleum exploration permit, NT/P73, for an initial 6-year term. NT/P73 covers an area of 6,815 km² (1,683,300 acres). The Barossa and Caldita gas accumulations are located to the west of the NT/P73 permit area.
In the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the NT/P73 permit we plan to obtain existing reports and open file seismic data and, with this data, to map, interpret and revise analyses and concepts for the area. We are required to acquire up to 2,000 line km of 2D in the third year of the permit. Should we so decide, we can elect to enter the second three years of the initial permit term and drill one exploration well and perform further interpretational work. There have been no wells drilled in the permit area.
Our work to date has focused on the Stillwater feature of the NW corner of NT/P73. We reached agreement with ConocoPhillips with respect to our right to approximately 200 kms² of 3D data acquired by ConocoPhillips in the NW corner of our NT/P73, most of which covers the highly interesting Stillwater feature, which sits en enchelon with the Caldita feature, located in the adjacent permit held by ConocoPhillips and Santos. This data has been expressed in 2D format, exceeding 2000 line kms, thus meeting our third permit-year obligation.
On April 3, 2009 the company’s Australian subsidiary, Alpha Oil and Natural Gas Pty Ltd, sold “information” in the NT/P73 exploration permit to Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd (Gascorp) for $249,935 (AUD$350,000). That information has been used by Gascorp to investigate a proposal to take up to a 35% interest in the permit. Gascorp Australia Pty Ltd is an affiliate company of Mr. EG Albers.
Gascorp had previously advised that it would take up this 35% interest and is in the process of entering into a formal arrangement to do so.
The NT/P73 permit has been offered for farmout.
