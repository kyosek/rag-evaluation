Item 2. Properties
All of the Properties are leased to franchisees of national, regional and local fast food, family style and casual/theme restaurants.
Original lease terms for the majority of the Properties are generally five to twenty years from their inception. All leases are triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating costs including maintenance, repairs, utilities, property taxes, and insurance. A majority of the leases contain percentage rent provisions, which require the tenant to pay a specified percentage (five percent to eight percent) of gross sales above a threshold amount. None of the Properties are mortgaged. The Partnership owns the buildings and land and all improvements for all the Properties, except for the property leased to the franchisee of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant (“KFC”) in Santa Fe, New Mexico. KFC is located on land, where the Partnership has entered into a long-term ground lease, as lessee, which is set to expire in 2018. The Partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods. The Partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land (including the building and improvements) until the termination of the ground lease, at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owner’s property.
The Partnership owned the following Properties as of December 31, 2012:
Footnotes:
(1) Purchase price includes all costs incurred by the Partnership to acquire the property.
(2) The tenant has the option to extend the lease two additional periods of five years each.
(3) The tenant has the option to extend the lease an additional period of five years.
(4) The tenant has the option to extend the lease four additional periods of two years each.
(5) Ownership of lessee’s interest is under a ground lease. The tenant is responsible for payment of all rent obligations under the ground lease.
(6) One of the twelve Properties owned as of December 31, 2012 was leased to Wendcharles II. Since more than 75% of the Partnership’s Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to Wendy’s franchisees the financial status of the tenant may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendcharles II provided it with a copy of its reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011. Those reviewed financial statements are attached to this Annual Report 10-K as Exhibit 99.2.
(7) Six of the twelve Properties owned as of December 31, 2012 were leased to Wendgusta. Since more than 75% of the Partnership’s Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to Wendy’s franchisees, the financial status of the tenant may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendgusta provided it with a copy of its reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011. Those reviewed financial statements are attached to this Annual Report 10-K as Exhibit 99.0.
(8) Two of the twelve Properties owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2012 were leased to Wendcharles I. Since more than 75% of the Partnership’s Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to Wendy’s franchisees, the financial status of the tenant may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendcharles I provided it with a copy of its reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011. Those reviewed financial statements are attached to this Annual Report 10-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The following summarizes significant developments, by property, for properties with such developments.
Vacant Phoenix, AZ Property
The China Super Buffet restaurant ceased operations and vacated the Phoenix, AZ property in late June of 2011. Management had sent a letter of default to the former tenant in June, due to its delinquent May and June of 2011 lease obligations totaling $12,312. Management regained possession of the property in July, and although the former tenant is responsible for lease obligations through its lease end date of January 20, 2013, Management does not anticipate any further rent collections and, therefore, monthly base rent charges of $6,000 per month ceased as of June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, the former tenant’s $18,000 security deposit was applied to the past due amounts and the remaining balance of approximately $5,700 was held by the Partnership as property tax cash escrow. In addition, as of June 30, 2011, the former tenant’s remaining long-term rent receivable balance of $9,000 was removed from the balance sheet as an additional straight-line rent adjustment and its remaining deferred lease commission balance of approximately $7,000 was fully amortized.
The Partnership had been unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for the vacant Phoenix, AZ property, and during the third quarter of 2011, the property was reclassified to properties held for sale upon the late September of 2011 execution of an Agency and Marketing Agreement (“Agreement”) with an unaffiliated Agent. The Agreement gave the Agent the exclusive right to sell the vacant Phoenix, AZ property and the Denny’s, Phoenix, AZ property through auction, sealed bid, hybrid sealed bid, on-line bid or through private negotiations. The vacant, Phoenix, AZ property did not sell at the October 18, 2011 auction. Per the Agreement, the Agent had the right to continue to market the property to potential buyers until the Agreement was set to terminate upon the later of 30 days after the Live Outcry Auction date, or a closing or settlement, if applicable. A marketing fee of approximately $7,700 was paid to the Agent in September of 2011 for the purpose of advertising, marketing and promoting the properties to the buying public. Management continued to market the property to potential buyers.
At June 30, 2011, the Partnership had accrued six months of 2011 estimated property tax totaling $9,000 based on the 2010 actual property tax bills, approximately $3,300 of which was expensed by the Partnership as property tax. Monthly property tax expense and accruals of $1,500 began in July of 2011 for the vacant property. The first installments of the 2011 property tax bills totaled $7,600 in aggregate and were paid in September of 2011, of which $5,700 was paid from the property tax cash escrow held by the Partnership. The second installments of the 2011 property tax bills total $7,600 in aggregate and are due by March 1, 2012. The monthly property tax accrual for the vacant property was adjusted to approximately $1,300 in September of 2011 due to the receipt of the actual 2011 property tax bills related to the property and therefore the property tax payable balance as of December 31, 2011 approximated $7,600.
Due to the vacancy of the Phoenix, AZ property, the Partnership assumed property insurance and maintenance responsibility beginning in July of 2011. The Partnership purchased property insurance amounting to approximately $3,000 for the 2011/2012 policy year during July of 2011, of which $1,200 was expensed during 2011. Maintenance, security and utility expenditures totaling approximately $10,000 were incurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2011. Management anticipates that the Partnership will continue to incur approximately $1,500 per month in security patrol measures at the vacant property.
The carrying amount of the vacant Phoenix, AZ property was reduced by $390,117 during the fiscal year 2011, to its estimated fair value of $150,000. The net book value of the vacant Phoenix, AZ property at December 31, 2011, classified as property held for sale in the condensed financial statements, was approximately $151,700 which included $123,369 related to land , $26,631 related to building, $700 related rents and other receivables, $9,300 related to utilities security deposit, $1,600 related to prepaid insurance, $2,300 related to accounts payable and accrued expenses and $7,600 related to property tax payable.
A contract (“Contract”) to sell the vacant Phoenix, AZ property to an unaffiliated party was executed on February 14, 2012 for the sale price of $325,000. The sale was closed on October 22, 2012, resulting in net cash proceeds of $293,000, after third party commissions and other selling expenses, which is greater than the Property’s estimated fair value of $150,000 as of September 30, 2012. The carrying amount of the property was increased by $142,747 during the fourth quarter of 2012 to reflect the net proceeds of the sale.
Formerly Owned Denny’s Restaurant- Phoenix, AZ Property
A new twenty three month lease for the Denny’s restaurant located in Phoenix, AZ was executed with the tenant, Denny’s #6423, LLC (“Denny’s”) in June of 2009. The lease (which was effective as of June 1, 2009) provided for an annual base rent of $72,000 (less a potential $600 rent credit per month for both timely payment and sales reporting), and was set to expire on April 30, 2011. A commission of approximately $4,000 was paid to a General Partner affiliate in the second quarter of 2009 in relation to the lease. Due to the lease modifications detailed below, approximately $1,200 of the commission paid in 2009 was reimbursed to the Partnership in May of 2011 and is included in other income in the condensed statements of income.
In December of 2009, due to sluggish sales figures, Denny’s notified the General Partner of its intent to terminate its lease early, pursuant to its lease rights, as of March 15, 2010. Responsive to the depressed Phoenix market, during January of 2010, Management and Denny’s agreed to a six month temporary modification to the lease retroactive to January 1, 2010. The tenant’s rent from January of 2010 through June of 2010 was strictly percentage rent at eight percent of monthly sales over $50,000. In June of 2010, an additional temporary lease modification was agreed upon. Denny’s rent from July of 2010 to
September of 2010 was strictly percentage rent at eight percent of monthly sales over $50,000 and the rent from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 was strictly percentage rent at eight percent of monthly sales over $37,500. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, percentage rent income totaling approximately $40,000 was recognized in relation to the property.
The January 1, 2011 third modification to Denny’s lease, allowed for a month-to-month tenant lease as of May 1, 2011. In addition, Denny’s rent, beginning January 1, 2011 and until the sale of the property in November of 2011, was strictly percentage rent at eight percent of monthly sales over $37,500. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, percentage rent income totaling approximately $47,000 was recognized in relation to the property. In addition, eight percent of monthly sales between $27,500 and $37,500 (up to $800) were held in a repair fund reserve by the Partnership, from which the tenant could withdraw for necessary property improvements upon proper proof of expenditures to the Partnership. The $8,000 repair fund reserve balance was credited to the buyer upon the sale of the property on November 23, 2011.
During the third quarter of 2011, the property was reclassified to properties held for sale upon the late September of 2011 execution of an Agency and Marketing Agreement (“Agreement”) with an unaffiliated Agent. The Agreement gave the Agent the exclusive right to sell the Denny’s, Phoenix, AZ property and the vacant Phoenix, AZ property through auction, sealed bid, hybrid sealed bid, on-line bid or through private negotiations. The Agreement was set to terminate upon the later of 30 days after the Live Outcry Auction, or a closing or settlement, if applicable. A marketing fee of approximately $7,700 was paid to the Agent in September of 2011 for the purpose of advertising, marketing and promoting the properties to the buying public
The carrying amount of the Denny’s, Phoenix, AZ property was reduced by $104,705 to its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell of $445,000 during the fiscal year 2011.
A contract to sell the Denny’s, Phoenix, AZ property was executed at the October 18, 2011 auction by an unaffiliated party for the high bid price of $475,000. A five percent buyer’s premium totaling $23,750, which was retained by the Agent per the Marketing Agreement at closing, was added to the high bid price for a total sales price of $498,750 to be paid by the buyer. The buyer provided a ten percent earnest money deposit of $49,870 which was held by an independent escrow company. The Purchase Agreement was accepted and executed by Management on October 20, 2011. Closing occurred on November 23, 2011 and resulted in a fourth quarter loss of approximately $1,000. Closing and other sale related costs paid by the Partnership amounted to approximately $26,000 and included a two percent commission ($9,500) of the high bid price paid to the Agent and an advisory fee of three percent ($14,250) of the high bid price paid to an affiliate of the Partnership.
Wendy’s- 1721 Sam Rittenberg, Charleston, SC
The Sam Rittenberg property lease with tenant, Wencoast, was set to expire on November 6, 2016. On September 4, 2008 the lease was assumed and assigned to Wendcharles I. Per the Assumption and Assignment of Lease agreement, the monetary lease obligations and original lease expiration date remained the same. However, per a Lease Amendment agreement (“Amendment”) with Wendcharles I, dated September 4, 2008, the original lease was extended five (5) years to November 6, 2021 and provided for two options to renew for additional five (5) year periods. On November 17, 2011, per an Assumption and Assignment of Lease agreement, the lease was assumed and assigned to Wendcharles II.
Wendy’s- 361 Highway 17 Bypass, Mt. Pleasant, SC Property
On November 30, 2010, the County of Charleston (the “County”) made a purchase offer (“Initial Offer”) of approximately $177,000 to the Partnership in connection with an eminent domain (condemnation) land acquisition of approximately 5,000 square feet of the approximately 44,000 square feet of the Wendy’s- Mt. Pleasant, SC (“Wendy’s- Mt. Pleasant”) property. The proposed land purchase is for “Right of Way” for planned road improvements. Unfortunately, the plan provides for the relocation of ingress and egress that could make the operations of the Wendy’s restaurant uneconomic.
In October of 2011, the Partnership received Notice (“Condemnation Notice”) that the County filed condemnation proceedings on October 12, 2011, which in effect permits the County to take possession of approximately 5,000 square feet of the Wendy’s- Mt. Pleasant property and to begin construction of the planned road improvements. The County deposited the Initial Offer of $177,000 with the Charleston County Clerk of Court as is required under South Carolina law. The Partnership had until November 11, 2011, to reject the Initial Offer (“Tender of Payment”) for the purchase of the property. The Partnership rejected the Tender of Payment; however, the Initial Offer is still valid during the period the Partnership disputes the County’s position that the $177,000 reflects just compensation for the taking of the property. By and through respective legal counsel, the Partnership and the lessee, Wendcharles I, each filed a Notice of Court Appearance (“Notice of Appearance”) and requested a jury trial in October. In addition, the Partnership and the lessee served one set of joint initial discovery requests (“Interrogatories” and “Requests for Production”) with the County requesting information about and access to up-to-date project plans and any and all other information pertaining to this matter. As the Partnership continues to dispute the Initial Offer as fair value of the land acquisition, mediation between the Partnership and the County was scheduled for February 1, 2013. The County was to have provided an updated appraisal of the taking prior to the mediation date to incorporate the value impact of eliminating one of the two access drives among other unique impacts not previously addressed in the initial appraisal. However, the appraisal was not completed and the February 1, 2013 mediation was cancelled. Mediation was subsequently held on March 15, 2013 with no settlement achieved. The jury trial date is set for the week of March 25, 2013. Our counsel has advised that it is unlikely the trial will occur as scheduled. Management will continue to actively work with legal counsel and Wendcharles I to facilitate a settlement with the County of Charleston and the re-engineering of the County’s plans to preserve the viability of the site for Wendy’s operational use. The net book value of the land to be purchased is $33,991 and was reclassified to a property held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Daytona’s All Sports Café- Des Moines, IA Property
The second amendment to the lease for the Daytona’s All Sports Café (“Daytona’s) located in Des Moines, IA expired on May 31, 2011. In April of 2011, Management and Daytona’s signed a letter of intent (“LOI”) which agreed to a three year lease amendment and extension which was to begin on June 1, 2011 and expire on May 31, 2014. The third amendment to the lease was executed in early May of 2011 and provides for an annual base rent of $72,000, rent abatement for June for each of the three years, and a continued potential $600 rent credit per month for both timely payment and sales reporting. In addition, Daytona’s is to pay as percentage rent 8% of its annual sales over $850,000. During 2010, Daytona’s reported sales to the Partnership of approximately $820,000 (percentage rents were to be charged at six percent over a sales breakpoint of $900,000). A leasing commission of approximately $5,000 was paid in May of 2011 to a General Partner affiliate upon the execution of the third lease amendment and extension.
Beginning in December of 2005, Management requested that Daytona’s escrow its future property tax liabilities with the Partnership on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2012, Daytona’s was current on its monthly rent and property tax escrow obligations. The escrow payments held by the Partnership totaled approximately $25,000 and were included in property tax payable in the Partnership’s condensed balance sheets.
Applebee’s- Columbus, OH Property
An Amendment and Extension of Lease (“Amendment”) was executed with the Applebee’s restaurant occupying the property located in Columbus, OH on November 4, 2009. The Amendment, effective as of November 1, 2009, provides for an annual base rent of $135,996 and was set to expire on October 31, 2012. The Amendment also increased the percentage rent sales breakpoint from $1,500,000 to $2,300,000 and decreased the additional percentage rent from 7% to 5%.
The Partnership waived the current 90 day notice period and allowed the tenant to exercise the first option to renew its lease for an additional two year period, effective November 1, 2012. The base rent increases to $138,716 in the first year of the renewal period and to $141,490 in the second year. There are four remaining options to renew the lease for an additional two years, with the base rent to increase by 2% for each year of each option. The percentage rent breakpoint does not change.
Formerly Owned and Vacant Park Forest, IL Property
The Partnership had been unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for the vacant Park Forest, IL (“Park Forest”) property and, as of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of this property was written down to $0.
In November of 2010, a Purchase Contract was executed for the sale of the Park Forest property to an unaffiliated party for a selling price of $10,000. The closing date of the sale was December 2, 2010, and a net gain on the sale of approximately $7,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Closing and other sale related costs amounted to approximately $3,000 and included a $1,000 sales commission paid to an unaffiliated Broker Agent. In addition, the Partnership paid approximately $2,000 at the closing for past due water bills related to the former tenant of the Park Forest property. Per the terms of the Purchase Contract, the Partnership was responsible for paying the 2010 property tax for the Park Forest property which will be due in 2011 to the Cook County taxing authority. At the closing, the buyer paid approximately $2,000 to the Partnership for its one month share of the 2010 property tax.
As of December 31, 2010, the Partnership had accrued and expensed eleven months of estimated 2010 property tax totaling approximately $20,000 and held one month property tax cash escrow of approximately $2,000 from the buyer of the property. The first installment of 2010 property tax, totaling approximately $12,000 was paid in February of 2011 and the second installment of 2010 property tax, totaling approximately $10,000 was paid in October of 2011.
Formerly Owned Panda Buffet Restaurant- Grand Forks, ND Property
A sales contract was executed on September 30, 2009 for the installment sale of the Panda Buffet restaurant property (“Panda Buffet”) located in Grand Forks, ND to the owner tenant. The Partnership completed the sale of the Panda Buffet property on November 12, 2009 for $450,000. The buyer paid $150,000 at closing with the remaining balance of $300,000 being delivered in the form of a Promissory note (“Buyers Note”) to the Partnership. The Buyers Note reflected a term of three years, an interest rate of 7.25%, and principal and interest payments paid monthly. Principal was amortized over a period of ten years beginning December 1, 2009 with a balloon payment due on November 1, 2012. Pursuant to the Buyers Note, there will be no penalty for early payment of principal. The Buyers Note also required the buyer to escrow property taxes with the Partnership beginning January of 2010 at $1,050 per month (lowered to $900 beginning February 1, 2011 and $700 beginning January 1, 2012). The Partnership amended the Buyers Note in the amount of $232,777, to $200,000 after a principal payment of $32,777 was received on October 19, 2012 under the following extended terms: The principal balance of $200,000 will be amortized over five years at an interest rate of 7.25% per annum with a full balloon payment of $133,396 due November 1, 2014. As of December 31, 2012, the buyer was current on its 2012 monthly property tax escrow obligations and escrow payments. The property tax escrow cash balance held by the Partnership amounted to $12,600 at December 31, 2010, and in January of 2011,
$10,800 of the property tax escrow was relinquished to the Buyer upon proof of payment of the 2010 property tax to the taxing authority. The property tax escrow cash balance held by the Partnership amounted to approximately $2,000 at December 31, 2011, after the $10,800 payment of the 2011 property tax to the taxing authority by the Partnership in October of 2011. The property tax escrow cash balance held by the Partnership amounted to approximately $150 as December 31, 2012, after the $10,800 payment of the 2012 property taxes in December 2012 and is included in the property tax payable in the condensed balance sheets.
Per the Buyer’s Note amortization schedule, the monthly payments are to total approximately $3,916 per month.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, twelve note payments were received by the Partnership and totaled $55,955 in principal and $17,369 in interest.
Other Property Information
Property taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Partnership’s Properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes vacant (such as Phoenix, AZ property, formerly operated as China Buffet, or the formerly owned vacant Park Forest, IL property), the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property. In a property vacancy the Partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property.
Such taxes, insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Partnership owns one restaurant, which is located on a parcel of land where it has entered into a long-term ground lease, as lessee, which is set to expire in 2018. The Partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods. The Partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land (including the building and improvements) until the termination of the ground lease, at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owner’s property. The tenant, KFC, is responsible for the $3,400 per month ground lease payment per the terms of its lease with the Partnership.
