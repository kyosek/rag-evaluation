THE PERCENTAGE LEASES
In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Partnership can operate hotels. Therefore, the Company and the Partnership lease the Current Hotels for terms of ten years pursuant to Percentage Leases, which provide for rent equal to the greater of Base Rent or Percentage Rent. Other than the franchise licenses for the Current Hotels and working capital sufficient to operate the Current Hotels, the Lessee has only nominal assets in addition to its rights and benefits under the Percentage Leases. The Percentage Leases for the Current Hotels contain the provisions described below. The Company intends that future leases with respect to its hotel property investments will contain substantially similar provisions, although the Company's Board of Directors may, in its discretion, alter any of these provisions with respect to any particular lease, depending on the purchase price paid, economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant at the time.
Percentage Lease Terms. Each Percentage Lease for the Current Hotels has a non-cancelable term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the Percentage Lease.
Amounts Payable Under the Percentage Leases. During the term of each Percentage Lease, the Lessee is or will be obligated to pay (i) the greater of Base Rent or Percentage Rent (collectively, the "Rent") and (ii) certain other additional charges. Base Rent accrues and is required to be paid monthly. Percentage Rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues for each of the hotels. Percentage Rent is due quarterly. However, with respect to eleven of the Current Hotels, the Lessee will not be in default for non-payment of Percentage Rent due in any calendar year if the Lessee pays, within 90 days of the end of the calendar year, the excess of Percentage Rent due and unpaid over the Base Rent paid by the Lessee with respect to such year. With respect to the other Current Hotels, the Lessee will not be in default for the non-payment of Percentage Rent if it pays, within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter, the excess of Percentage Rent due and unpaid over the Base Rent paid year-to-date with respect to such quarter.
Beginning in the calendar year following the year in which most Percentage Leases commence, and for each year thereafter, (i) the annual Base Rent and (ii) the Percentage Rent formulas will be adjusted for inflation, based on quarterly changes in the CPI. The adjustment in any quarter may not exceed 2%, which may be less than the change in CPI for the quarter.
Other than real estate and personal property taxes, casualty insurance, capital improvements and maintenance of underground utilities and structural elements, which are obligations of the Company, the Percentage Leases require the Lessee to pay rent, insurance, all costs and expenses and all utility and other charges incurred in the operation of the Current Hotels. The Percentage Leases also provide for rent reductions and abatements in the event of damage to or destruction or a partial taking of any Current Hotel.
Maintenance and Modifications. Under the Percentage Leases, the Company is required to maintain the underground utilities and the structural elements of the improvements, including exterior walls (excluding plate glass) and the roof of such Current Hotel. In addition, the Percentage Leases obligate the Company to fund periodic capital improvements (in addition to maintenance of underground utilities and structural elements) to the buildings and grounds comprising their respective Current Hotels, and the periodic repair, replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment in their respective Current Hotels, when and as deemed necessary by the Lessee, up to an amount equal to 5% of room revenues for limited-service, and 7% of room revenues and food and beverage revenue for full-service hotels. These obligations will be carried forward to the extent that the Lessee has not expended such amounts, and any unexpended amounts will remain the property of the Company upon termination of the Percentage Leases. Except for capital improvements and maintenance of structural elements and underground utilities, the Lessee will be required, at its expense, to maintain the Current Hotels in good order and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, and to make non-structural, foreseen and unforeseen, and ordinary and extraordinary, repairs which may be necessary and appropriate to keep the Current Hotels in good order and repair.
The Lessee is not obligated to bear the cost of capital improvements to the Current Hotels. With the consent of the Company, however, the Lessee, at its expense, may make non-capital and capital additions, modifications or improvements to the Current Hotels, provided that such action does not significantly alter the character or purposes of the Current Hotels or significantly detract from the value or operating efficiencies of the Current Hotels. All such alterations, replacements and improvements shall be subject to all the terms and provisions of the Percentage Leases and will become the property of the Company upon termination of the Percentage Leases. The Company owns or will own substantially all personal property (other than inventory, liens and other nondepreciable personal property) not affixed to, or deemed a part of, the real estate or improvements thereon comprising their respective Current Hotels, except to the extent that ownership of such personal property would cause the rents under the Percentage Leases not to qualify as "rents from real property" for REIT income test purposes.
