Item 2. Properties for a description of the foreclosure.
On September 9, 1993, St. James Limited Partnership ("SJLP"), a limited partnership in which the Registrant owns a 98% interest, filed a reorganization petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. After filing the petition, it became apparent that there could not be a confirmable plan of reorganization without either the Registrant making an additional equity contribution to SJLP or an extremely favorable settlement of a complaint by the Registrant against the Registrant's co-general partner in SJLP and United National Bank alleging misappropriation of funds from a deficit cash reserve account. See Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Since the Registrant had no additional sources of equity and the outcome of the co-general partner/bank suit was uncertain, the automatic stay was lifted and the first mortgage holder foreclosed on the property on October 21, 1994.
On August 14, 1992, Commercial Federal Realty Investors Corporation ("CFRIC"), the owner of a 1% interest in the Saunders Apartments Joint Venture ("SAJV") filed an action in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska seeking damages of $275,000 plus interest alleged to be due under the terms of various agreements between parties which were executed in connection with the establishment of the joint venture. The Registrant denied liability and filed a counterclaim seeking declaratory judgment and money damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. On June 1, 1993, a settlement agreement was reached and an Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement was reached whereby the Registrant was entitled to retain all funds held in escrow ($275,000) pursuant to the original joint venture agreement. In return, CFRIC agreed to convert $1,155,000 in amounts owed to it by SAJV to a capital contribution, (increasing its ownership in SAJV to 70%) and will receive 100% of future income, losses and tax credits for tax purposes until such time as it recovers $430,000 of the capital contribution, any advances it must make on behalf of the property in the form of loan reduction and cash flow shortfalls (with interest at 10%), and any amounts resulting from any recapture of tax credits. Thereafter, future income and losses for both book and tax purposes will be allocated 70% to CFRIC and 30% to the Registrant.

c. Narrative Description of Business
Registrant is in the business of operating, holding, selling, exchanging and otherwise dealing in and with real properties containing improvements which are "Certified Historic Structures," as such term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), or which are eligible for designation as such, for use as apartments, offices, hotels and commercial spaces, or any combination thereof, or low income housing eligible for the tax credit provided by Section 42 of the Code, and such other uses as the Registrant's general partner may deem appropriate.
Since the Registrant's inception, all the properties acquired either by the Registrant, or the subsidiary partnerships in which it has an interest, have been rehabilitated and certified as Historic Structures and have received the related Investment Tax Credit. In addition, four properties (Roseland, Mater Dolorosa, Strehlow Terrace and Saunders Apartments) are low-income housing structures which qualify for, have received, and will continue to receive, the Low Income Tax Credits. Each of the six properties currently owned are held for rental operations. At this time it is anticipated that all the properties will continue to be held for this purpose. At such time as real property values begin to increase, the Registrant will re-evaluate its investment strategy regarding the properties.
As of December 31, 1996, Registrant owned interests in seven properties, located in Nebraska (three), North Carolina (one), Virginia (one), Pennsylvania (one), and Louisiana (one). In total, the properties contain 178 apartment units, 149 condominium units used as rental units, and 50,815 square feet ("sf") of commercial/retail space. As of December 31, 1996, 315 of the apartment and condominium units were under lease (97%) at monthly rental rates ranging from $275 to $1,200. In addition, 41,642 sf of commercial/retail space was under lease (82%) at annual rates ranging from $1.58 to $22.61 per sf. The property located in North Carolina, which consists of 78 condominium units and 6,700 sf of commercial space, was foreclosed in March 1997. Rental of the apartments and commercial space is not expected to be seasonal. For a further discussion of the properties, see Item 2. Properties.
The Registrant is affected by and subject to the general competitive conditions of the residential and commercial real estate industry. As a result of the overbuilding that occurred in the 1980's, the competition for both residential and commercial tenants in the local markets where the Registrant's properties are located is generally strong. In each of the markets, there are several similar historically certified rehabilitated buildings. Two of the properties held for rental are market-rate properties and are located in Alexandria, Virginia, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At these properties the Registrant is forced to keep its rent levels competitively low in order to maintain moderate to high occupancy levels. Management of each of these properties makes frequent market analyses in order to set rent levels. When occupancy nears the 97-99% range, management considers raising the rents by more than a normal cost of living increase. If occupancy falls below 85%, management considers lowering rents. Four of the properties held for rental are low-income housing structures and are located in Omaha, Nebraska, and New Orleans, Louisiana. These properties have fixed rental rates and face competition for low to moderate income tenants from other low income properties in the area. However, there is no organization which holds a dominant position in the residential housing or commercial leasing market in any of the geographic areas in which the Registrant's properties are located.
Registrant has no employees. Registrant's activities are overseen by Brandywine Construction & Management, Inc., ("BCMI") a real estate management firm.

Item 2. Properties
As of December 31, 1996, Registrant owned interests in six partnerships which each own one property and a minority interest in an additional partnership which owns one property. A summary description of each property is given below.
a. Locke Mill Plaza - consists of 78 residential condominium units and 6,700 sf of commercial/retail space in a 185 condominium unit project located at Buffalo Avenue and Union Street in North Concord, North Carolina. An affiliate of the Registrant owns an additional 10 units. In December 1988, Registrant acquired the units for $5,042,000, ($65.44 per sf) which was funded by Registrant's equity contribution and two $1,250,000 notes payable. In recent years, cash flow has not been sufficient to cover operating expenses (including real estate taxes) and debt service, including principal amortization. In order to ease the debt service payment burden on the property, the Registrant discussed with its two lenders the possibility of restructuring its loan obligations. These discussions were not successful. In January 1994, the property's ad valorem property tax payments were in default and the taxing authorities commenced proceedings to sell the property. Since the property was unable to satisfy past due obligations and meet the demands of its secured creditors, on February 14, 1994, Locke Mill Partners ("LMP", the partnership to which the property was transferred on January 21, 1994) filed a reorganization petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 6, 1995, LMP filed the Second Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") and the Plan was confirmed in August 1995. The Plan provided for the following : (1) the sale of some or all of the units to satisfy the claims of its creditors; and (2) an extension of the maturity date of the notes payable for three years, with the option to extend for an additional two years if at least fifty percent (50%) of the principal amount of the debt outstanding at the confirmation of the Plan has been repaid. The net proceeds of the sales will be used to retire the principal balance of the debt. At December 31, 1996 none of the units have been sold. A new lender has placed a wrap-around mortgage on the property in the amount of $3,500,000 (principal balance of $3,649,988 at December 31, 1996) and has agreed to fund the necessary costs for the marketing of the units and any improvements to the units. The wrap-around mortgage amount is supported by a current appraisal of the property, therefore the difference between the wrap-around mortgage and the underlying mortgages was accounted for as an adjustment to the related fixed assets. Monthly payments of interest to the new lender are to be made in an amount equal to net operating income, with a minimum of $25,000 per month. The note accrues interest at 12% and is due in August 2000. On March 14, 1997, the Registrant was declared in default on the first mortgage for failure to make the minimum monthly payment. On March 31, 1997, a settlement agreement was reached whereby the Registrant has agreed to relinquish its partnership interests in LMP. The property is managed by BCMI. As of December 31, 1996, 75 units were under lease (96%) with monthly rents ranging from $435 to $630 and 5,283 sf of commercial space were leased (79%) at annual rents ranging from $1.58 to $4.24 per sf.
All residential leases are renewable, one-year leases. The occupancy for the residential units for the previous four years was 94% for 1995, 93% for 1994, 96% for 1993 and 94% for 1992. The monthly rental range has been approximately the same since 1992. The occupancy for the commercial space was 78% for 1995, 46% for 1994, 46% for 1993 and 41% for 1992. The average annual rent has been $1.45 to $3.16 per sf in 1995, $2.07 per sf in 1994, $5.10 to $6.75 per sf for 1993 and $5.85 per sf for 1992. There are four tenants who each occupy ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. They operate principally as a photographic studio, modeling agency, leasing office and a maintenance shop. The leasing office and maintenance shop each have month to month leases which require sixty (60) days notice to vacate. All leases are operating leases and the minimum future rentals on the noncancelable leases as of December 31, 1996 are $12,654. There are no contingent liabilities included in income for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994.
The following is a table showing commercial lease expirations at Locke Mill Plaza for the next five years.
Total annual % of gross Number of Total sf of rental covered by annual rental leases expiring expiring leases expiring leases from property
1997 1 2,000 $3,150 <1% 1998 0 0 0 0 1999 1 1,275 5,400 <1% 2000 0 0 0 0 2001 0 0 0 0 Thereafter 0 0 0 0
Although no firm commitments have been made, the Registrant anticipates the lease which is scheduled to expire in 1997 will be extended for at least an additional year, due to the long- standing tenancy of the merchant and the availability of a renewal option under its lease.
For tax purposes, this property has a basis of $6,693,007 and is depreciated using the straight-line method with a useful life of 27.5 years. The annual real estate taxes are $36,535 which is based on an assessed value of $3,479,550 taxed at a rate of $.46 per $100 by the City of Concord and a rate of $.62 per $100 by the County of Cabarrus. It is the opinion of the management of the Registrant that the property is adequately covered by insurance.
b. Firehouse Square - consists of 32,544 sf of commercial space at 902-910 King Street in Alexandria, Virginia. In December 1988, Registrant was admitted, with a 90% general partner interest, to Firehouse Square General Partnership ("FSGP"), a Virginia general partnership, for a cash capital contribution of $1,750,000. FSGP acquired and rehabilitated the property for $5,660,000 ($151.51 per sf), funded by the equity contribution and a mortgage note payable of $4,207,000. On June 1, 1993, the first mortgage was modified. The terms of the modification include the addition of all accrued and unpaid interest ($218,728) to the principal balance and revising the payment terms. The lender also advanced $40,711 for real estate taxes and $33,627 for tenant improvements. Monthly payments of interest to the new note holder were to be made in an amount equal to net operating income. The note accrues interest at prime plus 1/2% (8.75% and 9% at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively). On November 16, 1994, the new first mortgage holder foreclosed upon its mortgage. By "credit bidding" its mortgage, the mortgage holder became the successful bidder at sale. The first mortgage holder sold its successful bid to a partnership known as 901 King Street Associates ("KSA"). KSA is a general partnership owned 90% by DHI-VI. The selling price of the mortgage was the amount that the mortgage had been immediately prior to foreclosure. The obligation has terms materially the same as the original mortgage loan and is secured by a new mortgage on the Property. Therefore, after the sale, the Registrant's interest in the Property is unchanged. The principal balance of the mortgage at December 31, 1996 was $4,239,795. The entire principal balance is due October 1998. In June 1995, the Registrant refinanced $900,000 of the first mortgage (principal balance of $887,140 at December 31, 1996). The new loan bears interest at 9.75%, payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of $8,021 and is due in June 2005. The property is managed by BCMI. As of December 31, 1996, Firehouse Square has 25,768 sf of space under lease (82%) at annual rates ranging from $7.00 to $20.55 per sf.
The occupancy for the previous four years was 89% for 1995, 88% for 1994, 87% for 1993 and 53% for 1992. The average annual rent has been $6.57 to $26.96 per sf for 1995, $6.50 to $19.29 per sf for 1994, $6.50 to $30.18 per sf for 1993 and $19.78 per sf for 1992. There are two tenants who each occupy ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. They operate principally as a law firm and an architectural firm. All leases are operating leases and the minimum future rentals on the noncancelable leases as of December 31, 1996 are $386,990. There are no contingent liabilities included in income for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994.

e. Strehlow Terrace Apartments - consists of 70 low income apartment units located at 2024 North 16th Street, Omaha, Nebraska. In January 1989, Registrant was admitted with a 98% general partner interest to Strehlow Terrace Apartments Limited Partnership ("STALP"), a Nebraska limited partnership, for a cash capital contribution of $2,250,000.

In August 1993, six units were damaged by a fire at Strehlow Terrace. Due to the financial difficulties caused by the fire, STALP fell behind on its monthly debt service by several months. Although the property was able to reduce the arrearage by 50% and commenced regular, monthly payments by May 1994, the loan was declared in default and was assigned by GNMA to the Federal Housing Administration/Housing and Urban Development ("FHA/HUD"), on June 24, 1994.

In February 1989, Registrant was admitted to Canal House Historic Associates ("CHHA"), a Pennsylvania limited partnership with a 99% general partner interest for a cash contribution of $6,000,000. During 1990, Registrant made an additional cash contribution of $200,000. (The 1% limited partnership interest is also controlled by Registrant; it is held by a Pennsylvania corporation whose stock is owned by Registrant).
