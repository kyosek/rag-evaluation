Item 2. Properties
Comstock Lode Project
Location, Access, and Title to the Property
We own the following mineral exploration projects: The Comstock gold and silver exploration and test mining project and the Como mineral Claims. The Comstock project is located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada. The Plum property is physically situated roughly three miles south of Virginia City, Nevada. Paved state highways from Reno, Carson City, and Virginia City provide access to the property. The Como mineral Claims are located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles east of Carson City, and have not been explored or developed by us.
OCCIDENTAL LEASE:
Our property rights to the mineral properties consist of several mineral leases, unpatented mineral claims, and fee ownership of real property. We have a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with Claire Obester, Jim Obester, Alan Obester, and Julian Smith dated May 1, 2008 covering mineral rights to six patented claims located in Storey County. The lease remains in effect for 15 years as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We agree to spend $100,000.00 on drilling and associated costs within the first 36 months of the term. We agree to pay $10,000.00 upon execution of the lease. We pay a monthly rent to the lessor of $500 per month beginning April 2009 during the Exploration Term. During the Development Term we pay a royalty of $1000 a month or a royalty percentage on the amount received by us on the sale of the mineral products less the costs incurred for marketing, distribution, processing and sales, commonly referred to as a Net Smelter Return. The royalty percentage varies based on the price of gold: 2% if gold is less than $501 per ounce, 3% if gold is at least $501 per ounce but less than $801 per ounce, 4% if gold is at least $801 per ounce but less than $901 per ounce, 5% if gold is at least $901 per ounce but less than $1001, 6% if gold is at least $1001 per ounce but less than $1101 per ounce, 7% if gold is at least $1101 per ounce but less than $1201 per ounce, 8% if gold is at least $1201 per ounce but less than $1301 per ounce, 9 % if gold is at least $1301 per ounce but less than $1401 per ounce and 10% if gold is $1401 per ounce or greater. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.

In addition to the mineral leases, we hold 100 unpatented mineral claims in Storey County, hold eight unpatented mineral claims in Lyon County, and own title to 40 acres of land in Storey County. The W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust has a lien against and a security interest in these unpatented mineral claims and the 40 acres of land pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated October 31, 2003, entered into with W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust. The Deed of Trust was granted to secure a promissory note, dated October 31, 2003, in the amount of $1 million for the balance of the purchase price for the property. The non-interest bearing promissory note requires ten quarterly payments of $100,000 each. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance of the note was $250,000. In 2007, Winfield’s affiliates, Intergroup Corporation, Santa Fe Financial and Portsmouth Square, purchased the note from the W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust.

Present Condition of Property and Work Performed
We have not completed extensive characterization of mineralized material, geologic analysis, metallurgical testing, mine planning, or economic analysis on the Plum mineral assets. We have not established reserves on this property. Therefore, any activity we perform on the property is considered exploratory in nature. Part of our exploration includes operating a test mine. The purpose of the test mine is to determine our capital and operating costs, metallurgical recoveries, and other mining factors, and demonstrate that we can make a profit over and above our capital and operating costs.
Description of Equipment and other Infrastructure Facilities
Up until the shutdown in mining in February 2007, GoldSpring used a mining contractor to dig material from the Billie the Kid pit. The contractor used 50 ton Euclid haul trucks to haul the mineralized materials from the Billie the Kid/Lucerne open pit to the crushing and process facility located in the northeast corner of the property. The mineralized material is crushed, and agglomerated in a self-contained portable crushing plant. The mineralized material is fed to a vibrating plate feeder by a front-end loader. The feeder provides a steady feed to a Pioneer jaw crusher where material is crushed to -3” minus. Prior to agglomeration, 10 pounds of Type II Portland Cement is added for every ton of mineralized material and metered on to the pug mill feed conveyor which is then transported to the leach pads. A dilute cyanide solution is then applied to the mineralized material on the leach pads. Pregnant solution is accumulated from the leach pad and is then pumped to the 300 gpm Merrill-Crowe recovery plant. The resulting zinc precipitate collected in the presses is dried and smelted on the property using an electric furnace to produce gold ore.
Our third-party contract mining company owns and provided the haul trucks, front end shovel, loaders and blade. We own the Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant, the agglomerator, crushers, screen, water truck, generators, dozers, cement silo with a screw feeder, and conveyors. The Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant and the mineral processing equipment are less than four years old. The total book value of our equipment associated with the Billie the Kid and the Lucerne facilities is approximately $330,000.
Power Utilization at the Plum Property:
We completed the installation of the grid power line replacing a Caterpillar 3516 (1000 kilowatt) diesel generator. The change has reduced our crushing costs and directly attributed to expanding our permit for tons crushed.
Geology, Structure and Mineralization
Several large low angle brecciate structural zones (faults) dominate the geology of the Billie the Kid/Lucerne deposit. The thickness of these structural zones ranges from 20 to 30 feet. Gold mineralization within the Billie the Kid/Lucerne deposit is closely associated with dikes and sills that are composed of Alta Andesite, a dark-colored, fine-grained volcanic rock, but these rocks are rarely or weakly mineralized. Hartford Rhyolite, a fine-grained volcanic rock, hosts approximately 70% to 80% of the gold mineralization and the remaining 20% to 30% is associated with Alta Andesite.
Mineralized Material
We have not established any proven or probable reserves that meet the requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7. Therefore, all of our activities are considered exploratory in nature. Part of our exploration includes operating a test mine. The purpose of the test mine is to determine our capital and operating costs, metallurgical recoveries, and other mining factors, and demonstrate that we can make a profit over and above our capital and operating cost. These test mining activities will assist us with sufficient data to prepare a formal mine plan and establish reserves.
On June 10, 2008, our third-party engineer, Telesto Nevada, Inc. of Reno, Nevada, released the Preliminary Resource Report for our Comstock Project based 450 drill holes from prior drill campaigns and 38 drill holes that we completed as of the date of the report. The third-party Report indicated a resource of 4,926,000 tons grading 0.080 ounces per ton gold containing 392,000 ounces at a cutoff grade of 0.030 ounces per ton. In September 2008, Telesto updated the estimate of the contained resource gold ounces. The updated Report, which included 19 additional holes not in the June 2008 Report, showed a resource of 7,179,984 tons grading 0.072 ounces per ton gold containing 510,000 ounces of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.030 ounces per ton. As of March 24, 2009, we have drilled a total of 179 holes. We expect an updated resource estimate and scoping / feasibility report to be released in the short term.
Future Exploration Potential
We are conducting an exploration program to test surface mineral targets as well as deep underground bonanza targets by using geological mapping, geochemical/geophysical investigations and drilling.
Gold Canyon and Spring Valley (Placer Claims)
We own a 100% interest in the 25 federal unpatented placer claims located in Lyon County, Nevada known as the Gold Canyon and Spring Valley claims. The 25 unpatented placer claims cover approximately 850 acres and are located about 30 miles southeast of Reno and six miles south of Virginia City, Nevada. We have not completed any exploration activity on the Gold Canyon or Spring Valley properties. The properties are undeveloped and do not contain any open-pit or underground mines. We have not established any proven or probable reserves on the mineral claims. All of our activities associated with these properties are exploratory in nature. The processing plant is stored at our Plum Mining property in American Flat, Nevada. We have no plans to begin test mining operations on these properties in the near-term.

The “Big Mike” Copper Project
We own a 100% interest in the 17 unpatented lode claims and one placer claim covering a total of approximately 310 acres in Pershing County, Nevada that comprise the Big Mike Copper property. The Big Mike Copper property is located approximately 32 miles south of Winnemucca in Pershing County, Nevada. Access to this site is available by way of Grass Valley Road, a county maintained paved and gravel road, for 30 miles and then two miles on a BLM gravel road. The property is situated at an elevation of 5,000 to 5,500 feet. We have not completed any exploration activity or undertaken any geologic, engineering or economic studies on the Big Mike Copper property. The property includes an open pit, mineralized material in a stockpile, and waste dumps. As the site was previously mined, there are also roads and graded areas on the property. Two cased water wells with rights to two cubic feet per second are also present on the property.
At the end of September 2006, the Company entered into a ten year lease with a local company, controlled by a former GoldSpring director, for a 10 year lease of all of its mining claims for its Big Mike copper mine. The Lease calls for a $50,000 initial payment, to cover royalty payments due for the first two years of the lease term. Additionally, the lessee must pay Goldspring $75,000 when a production permit is awarded and $125,000 when commercial mining commences. Additionally, the lessee agrees to a work expenditure of $300,000 for environmental and engineering matters in the first thirty-six months of the lease. During the term of the lease, Goldspring will also receive a production royalty of between 3% and 5% of net returns from copper mining, dependent on the price of copper.
