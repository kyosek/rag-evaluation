RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Our primary business objective is to generate income by investing in real estate loans. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to make real estate loans to owners and developers of real property whose financing needs are not met by traditional real estate lenders. The loan underwriting standards utilized by our manager and Vestin Originations are less strict than traditional real estate lenders. In addition, one of our competitive advantages is our ability to approve loan applications more quickly than traditional lenders. As a result, in certain cases, we make real estate loans that are riskier than real estate loans made by commercial banks. However, in return we seek a higher interest rate and our manager takes steps to mitigate the lending risks such as imposing a lower loan to value ratio. While we may assume more risk than traditional real estate lenders, in return, we seek to generate higher yields from our real estate loans.
- -
Prior to March 5, 2007, our real estate program objective was to invest in income-producing multifamily residential units, assisted living facilities, office buildings, industrial and retail properties and other income-producing real property, such as hotels and resorts, restaurants, parking lots and amusement parks. We disposed of our only investment in real estate in November 2006 and on March 5, 2007, our members voted to amend our operating agreement so that in the future we will only invest in loans secured by mortgages on real estate.
Our operating results are affected primarily by: (i) the amount of capital we have to invest in real estate loans, (ii) the level of real estate lending activity in the markets we service, (iii) our ability to identify and work with suitable borrowers, (iv) the interest rates we are able to charge on our loans and (v) the level of non-performing assets, foreclosures and related loan losses which we may experience. At December 31, 2006, the following loans were non-performing (based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the payment of interest is 90 days past due); Monterrey Associates LP, Forest Development LLC and Babuski LLC. These loans are currently carried on our books at a value of approximately $1.6 million. These loans have been placed on non-accrual of interest status and are the subject of pending foreclosure proceedings. For additional information see “Specific Loan Allowance” in Note D - Investments In Real Estate Loans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this report Form 10-K. Non-performing assets totaled approximately $2.2 million or 6.2% of our total assets as of December 31, 2006 as compared to none as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, non-performing assets consisted of approximately $0.6 million of real estate held for sale and approximately $1.6 million of non-performing loans. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following transaction related to our real estate held for sale:
·
During November 2006, we, VRM I and VRM II acquired 480 residential building lots and two single family dwellings in Rio Vista Village Subdivision in Cathedral City, CA, through foreclosure. Our portion of the defaulted loan was approximately $0.6 million. Our manager has evaluated the carrying value of the property and based on its estimate, no valuation allowance was deemed necessary as of December 31, 2006. The property is currently the subject of a purchase agreement for a total sales price of approximately $29.9 million, of which our portion will be approximately $0.6 million.
The increase in non-performing assets may reflect the continuing weakness in certain sectors of the economy and the risk inherent in our business strategy, which entails more lenient underwriting standards and expedited loan approval procedures. If the economy weakens and our borrowers who develop and sell commercial real estate projects are unable to complete their projects or obtain takeout financing or are otherwise adversely impacted, we may experience an increase in loan defaults, which may reduce the amount of funds we have to pay dividends to our stockholders. Such conditions may also require us to restructure loans. The weighted average term of our outstanding loans, including extensions, as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was 14 months and months, respectively.
Uncertain economic conditions during the next year could have a material impact on the collectibility of our loans. A downturn in the real estate markets where we conduct business might increase defaults on our loans and might require us to record additional reserves with respect to non-performing loans. Recognizing the risk, we seek to maintain an adequate loan-to-value ratio which, as of December 31, 2006, was 65.06% on a weighted average basis, as compared to 60.16% as of December 31, 2005. We generally use appraisals prepared on an “as-if developed” basis in connection with the loan origination. We hope to retain sufficient cushion in the underlying equity position to protect the value of our loans in the event of a default. Nevertheless, no assurances can be given that a marked increase in loan defaults accompanied by a rapid decline in real estate values will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and operating results.
From time to time, we may acquire or sell investments in real estate loans from/to our manager or other related parties pursuant to the terms of our Operating Agreement provided the price does not exceed the par value of the loan. No gain or loss is recorded on these transactions, as it is not our intent to make a profit on the purchase or sale of such investments. The purpose is generally to diversify our portfolio by syndicating loans, thereby providing us with additional capital to make additional loans. For further information regarding related party transitions, refer to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence in Part III of this report Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2006, our loans were in the following states: Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS
The Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared To the Year Ended December 31,
Total Revenues: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased compared to the same period in 2005, by $121,000 or 3.4%, notwithstanding an increase in the total amount of outstanding loans and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our loans from 10.38% to 11.31%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the following factors:
·
Rental income declined by $96,000 due to the sale of an office building which we owned during November 2006. In the future, we will no longer earn rental income because, at a Special Meeting of our members held on March 5, 2007, amendments to our Operating Agreement were approved, limiting the Company’s investment objectives to investment in real estate loans.
·
Interest income from investments in real estate loans declined by $91,000. Our revenue is dependent upon the balance of our investment in real estate loans and the interest earned on these loans. As of December 31, 2006, our investment in real estate loans was approximately $27.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 11.31%. As of December 31, 2005, our investment in real estate loans was approximately $23.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 10.38%. However, during the first three quarters of 2006, our investment in real estate loans decreased by approximately $2.2 million, attributable in part to the reduction in capital, resulting from membership unit redemptions, we had available for investments. Our capital was reduced by redemption of membership units of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.
In addition, our interest income was affected by the performances of our loans. During the year ended December 31, 2006, four loans totaling approximately $2.2 million became non-performing. One of the non-performing loans, with a balance of approximately $0.6 million was foreclosed upon and reclassified to real estate held for sale. For additional information see Note D - Investment Real Estate Loans and Note H - Real Estate Held For Sale of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Report on Form 10-K.
·
We recorded dividend income of $47,000 related to our investment in VRM II for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was purchased in August 2006.
Total Operating Expenses: For each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, total operating expenses were approximately $1.3 million. Expenses were primarily affected by the following factors:
·
We paid management fees to our manager based on 3% of the total rental income and up to 2.5% of the gross offering proceeds for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid our manager $26,000 for management fees relating to rental activity and $129,000 for acquisition and advisory fees pertaining to the gross offering proceeds for a total of $155,000. Since we are no longer selling our units, excepted as permitted in our distribution reinvestment plan, fees related to gross offering proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2006, were $20,000 of the total $45,000 management fees.
·
Expenses related to professional fees decreased by $180,000. This was partially due to a decrease in accounting fees of $162,000 related to the measures undertaken by our manager to contain costs, including an enhancement of its internal accounting capabilities.
These decreases were offset by the increase in interest expenses, which included a defeasance fee of $435,000 related to the note payoff on the building that was sold in November 2006.
- -
Other Income and Expenses: During November 2006, we sold our only investment in real property which consisted of an approximately 42,000 square foot office building located at 8379 West Sunset Road in Las Vegas, Nevada for a gain of approximately $2.6 million. We used the building sales proceeds primarily to invest approximately $8.5 million in real estate loans. There were no similar transactions during the year ended December 31, 2005.
Distributions to Members: The following is a schedule of distributions made to members for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Net Income Available for Distributions is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined in our Operating Agreement as cash flows from operations, less certain reserves, and may exceed net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have presented net income available for distribution because management believes this financial measure is useful and important to members. Although we generally do not plan to make distributions in excess of net income available for distribution, we may do so from time to time. Any such distribution will be treated as a return of capital for income tax purposes. In addition, cash flows from operations, which are the significant component of net income available for distribution, affect the capital available for investment in new loans. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using net income available for distribution only supplementally.
The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net income available for distribution is cash flows from operating activities. The following table reconciles net income available for distribution to cash flows from operating activities and presents the two other major categories of our statement of cash flows:
- -
Stated Unit Value Adjustment: Following a periodic review by our manager as required pursuant to the Operating Agreement, as a result of the gain on sale of our real estate held for investment, effective December 15, 2006 we adjusted the stated unit value from $10.50 per unit to $11.00 per unit to reflect the estimated net unit value of each unit at that date. The periodic review of the estimated net unit value includes an analysis of unrealized gains that our manager reasonably believes exist at the time of the review, but that cannot be added to net asset value under GAAP.
Redemptions: In accordance with the terms of our Operating Agreement and Internal Revenue Code, we may redeem no more than 10% of the aggregate Members’ capital in any calendar year. As of December 31, 2006, the total of redemptions made from inception was approximately $3.2 million. Balances in Members’ capital accounts as of January 1, 2006 were approximately $29.2 million, which limited redemptions to approximately $2.9 million for calendar 2006. Total redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $2.9 million. The remaining requests to redeem, as of December 31, 2006, were approximately $2.9 million in 2007, $2.5 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2009 and $47,000 in subject to unit valuation adjustments. On March 8, 2007, we redeemed 137,766 units totaling approximately $1.5 million.
The Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared To the Year Ended December 31,
Total Revenues: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased approximately $1.3 million or 53.22% from the prior period in 2004 primarily due to the following:
·
Interest income from real estate loans increased by approximately $1.1 million or 84.48% primarily due to the increase in investment in real estate loans from approximately $13.6 million as of December 31, 2004 to approximately $23.0 million as of December 31, 2005, an increase of $9.4 million. This increase was offset by the decrease in the weighted average interest rate on real estate loans from 11.71% at December 31, 2004 to 10.38% at December 31, 2005. Additionally, we incurred a decrease of $527,000 in interest income related to secured borrowings, which relates to the decrease in assets under secured borrowings of approximately $2.1 million from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
·
Revenues derived from income-producing real property increased approximately $0.7 million or 228.08%. Investment in real property consists of a 42,000 square foot office building located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which we acquired in August 2004. As a result, our 2004 results reflected four and a half months of rental income, as compared to a full year of rental income in 2005. The office building is fully leased by Vestin Group.
Total Expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2005, total expenses were approximately $1.3 million compared to approximately $1.0 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of $0.3 million or 30.71%. Expenses were primarily affected by the following:
·
Interest expenses related to investment in real property increased by $221,000, as we did not acquire the real property associated with the debt until August 2004.
·
Expenses related to professional fees incurred increased by $345,000 due to an increase in accounting and legal costs related to the preparation of our quarterly and annual public filings.
·
We pay management fees to our manager based on 3% of the total rental income and up to 2.5% of the gross offering proceeds for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid our manager $26,000 for management fees relating to rental activity and $129,000 for acquisition and advisory fees pertaining to the gross offering proceeds, for a total of $155,000.
·
Depreciation and amortization on our investment in real property increased $141,000 as we did not acquire the property until August 2004.
- -
The increase in expenses was partially offset by the following decreases:
·
Interest expenses related to secured borrowings decreased by $494,000 due to the decrease in the amount of loans financed under secured borrowings throughout the year.
·
There was no additional provision for loan losses for the year ending December 31, 2005, as our general allowance for loan losses was generally sufficient to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. During the year ending December 31, 2004, we recorded a general allowance of $73,000.
Distributions to Members: The following is a schedule of distributions made to members for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Net Income Available for Distributions is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined in our Operating Agreement as cash flows from operations, less certain reserves, and may exceed net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have presented net income available for distribution because management believes this financial measure is useful and important to members. Although we generally do not plan to make distributions in excess of net income available for distribution, we may do so from time to time. Any such distribution will be treated as a return of capital for income tax purposes. In addition, cash flows from operations, which are the significant component of net income available for distribution, affect the capital available for investment in new loans. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using net income available for distribution only supplementally.
The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net income available for distribution is cash flows from operating activities. The following table reconciles net income available for distribution to cash flows from operating activities and presents the two other major categories of our statement of cash flows:
- -
Stated Unit Value Adjustment: Following a periodic review by our manager as required pursuant to the Operating Agreement, as a result of the increase in the estimated fair value of real estate held for investment, effective December 15, 2005 we adjusted the stated unit value from $10.30 per unit to $10.50 per unit to reflect the estimated net unit value of each unit at that date. The periodic review of the estimated net unit value includes an analysis of unrealized gains that our manager reasonably believes exist at the time of the review, but that cannot be added to net asset value under GAAP.
Redemptions: In order to comply with our Operating Agreement and Internal Revenue Code, we may redeem no more than 10% of the aggregate members’ capital in any calendar year. As of December 31, 2005, the total of redemptions made from inception was $341,000. Balances in members’ capital accounts as of January 1, 2005 were approximately $24.8 million, which limited redemptions to approximately $2.5 million for the calendar year 2005. Total redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2005, were $330,000.
CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY
Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to fund investing activities and for general operating purposes. Subject to an approximate 3% reserve, we seek to use most of our available funds to invest in real estate loans. Distributable cash flow generated from such investments is paid out to our members unless they have elected to reinvest their distributions. We do not anticipate the need for hiring any employees, acquiring fixed assets such as office equipment or furniture, or incurring material office expenses during the next twelve months because Vestin Mortgage will manage our affairs.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, cash flows provided by our operating activities were approximately $2.2 million. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of cash used from the purchase of new investments in loans secured by real estate in the amount of approximately $29.4 million and cash proceeds from sales and payments on investments in real estate loans were approximately $24.8 million. Cash proceeds from sale of investment in real property totaled approximately $13.4 million. In addition, we purchased $0.8 million in marketable securities - related party. Our financing activities primarily consisted of cash used for members’ distributions, net of reinvestments, of approximately $1.7 million, members’ redemptions of approximately $2.9 million and full payment of approximately $4.8 million on a note payable related to the building we sold.
Since we distribute most or all of our operating income, our sources of liquidity include: repayments of outstanding loans, distribution reinvestments by our members and arrangements with third parties to participate in our loans. Effective November 7, 2005, we discontinued the offering of our Units, except for Units sold through our Distribution Reinvestment Plan.
We rely primarily upon repayment of outstanding loans to provide capital for investment in new loans. Any significant level of defaults on outstanding loans could reduce the funds we have available for investment in new loans. Resulting foreclosure proceedings may not generate full repayment of our loans and may result in significant delays in the return of invested funds. This would diminish our capital resources and would impair our ability to invest in new loans. Non-performing assets totaled approximately $2.2 million or 6.2% of our total assets as of December 31, 2006 as compared to none as of December 31, 2005. Our non-performing assets, at December 31, 2006, consisted of approximately $0.6 million of real estate held for sale and approximately $1.6 million of non-performing loans. It is possible that no earnings will be recognized from these assets until they are disposed of, or that no earnings will be recognized at all, and the time it will take to dispose of these assets cannot be predicted. Our manager believes that these non-performing assets are a result of factors unique to specific borrowers and properties. Because of the estimated value of the underlying properties, we do not currently believe that any losses beyond those already recognized will be incurred from these assets upon final disposition. However, it is possible that we will not be able to realize the full estimated carrying values upon disposition.
- -
In addition, any significant level of redemptions by our members would reduce the capital we have available for investment. In order to comply with our Operating Agreement and Internal Revenue Code, we may redeem no more than 10% of the aggregate Members’ capital in any calendar year. As of December 31, 2006, the total of redemptions made from inception was approximately $3.2 million. Balances in Members’ capital accounts as of January 1, 2006 were approximately $29.2 million, which limited redemptions to approximately $2.9 million for calendar 2006. Total redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $2.9 million. The remaining requests to redeem, as of December 31, 2006, were approximately $2.9 million in 2007, $2.5 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2009 and $47,000 in subject to unit valuation adjustments. On March 8, 2007, we redeemed 137,766 units totaling approximately $1.5 million.
Approximately 44% of our members, holding approximately 29% of our outstanding units, currently reinvest their distributions. The level of reinvested distributions is likely to be affected by our operating performance. If our performance does not meet the expectations of our members, the level of reinvestment may decline.
Loans in which unaffiliated investors have participated through inter-creditor agreements (“Inter-creditor Agreements”) are accounted for as secured borrowings in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) 140 - Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (“FAS 140”). The Inter-creditor Agreements provide us additional funding sources for real estate loans whereby an unaffiliated investor (the “Investor”) may participate on a non-pari passu basis in certain real estate loans with us and/or VRM I and/or VRM II (collectively, the “Lead Lenders”). In the event of borrower non- performance, the Inter-creditor Agreements generally provide that the Lead Lenders must repay the Investor’s loan amount either by (i) continuing to remit to the Investor the interest due on the participated loan amount; (ii) substituting an alternative loan acceptable to the Investor; or (iii) repurchasing the participation from the Investor for the outstanding balance plus accrued interest.
During October 2006, we, our manager, Vestin Origination, Inc., VRM I and VRM II entered into an intercreditor agreement with an unrelated third party related to the funding of a construction real estate loan. (See exhibit 10.10 Intercreditor Agreement under the Exhibit Index included in Part IV, Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Report Form 10-K). The secured borrowing will be recognized pro rata between us, VRM I and VRM II for the amount each entity has funded for the loan. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $24.3 million has been funded on this loan, of which our portion was approximately $1.4 million. As of December 31, 2006, this secured borrowing totaled approximately $18.5 million, of which our portion was approximately $4.4 million. In the event VRM I and VRM II were unable to pay their pro rata share of the secured borrowing, we would be liable for the full outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2005, we had $527,000 in funds being used under Inter-creditor Agreements.
At December 31, 2006 we had restricted cash totaling $985,000, which relates to a cash deposit held as collateral by a banking institution to support rent payments on the property we sold during November 2006. The requirement for the deposit expires in November 2007, which may be extended for an additional year.
We maintain working capital reserves of approximately 3% of aggregate members’ capital accounts in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. This reserve is available to pay expenses in excess of revenues, satisfy obligations of underlying secured properties, expend money to satisfy our unforeseen obligations and for other permitted uses of the working capital. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $0.8 million in cash, $0.8 million invested in marketable securities - related party and approximately $34.9 million in total assets.
We may seek to expand our capital resources through borrowings from institutional lenders or through securitization of our loan portfolio or similar arrangements. We currently do not have in place any commitments to borrow any funds or securitize any of our assets. No assurance can be given that, if we should seek to borrow funds or to securitize our assets we would be able to do so on commercially attractive terms. Our ability to expand our capital resources in this manner is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the state of the economy, the state of the capital markets and the perceived quality of our loan portfolio.

Investments in Real Estate Loans Secured by Real Estate Portfolio
We offer five real estate loan products consisting of commercial, construction, acquisition and development, land, and residential loans. The effective interest rates on all product categories range from 9% to 13%. Revenue by product will fluctuate based upon relative balances during the period. We had investments in 27 real estate loans as of December 31, 2006, with a balance of approximately $27.1 million as compared to investments in 20 real estate loans as of December 31, 2005, with a balance of approximately $23.0 million.
At December 31, 2006, the following loans were non-performing (based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the payment of interest is 90 days past due); Monterrey Associates LP, Forest Development LLC and Babuski LLC. These loans are currently carried on our books at a value of approximately $1.6 million. These loans have been placed on non-accrual of interest status and are the subject of pending foreclosure proceedings.
Our manager periodically reviews and makes a determination as to whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses or included as income when the asset is disposed. As of December 31, 2006, we have provided a general reserve of $73,000. Our manager evaluated the loans and concluded that the remaining underlying collateral was sufficient to protect us against further losses of principal or interest. Our manager will continue to evaluate these loans in order to determine if any other allowance for loan losses should be recorded. For additional information on our investments in real estate loans, refer to Note D - Investments In Real Estate Loans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Investment in Real Property
As of December 31, 2006, we had no investments in real property. During November 2006, we sold our only investment in real property which consisted of an approximately 42,000 square foot office building located at 8379 West Sunset Road in Las Vegas, Nevada for a gain of approximately $2.6 million. Since the sale of the building, we no longer recognize rental income related to the building. For additional information on our investments in real property, refer to Note E - Investments In Real Property, Note F - Leasing Activity and Note Q - Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item Financial Statements of this Interim Report Form 10-Q.
Asset Quality and Loan Reserves
Losses may occur from investing in real estate loans. The amounts of losses will vary as the loan portfolio is affected by changing economic conditions and the financial condition of borrowers.
The conclusion that a real estate loan is uncollectible or that collectibility is doubtful is a matter of judgment. On a quarterly basis, the manager evaluates our real estate loan portfolio for impairment. The fact that a loan is temporarily past due does not necessarily mean that the loan is impaired. Rather, all relevant circumstances are considered by our manager to determine impairment and the need for specific reserves. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters:
·
Prevailing economic conditions;
·
Historical experience;
- -
·
The nature and volume of the loan portfolio;
·
The borrowers’ financial condition and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay;
·
Evaluation of industry trends; and
·
Estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral in relation to the real estate loan amount.
Based upon this evaluation, a determination is made as to whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts would be credited to the provision for loan losses or included in income. For additional information on asset quality and loan reserve, refer to Investments In Real Estate Loans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Segment Information
Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Reportable segments consist of one or more operating segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, type of customer, distribution system and regulatory environment.
The information provided for Segment Reporting is based on internal reports utilized by management. The presentation and allocation of overhead and the net contribution for the operating segments may not reflect the actual economic costs, contribution or results of operations of the segments as stand-alone businesses. If a different basis of allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends in segments would, in management’s view, likely not be impacted. For additional information on our investments in real property, refer to Note Q - Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report Form 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Revenue Recognition
Interest income on loans is accrued by the effective interest method. We do not recognize interest income from loans once they are determined to be impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the payment of interest is 90 days past due.
The following table presents a sensitivity analysis to show the impact on our financial condition at December 31, 2006 from fluctuations in weighted average interest rate charged on loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact that the weighted average interest rate fluctuations would have on our financial results. It is not intended to imply our expectation of future revenues or to estimate earnings. We believe that the assumptions used above are appropriate to illustrate the possible material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses
We maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in real estate loans for estimated credit impairment in our investment in real estate loans portfolio. The manager’s estimate of losses is based on a number of factors including the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, prevailing economic conditions and the underlying collateral securing the loan. Additions to the allowance are provided through a charge to earnings and are based on an assessment of certain factors, which may indicate estimated losses on the loans. Actual losses on loans are recorded as a charge-off or a reduction to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added back to the allowance or included as income.
The following table presents a sensitivity analysis to show the impact on our financial condition at December 31, 2006 from increases and decreases to our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the loan portfolio:
Estimating allowances for loan losses requires significant judgment about the underlying collateral, including liquidation value, condition of the collateral, competency and cooperation of the related borrower and specific legal issues that affect loan collections or taking possession of the property. As a non-conventional lender willing to invest in loans to borrowers who may not meet the credit standards of conventional lenders, the default rate on our loans could be higher than those generally experienced in the mortgage lending industry. We, our manager and Vestin Originations generally approves loans more quickly than other real estate lenders and, due to our expedited underwriting process, there is a risk that the credit inquiry we perform will not reveal all material facts pertaining to a borrower and the security.
- -
We may discover additional facts and circumstances as we continue our efforts in the collection and foreclosure processes. This additional information often causes management to reassess its estimates. Circumstances that may cause significant changes in our estimated allowance include, but not limited to:
·
Declines in real estate market conditions that can cause a decrease in expected market value;
·
Discovery of undisclosed liens for community improvement bonds, easements and delinquent property taxes;
·
Lack of progress on real estate developments after we advance funds. We customarily utilize disbursement agents to monitor the progress of real estate developments and approve loan advances. After further inspection of the related property, progress on construction occasionally does not substantiate an increase in value to support the related loan advances;
·
Unanticipated legal or business issues that may arise subsequent to loan origination or upon the sale of foreclosed upon property; and
·
Appraisals, which are only opinions of value at the time of the appraisal, may not accurately reflect the value of the property.
Real Estate Held For Sale
Real estate held for sale includes real estate acquired through foreclosure and will be carried at the lower of the recorded amount, inclusive of any senior indebtedness, or the property's estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, with fair value based on appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions. While pursuing foreclosure actions, the Company seeks to identify potential purchasers of such property. It is not the Company's intent to invest in or own real estate as a long-term investment. In accordance with FAS 144 - Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company seeks to sell properties acquired through foreclosure as quickly as circumstances permit. The carrying values of real estate held for sale are assessed on a regular basis from updated appraisals, comparable sales values or purchase offers.
Management classifies real estate held for sale when the following criteria are met:
·
Management commits to a plan to sell the properties;
·
The property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary;
·
An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete a sale have been initiated;
·
The sale of the property is probable;
·
The property is being actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price; and
·
Withdrawal or significant modification of the sale is not likely.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in interest rates. We do not deal in any foreign currencies and do not own any options, futures or other derivative instruments. We do not have a significant amount of debt.
- -
Most of our assets consisted of investments in real estate loans, which from time to time include those that are financed under Inter-creditor Agreements. At December 31, 2006, our aggregate investment in real estate loans was approximately $27.1 million, net of allowance, with a weighted average effective interest rate of 11.31%. We had one loan financed under an Inter-creditor Agreement at December 31, 2006, which was classified as assets under secured borrowing totaling approximately $4.4 million. Most of the real estate loans had an initial term of 12 months. The weighted average term of outstanding loans, including extensions, at December 31, 2006 was 14 months. All but one of the outstanding real estate loans at December 31, 2006 were fixed rate loans. All of the real estate loans are held for investment purposes; none are held for sale. We intend to hold such real estate loans to maturity. None of the real estate loans had prepayment penalties and nine had an exit fee.
Market fluctuations in interest rates generally do not affect the carrying value of our investment in real estate loans. However, significant and sustained changes in interest rates could affect our operating results. If interest rates decline significantly, some of the borrowers could prepay their loans with the proceeds of a refinancing at lower interest rates. This would reduce our earnings and funds available for distribution to members. On the other hand, a significant increase in interest rates could result in a slowdown in real estate development activity that would reduce the demand for commercial real estate loans. As a result, we might encounter greater difficulty in identifying appropriate borrowers. We are not in a position to quantify the potential impact on our operating results from a material change in interest rates.
The following table contains information about the investment in real estate loans held in our portfolio as of December 31, 2006. The presentation aggregates the investment in real estate loans by their maturity dates for maturities occurring in each of the years 2007 through 2010 and thereafter and separately aggregates the information for all maturities arising after 2010. The carrying values of these assets approximate their fair value as of December 31, 2006.
At December 31, 2006, we also had approximately $1.6 million invested in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities - related party (VRM II). Approximately 3% of our aggregate members capital accounts will be held in such accounts as a cash reserve; additional deposits in such accounts will be made as funds are received from investors and repayment of loans pending the deployment of such funds in new real estate loans. We believe that these financial assets do not give rise to significant interest rate risk due to their short-term nature.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our manager’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In connection with the preparation of this Report on Form 10-K, our manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our manager’s CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2006, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our manager’s CEO and CFO believe that these controls and procedures are adequate to ensure we are able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to disclose in the reports it files with the SEC within the required time periods.
The certifications of the our managers Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of our Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of our Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management is conducting an assessment, including testing, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management is using the criteria in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting requires continued testing in order to conclude on the effectiveness of the controls
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management has not identified any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the Quarter ended December 31, 2006, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting, except as discussed below.
During January 2007, to consolidate the duplicate functions held by the manager and the audit committee, we eliminated the role of the audit committee.
- -
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within our company have been or will be detected. Even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our controls and procedures will prevent all errors.
