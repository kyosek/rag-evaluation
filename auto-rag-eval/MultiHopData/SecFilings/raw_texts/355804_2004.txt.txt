Rental Rates and Occupancy
The following table sets forth the average annual rental rates and occupancy for 2004 and 2003 for each property.
The decrease in occupancy at Citadel Apartments is primarily due to military deployments in the local area. The increases in occupancy at Citadel Village and Village East Apartments is due to a more aggressive marketing campaign and the use of competitive pricing strategies in the local market coupled with the return of military personnel from overseas deployment. The decrease in occupancy at Foothill Place Apartments is due to a more stringent tenant acceptance policy in order to create a more stable customer base and due to the addition of new student housing in the local area, which has created greater competition for tenants. The decreases in occupancy at Knollwood and Post Ridge Apartments are due to a more stringent tenant acceptance policy in order to create a more stable customer base. In addition, some units were uninhabitable due to fire damage at Knollwood Apartments and roofing issues at Post Ridge Apartments. The increase in occupancy at Rivers Edge Apartments is due to a more aggressive marketing campaign and the use of competitive pricing strategies in the local market.
During 2003, the General Partner determined that Belmont Place Apartments suffered from severe structural defects in the buildings' foundation and as such, demolished the property. The General Partner has designed and approved a redevelopment plan for the property. Site work on the redevelopment began during the fourth quarter of 2003.
The Partnership has entered into a construction contract with Casden Builders, Inc. (a related party) to develop the new Belmont Place Apartments at an estimated cost of approximately $26.9 million. The construction contract provides for the payment of the cost of the work plus a fee without a maximum guaranteed price. Construction is expected to be completed in 2005 at a total project cost of approximately $31.6 million. The Partnership has funded construction expenditures from operating cash flow, proceeds from a cross collateralized loan, Partnership reserves, loans from an affiliate of the General Partner and sales proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately $19,762,000 of construction costs were incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Partnership capitalized interest costs of approximately $299,000, $390,000, and $107,000, tax and insurance expenses of approximately $136,000, $226,000, and $31,000, and other construction period operating expenses of approximately $105,000, $351,000, and $65,000, respectively. The Partnership anticipates additional construction costs of approximately $11.8 million during 2005 which will be funded by, among other things, additional loans from the General Partner.
As part of the redevelopment, during the year ended December 31, 2004, an affiliate of the General Partner advanced the Partnership approximately $5,600,000 to repay the mortgage and associated accrued interest encumbering Belmont Place Apartments. The loan was scheduled to mature in December 2005.

As noted under "Item 1. Description of Business", the real estate industry is highly competitive. All of the properties are subject to competition from other residential apartment complexes in the area. The General Partner believes that all of the properties are adequately insured. Each property is an apartment complex which leases units for lease terms of one year or less. No residential tenant leases 10% or more of the available rental space. All of the properties are in good physical condition, with the exception of Belmont Place Apartments, as described above, subject to normal depreciation and deterioration as is typical for assets of this type and age.
