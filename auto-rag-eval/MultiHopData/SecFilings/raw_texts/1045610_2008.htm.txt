ITEM 2.
Properties
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2008, we owned and managed 1,116 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 131.5 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, we had 696 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 72.8 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 49 global markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our industrial properties were 95.1% leased to 2,602 customers, the largest of which accounted
for no more than 4.1% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information related to our operations.
Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings.
The following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on square footage, of our total owned and managed operating portfolio:
Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options.
Overview of Our Global Market Presence. Our industrial properties are located in the following markets:
Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These infill locations are typically near major airports or seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.
Portfolio Overview
The following includes our owned and managed operating portfolio and development properties, investments in operating properties through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, and recently completed developments that have not yet been placed in operations but are being held for sale or contribution:
(1)
Annualized base rent (“ABR”) is calculated as monthly base rent (cash basis) per the terms of the lease, as of December 31, 2008, multiplied by 12.
(2)
See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a reconciliation to net income and a discussion of why management believes same store cash basis NOI is a useful supplemental measure for our management and investors, ways to use this measure when assessing our financial performance, and the limitations of the measure as a measurement tool.
(3)
Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenant’s term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current
lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation.
(4)
Includes domestic on-tarmac air cargo facilities at 14 airports.
(5)
Annualized base rent for leases denominated in foreign currencies is translated using the currency exchange rate at December 31, 2008.
(6)

Properties Held Through Co-investment Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships
The following table summarizes our eight consolidated and unconsolidated significant co-investment ventures as of December 31, 2008:
Consolidated Joint Ventures
As of December 31, 2008, we held interests in co-investment ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties, which we consolidate in our financial statements. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46) or EITF Issue No. 04-5 (EITF 04-5), Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights and SOP 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04-5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. We are the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) in a number of our consolidated joint venture investments. In all such cases, the limited partners in such investments (or equivalent of limited partners in such investments which are not structured as partnerships) do not have rights described in EITF 04-5, which would preclude consolidation. We consolidate certain other joint ventures where we are not the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) because we have control over those entities through majority ownership, retention of the majority of economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights and/or substantive participating rights.
Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, we and the other party to the co-investment venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests by us or the other party to the co-investment venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the co-investment venture to sell our or their interest in the co-investment venture to the co-investment venture or to the other co-investment venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures include buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 9 and 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details.
The table that follows summarizes our consolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
For development properties, represents the estimated square feet upon completion for committed phases of development projects.
(2)
Represents the book value of the property (before accumulated depreciation) owned by the joint venture and excludes net other assets as of December 31, 2008. Development book values include uncommitted land.
(3)
AMB-SGP, L.P. is a co-investment partnership formed in 2001 with Industrial JV Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
As of December 31, 2008, we held interests in five significant equity investment co-investment ventures that are not consolidated in our financial statements. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46) or EITF Issue No. 04-5 (EITF 04-5), Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights and SOP 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04-5 where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In such unconsolidated joint ventures, either we are not the general partner (or general partner equivalent) and do not hold sufficient capital or any rights that would require consolidation or, alternatively, we are the general partner (or the general partner equivalent) and the other partners (or equivalent) hold substantive participating rights that override the presumption of control.
The table that follows summarizes our unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
For development properties, represents the estimated square feet upon completion for committed phases of development projects.
(2)
Represents the book value of the property (before accumulated depreciation) owned by the joint venture and excludes net other assets as of December 31, 2008. Development book values include uncommitted land.
(3)
On June 13, 2008, we acquired an additional approximate 19% interest in G. Accion, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican real estate company that holds equity method investments, and as a result of our increased ownership, we began consolidating our interest in G. Accion, effective as of that date. On July 18, 2008, we acquired the remaining equity interest (approximately 42%) in G. Accion. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had a 100% consolidated interest and 39% unconsolidated equity interest, respectively, in G. Accion. As our wholly-owned subsidiary, G. Accion has been renamed AMB Property Mexico, S.A. de C.V. and it continues to provide management and development services for industrial, retail and residential properties in Mexico. Through our investment in AMB Property Mexico, we hold equity interests in various other unconsolidated ventures totaling approximately $24.6 million as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, we had equity interests in G. Accion totaling approximately $32.7 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed to this co-investment venture approximately 82 acres of land with a contribution value of approximately $30.3 million.
Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional investors, on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of our accounting for our investment because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006. On July 1, 2008, the partners of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) contributed their interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in exchange for interests in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture.

As a result, the investment was consolidated as of June 30, 2007.
In August 2008, a subsidiary of ours sold its approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund, a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at Canada’s international airports, as part of a tender offer for interests in the income trust.
