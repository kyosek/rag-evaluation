Item 2. Properties
The Company's property portfolio as of December 31, 2003 (including partial ownership interests) consists of ownership interests in 121 multifamily properties (comprising 26,012 apartment units), of which 14,943 units are located in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), 4,605 units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), 5,886 of which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,515 units in the Seattle metropolitan area and 1,371 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area), and 578 are located in other areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276 units in Hemet, California). In addition, the Company owns other real estate assets consisting of five recreational vehicle parks (comprising 1,717 spaces), four office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540 square feet) and two manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites). One office building, which is located in Northern California (Palo Alto), has approximately 17,400 square feet and houses the Company's headquarters. Another office building, located in Southern California (Woodland Hills), has approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the Company currently occupies approximately 8,600 square feet. The Woodland Hills office building has nine third party tenants occupying approximately 27,300 feet. The Company along with its affiliated entities and joint ventures also have entered into commitments for the development of 1,056 units in five multifamily communities; two of which are in Northern California and three in Southern California. See "Development" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of our properties under development.
The Company's multifamily properties accounted for 95% of the Company's property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Occupancy Rates
The 121 multifamily residential properties had an average occupancy, based on "financial occupancy," during the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately 96%. With respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy, which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy.
As of December 31, 2003, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the Company and the Southern California office building was 92% occupied, based on physical occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With respect to recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, none of the Company's Properties had book values equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross revenues equal to 10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.
Multifamily Residential Properties
The Company's multifamily Properties are generally suburban garden apartments and townhomes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land. The multifamily properties have on average 215 units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom units. A wide variety of amenities are available at each apartment community, including covered parking, fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with complete fitness facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts.
The Company selects, trains and supervises a full team of on-site service and maintenance personnel. The Company believes that its customer service approach enhances its ability to retain tenants and that its multifamily Properties were built well and have been maintained well since acquisition.
Office Buildings
The Company's corporate headquarters is located in a two-story office building with approximately 17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive, Palo Alto, California. The Company acquired this property in 1997. The Company also owns an office building in Southern California (Woodland Hills), comprised of approximately 38,940 square feet building, of which the Company currently occupies approximately 8,600 square feet. The building has nine third party tenants occupying approximately 28,700 feet. The largest single tenant occupies approximately 10,900 square feet. The Company acquired this property in 2001. The Company also has two small office buildings comprising approximately 7,200 square feet that are located in San Diego, California.
Recreational Vehicle Parks
The Company owns five recreational vehicle parks, acquired in the Company's December 2002 acquisition of the Sachs Corporation, (comprising of 1,717 spaces) located in El Cajon, California; Hemet, California; and Las Vegas Nevada.
Manufactured Housing Communities
The Company owns manufactured housing communities, acquired in the Company's December 2002 acquisition of the Sachs Corporation, (containing 607 sites) located in Vista, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into lease and purchase option agreements with unrelated third parties related to its five recreational vehicle parks that are comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two manufactured housing communities that contain 607 sites. Based on the agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets in approximately four years for approximately $41.7 million - a 5% premium to the gross book value of the assets. Under the lease agreements Essex is to receive a fixed monthly lease payment in addition to a non-refundable upfront payment that will be amortized over approximately five years (the life of the lease).
