Item 2. Properties.
Turkey
General. As of April 1, 2011, we held interests in 56 onshore exploration licenses and three onshore production leases covering a total of approximately 6.4 million gross acres (approximately 6.0 million net acres) in Turkey. We acquired our interests in Turkey through the acquisitions of Incremental, Talon, Amity and Petrogas, as well as through farm-in agreements with existing third-party license holders and through applications submitted to the GDPA.
The following is a map showing our interests in Turkey:
Thrace Basin. The following is a map showing our interests in the Thrace Basin in northwestern Turkey:
Edirne (Licenses 3839 and 4037). We own a 55% working interest in License 3839 and a 100% working interest in License 4037, which cover an aggregate of approximately 239,000 acres (967 square kilometers). In April 2010, we commenced natural gas sales from the Edirne gas field. AKSA purchases all of our natural gas production from the Edirne field at a price equal to a 15% discount to the Industrial Interruptible Tariff benchmark set by BOTAŞ. There are currently 11 producing wells on the Edirne license, and we plan to drill between 15 and 20 wells on the Edirne exploration licenses in 2011. We are the operator of Licenses 3839 and 4037, which expire in October 2011 and March 2011, respectively. We are applying for a three year extension on License 3839 and a two year extension on License 4037.
Alpullu (Production Lease 3599-4794 and License 4861). We own a 100% working interest in Production Lease 3599-4794 and License 4861, which cover 3,158 acres (13 square kilometers) and approximately 117,000 acres (474 square kilometers), respectively. Upon the acquisition of Amity in August 2010, we commenced limited natural gas sales from the Alpullu production lease. Zorlu purchases substantially all of our natural gas production from the Alpullu production lease at a price equal to a 15% discount to the Industrial Interruptible Tariff benchmark set by BOTAŞ. We currently have six producing wells on the Alpullu production lease, and we plan to drill between five and eight wells in 2011 to further develop the Alpullu production lease and test structures on the Alpullu exploration license. We are the operator of Production Lease 3599-4794 and License 4861, which expire in September 2028 and December 2014, respectively.
Gocerler (Production Lease 4200 and License 4288). We own a 50% working interest in Production Lease 4200 and License 4288, which cover 3,363 acres (14 square kilometers) and approximately 119,000 acres (483 square kilometers), respectively. Upon the acquisition of Amity in August 2010, we commenced limited natural gas sales from the Gocerler production lease. Zorlu purchases all of our natural gas production from the Gocerler production lease at a price equal to a 15% discount to the Industrial Interruptible Tariff benchmark set by BOTAŞ. We currently have three producing wells on the Gocerler production lease. We plan to drill one exploratory well on License 4288 in 2011. TPAO is the operator of Production Lease 4200 and License 4288, which expire in March 2024 and August 2011, respectively. We have applied for a two year extension on License 4288.
Adatepe (License 3648). We own a 50% working interest in License 3648, which covers approximately 121,000 acres (488 square kilometers). Upon the acquisition of Amity in August 2010, we commenced limited natural gas sales from the Adatepe license. Zorlu purchases all of our natural gas production from the Adatepe license at a price equal to a 15% discount to the Industrial Interruptible Tariff benchmark set by BOTAŞ. We currently have seven producing wells on the Adatepe license. We plan to drill one development well on License 3648 in 2011. We are the operator of License 3648, which expires in July 2011. We have applied for a production lease over the Adatepe field. If the production lease is granted, we plan to apply for an exploration license over the remaining acreage.
Malkara (Licenses 4094 and 4532). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4094 and 4532, which cover an aggregate of approximately 242,000 acres (979 square kilometers). We are the operator of Licenses 4094 and 4532, which expire in September 2011 and January 2013, respectively. We have applied for a two year extension on License 4094.
Banarli (License 3864). We own a 50% working interest in License 3864, which covers approximately 96,000 acres (387 square kilometers). We plan to drill two exploratory wells on License 3864 in 2011. We are the operator of License 3864, which expires in April 2012.
Cayirdere and Velimse (Licenses 3791 and 3792). We own a 50% working interest in Licenses 3791 and 3792, which cover an aggregate of approximately 125,000 acres (504 square kilometers). We plan to drill one exploratory well on License 3792 in 2011. TPAO is the operator of Licenses 3791 and 3792, which expire in January 2013.
Southeastern Turkey. The following is a map showing our interests in southeastern Turkey:
Selmo (Production Lease 829). We own a 100% working interest in Production Lease 829, which covers 8,886 acres (36 square kilometers) and includes the Selmo oil field. There are currently 39 producing wells on the Selmo production lease. For 2010, our net production of crude oil in the Selmo field, after royalties, was approximately 631,000 Bbls of crude oil, at an average rate of approximately 1,700 Bbls per day. We sell all of our production from the Selmo oil field to TPAO and TUPRAS. We plan to drill and complete at least 24 wells at Selmo in 2011. We are the operator of Production Lease 829, which expires in June 2015.
Arpatepe (License 3118). We own a 50% working interest in License 3118, which covers approximately 96,000 acres (389 square kilometers) near the city of Diyarbakir. The Arpatepe-1 and Arpatepe-2 wells on License 3118 represent Turkey’s first and second economic discoveries of crude oil from deeper, onshore Paleozoic sandstone formations. For 2010, our net production of crude oil in the Arpatepe field, after royalties, was approximately 58,700 Bbls of crude oil, at an average rate of approximately 160 Bbls per day. We sell all of our production from the Arpatepe oil field to Aladdin. We currently have three producing wells in the Arpatepe field, and we plan to drill up to five additional wells there in 2011. Aladdin is the operator of License 3118, which expires in November 2011. Aladdin has applied for a production lease over the Arpatepe oil field. If the production lease is granted, we expect that Aladdin will apply for an exploration license over the remaining acreage.
Bakuk (Licenses 4069 and 4642). In April and May 2010, with our partner and operator, Tiway, we drilled the Bakuk-101 well to earn a 50% working interest in Licenses 4069 and 4642, which cover an aggregate of approximately 219,000 acres (777 square kilometers) on the Turkish border with Syria. The Bakuk-101 well was successful, with potential production of up to 10.0 Mmcf of natural gas per day. In November 2010, we re-entered the Bakuk-2 well, which failed to establish an oil leg in the reservoir. We have completed construction of a 23 kilometer, 6-inch pipeline from the Bakuk-101 well to an existing pipeline to the south and expect to begin limited natural gas sales in the second quarter of 2011. We are now evaluating options for further appraisal of the reservoir. We plan to drill one well on License 4069 in 2011. We plan to acquire 100 square kilometers of 3D seismic data on License 4642 in 2011. Tiway is the operator of License 4069, which expires in September 2011. We are applying for a two year extension of License 4069. We are the operator of License 4642, which expires in October 2014.
Germav (License 4175). We own a 100% working interest in License 4175, which covers approximately 118,000 acres (476 square kilometers) near the Turkish border with Iraq. The target is a deep sub-thrust play similar to the major Iraqi and Iranian Zagros fields to the south. In 2010, we drilled the Kalatepe-1 well, which is currently undergoing testing and completion. We are the operator of License 4175, which expires in June 2012.
Molla (License 4174). We own a 100% working interest in License 4174, which covers approximately 17,700 acres (71 square kilometers) near the Turkish border with Iraq. Our primary target is an underexplored Paleozoic play at a depth of approximately 9,800 feet. In 2010, we re-entered the Goksu-1 well to test the Hazro and Bedinan sandstone intervals and the Dadas shale intervals, but the re-entry did not discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the Bedinan or Dadas intervals. We plan to test the Hazro sandstone interval later in 2011. We are the operator of License 4174, which expires in June 2012.
Midyat (Licenses 3969, 3970, 3971 and 3972). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 3969, 3970, 3971 and 3972, which cover an aggregate of approximately 460,000 acres (1,863 square kilometers) near the Turkish border with Iraq. We plan to drill one exploratory well on the Midyat licenses in 2011. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in November 2012.
Central Basins. Our exploration licenses in central Turkey cover largely unexplored tertiary basins. We are currently seeking partners in each of these exploration licenses. Through farm-outs, we expect to reduce our exploration risk and accelerate the exploration and development activities on the farmed-out properties. We have begun consolidating and analyzing well data and seismic data for our central basins exploration acreage in Turkey. We intend to remain as operator in the properties that we farm-out. The following is a map showing our interests central Turkey:
Malatya (Licenses 4572, 4573, 4574, 4575, 4576, 4577, 4659 and 4660). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4572, 4573, 4574, 4575, 4576, 4577, 4659 and 4660, which cover an aggregate of approximately 962,000 acres (3,892 square kilometers) in the Malatya area of south-central Turkey. We paid a third party who will be a 10% working interest owner in the Malatya licenses cash consideration and agreed that the party would back-in for its 10% working interest after payout of the first well to be drilled on the Malatya licenses. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We plan to drill one exploratory well on the Malatya licenses in 2011. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in April 2013.
Haymana (Licenses 4310 and 4311), We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 2% overriding royalty interest, in Licenses 4310 and 4311, which cover an aggregate of approximately 243,000 acres (985 square kilometers) in the Tuz Golu Basin south of Ankara in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We plan to relinquish the Haymana licenses in 2011. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in May 2012.
Tuz Golu (Licenses 4314, 4315, 4316, 4317, 4342 and 4344). We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 2% overriding royalty interest, in Licenses 4314, 4315, 4316, 4317, 4342 and 4344, which cover an aggregate of approximately 627,000 acres (2,536 square kilometers) in the Tuz Golu Basin south of Ankara in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We plan to drill one exploratory well on the Tuz Golu licenses in 2011. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in May 2012.
Tuz Golu South (Licenses 4717, 4718, 4719, 4720, 4721 and 4722). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4717, 4718, 4719, 4720, 4721 and 4722, which cover an aggregate of approximately 733,000 acres (2,967 square kilometers) in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in December 2014.
Sivas Basin (Licenses 4729, 4730, 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, 4735, 4736, 4737, 4738, 4739, 4740 and 4741). We own a 100% working interest in Licenses 4729, 4730, 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, 4735, 4736, 4737, 4738, 4739, 4740 and 4741, which cover an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million acres (6,475 square kilometers) in central Turkey. These licenses are in a large, relatively unexplored tertiary basin. We are the operator of the licenses, which expire in December 2014.
Gurun (License 4325). We own a 90% working interest in License 4325, which covers approximately 122,000 acres (495 square kilometers) in central Turkey. In April 2009, we farmed-in to License 4325 for cash consideration and the obligation to carry a 10% interest in the first well drilled to earn a 90% interest in the license. We plan to drill one exploratory well on License 4325 in 2011. We are the operator of License 4325, which expires in February 2012.
Yuksekkoy (License 4350). We own a 100% working interest in License 4350, which covers approximately 121,000 acres (488 square kilometers) on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. We are the operator of License 4350, which expires in March 2012.
Gaziantep (Licenses 4607, 4638, 4648, 4649 and 4656). In March 2010, we entered into a farm-in agreement with TBNG to acquire a 50% working interest in Licenses 4607, 4638, 4648, 4649 and 4656, which cover an aggregate of approximately 610,000 acres (6,447 square kilometers) near the Turkish border with Syria. To earn the interest, we will pay 62.5% of total drilling and seismic costs on the licenses until 12.5% of total drilling and seismic costs paid equals $750,000. Thereafter, we will pay 50% of drilling and seismic costs incurred. We expect to terminate this farm-in agreement upon our acquisition of TBNG, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2011. TBNG is the operator of these licenses, which expire in October 2013, except License 4607, which expires in August 2013.
We lease an equipment yard in Diyarbakir and own equipment yards at Selmo and Edirne. We currently own six drilling rigs and four workover and completion rigs that are located in Turkey. We also manage one drilling rig in Turkey for Viking Drilling pursuant to a management services agreement.
We had total net proved reserves of 12,936 Mbbl of oil and 22,425 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 5,341 Mbbl of oil and 38,312 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 12,803 Mbbl of oil and 174,126 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey as of December 31, 2010.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. Royalties are at 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. The licenses have a four-year term but after the third year, a payment in the form of a bond must be made to extend the license if no new well has been drilled prior to that date. The GDPA, the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey, awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA.
A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for petroleum. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. No single company may own more than eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the hectares under the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder applies to convert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares, to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years. Annual rentals are due based on the hectares comprising the lease.
Morocco
General. As of April 1, 2011, we owned interests in eight onshore exploration permits in northern Morocco. The following is a map showing our interests in Morocco:
Tselfat. We own a 100% working interest in the Tselfat exploration permit (subject to a 25% participation interest by ONHYM once production is achieved), which covers approximately 222,000 acres (900 square kilometers) in northern Morocco. As part of our recent extension of the license period, in January 2011 we relinquished 45% of our Tselfat exploration permit acreage. The Tselfat exploration permit covers three existing fields, Haricha, Brou Draa and Tselfat, that produced from the early 1920s to 1970s, with limited production continuing into the 1990s. The Tselfat permit provides several opportunities including redevelopment of the existing fields, extensions of known productive horizons and exploration of higher impact targets at depth.
Since the award of the Tselfat exploration permit in 2006, we have been collecting, collating, digitizing and reviewing all of the existing well, production, seismic and other data. In addition, we shot a 175 square kilometer 3D seismic survey over the Brou Draa and Haricha fields. In 2009, we drilled the HR-33 bis well in the Haricha field to help assess whether there is the opportunity for redevelopment of the previously produced but abandoned Haricha field. We have put the HR-33 bis well on an extended production test to determine if the well is commercially viable. We commenced crude oil production in January 2011. The crude oil produced during the test is trucked approximately 200 kilometers to a refinery operated by SAMIR in Mohammedia, Morocco. If testing confirms the HR-33 bis well as a commercial well, we plan to delineate the oil field and apply for an exploitation concession and drill at least one additional well on the Haricha field. In 2010, we drilled the BTK-1 well and the GUW-1 well, which have both been plugged and abandoned after failing to discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. We plan to drill three exploration wells to a depth of at least 1,500 meters on the Tselfat exploration permit in 2011. We are the operator of the Tselfat exploration permit, which expires in June 2012.
Asilah. We own a 100% working interest in the two Asilah exploration permits (subject to a 25% participation interest by ONHYM once production is achieved), which cover an aggregate of approximately 681,000 acres (2,754 square kilometers) in northern Morocco. In July 2008, we entered into an agreement with Direct Morocco and Anschutz to farm-in to the Asilah exploration permits. In February 2011, we acquired all of the working interests in the Asilah exploration permits through our acquisition of Direct Morocco and Anschutz and terminated the agreement in March 2011. We conducted a 2D seismic survey in late 2008 and acquired 290 kilometers of 2D seismic data on the Asilah exploration permits. In December 2010, we commenced drilling the GRB-1 well which reached total depth in March 2011. The GRB-1 well targeted tertiary-aged reservoirs, and in 2011, we plan to test numerous intervals that had gas shows while drilling. We are the operator of the Asilah exploration permits, which expire in May 2012.
Ouezzane-Tissa. We own a 100% working interest in five Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits, which cover an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million acres (9,533 square kilometers) in northern Morocco. In July 2008, we entered into an agreement with Direct Morocco and Anschutz to farm-in to the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits. In February 2011, we acquired all of the working interests in the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits through our acquisition of Direct Morocco and Anschutz and terminated the agreement in March 2011. The first well, the OZW-1 well, encountered an extremely high
pressure water zone near 9,000 feet which we could not drill through and was plugged and abandoned. We drilled the second well, the HKE-1 well, which did not reach target depth and was plugged and abandoned. The third well, the HKE-1 bis well, did not discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities and is being plugged and abandoned. We plan to relinquish the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits in 2011, and upon ONHYM’s acceptance of our final report we expect to have $3.0 million in work commitment bank guarantees returned to us. We are the operator of the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permits.
Guercif. In June 2005, we were awarded the Guercif-Beni Znassen reconnaissance license covering 3.4 million acres (13,750 square kilometers) in northeastern Morocco. In January 2008, we converted a portion of our Guercif-Beni Znassen reconnaissance license into two exploration permits covering a total of 962,000 acres (3,893 square kilometers) in the Guercif area in northeastern Morocco, pursuant to a petroleum agreement with ONHYM. The Guercif exploration permits were for an eight-year term divided into three periods, each with a defined work program. Under the initial three-year work program, we re-entered, logged and tested the MSD-1 well, which we completed as a dry hole in the fourth quarter of 2008. The logs and test failed to establish the presence of hydrocarbons. In December 2010, we abandoned our interests in the Guercif exploration permits. As part of our agreement with ONHYM for the abandonment of the Guercif exploration permits, we transferred an obligation to drill one well from the Guercif exploration permits to the Tselfat exploration permit. Upon ONHYM’s acceptance of our final report, we expect to have $2.0 million in work commitment bank guarantees returned to us.
We lease an equipment yard in Meknes, and we currently have two drilling rigs located in Morocco. There are no reserves associated with our Moroccan properties as of December 31, 2010.
Commercial Terms. During the exploration phase of each exploration permit, we and our partners, if any, will operate and bear 100% of the costs to earn a 75% interest. Our interests are subject to the 25% interest held by ONHYM, which is carried by us and our partners, if any, during the exploration phase, all of which is governed by the applicable petroleum agreement. ONHYM pays its share of costs in the development phase. Once a discovery is made, the area covered by the discovery is converted into an exploitation concession, which is governed by the applicable association contract. Under an exploitation concession, we and our partners, if any, (75%) and ONHYM (25%) will each pay our respective share of costs. Upon conversion to an exploitation concession, we will pay a discovery bonus to ONHYM, and when certain sustained daily production levels are reached, we will pay one-time production bonuses. At Tselfat and Asilah, the discovery bonus at conversion is $500,000 and the one-time production bonuses are as follows: 15,000 Bbls/day-$750,000; 25,000 Bbls/day-$1 million; 35,000 Bbls/day-$2 million and 50,000 Bbls/day-$3 million. These production bonuses are deductible and are treated as development costs for Moroccan tax purposes. There is a ten-year tax holiday on revenues from petroleum production commencing in the year in which production begins. After ten years, the corporate tax rate is 30%. Oil and gas exploration activities are exempt from both value added tax and customs duties.
The royalty paid to the Moroccan government for onshore production is 10% on oil and 5% on gas. In addition, the first approximately 2.1 Mmbbl of oil production and the first approximately 11 billion cubic feet of gas production are exempt from royalty. Once an area is converted into an exploitation concession, we are required to pay annual surface rentals of $2.85 per acre.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Morocco for oil and gas concessions occurs in three stages: reconnaissance license, exploration permit and then exploitation concession.
Under a reconnaissance license, the government grants exploration rights for a one-year term to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, but not drilling. The size may be very large and generally is unexplored or under-explored. The reconnaissance license may be extended for up to one additional year. Interests under a reconnaissance license are not transferable. The recipient of a reconnaissance license commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. At the end of the term of the reconnaissance license, the license holder must designate one or more areas for conversion to an exploration permit or relinquish all rights.
An exploration permit, which is codified in a petroleum agreement with ONHYM, is for a term of up to eight years and covers an area not to exceed 2,000 square kilometers. Under an exploration permit, exploration and appraisal studies and operations are undertaken in order to establish the existence of oil and gas in commercially exploitable quantities. This generally entails the drilling of exploration wells to establish the presence of oil and/or gas and such additional appraisal wells as may be necessary to determine the limits and the productive capacity of a hydrocarbon deposit to determine whether or not to go forward to develop and produce the prospect. The eight-year term under an exploration permit is divided into three separate terms, each with a duration of two to three years. A distinct work program is negotiated for each separate term and the oil company then must post a bank guarantee to cover the cost of the work program for that term. The interests under an exploration permit are 75% to the oil company and 25% to ONHYM. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable. However, 100% of the costs of all activities under an exploration permit are borne by the oil company.
An exploitation concession is applied for upon the discovery of a commercially exploitable field. The concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The maximum duration of an exploitation concession is 25 years. Once an exploitation concession becomes effective, then the costs incurred for the development of the field are to be funded by the parties in proportion to their respective percentage interests, which is 75% to the oil company and 25% to ONHYM. The oil company serves as operator. The oil company and ONHYM enter into an association contract (similar to a joint operating agreement) to govern operations on the concession. Interests under an exploitation concession are transferable. All production is sold at market prices. A bonus (the amount of which is negotiated at the time of negotiation of a petroleum agreement) is paid to the government by the oil company upon conversion to an exploitation concession, and additional production bonuses are also paid when certain production levels from the exploitation concession are achieved. The levels of production and the amount of production bonuses are negotiated as part of a petroleum agreement.
Bulgaria
General. As of April 1, 2011, we owned interests in two onshore exploration permits in Bulgaria. We acquired all of our Bulgarian interests through the purchase of Direct Bulgaria in February 2011. The following is a map showing our interests in Bulgaria and Romania:
A-Lovech. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 3% overriding royalty interest, in the A-Lovech exploration permit, which covers approximately 565,000 acres (2,288 square kilometers) in northwestern Bulgaria. The A-Lovech permit contains the Deventci-R1 well, which discovered a reservoir in the Jurassic Orzirovo formation at a depth of approximately 4,200 meters. The well is currently producing approximately 250 Mcf of natural gas per day on a limited test basis, which is sold to a compressed natural gas facility adjacent to the Deventci-R1 well. We plan to appraise this discovery by drilling a second well, the Deventci-R2, on the A-Lovech permit in 2011. We are the operator of the A-Lovech permit, which expires in November 2011. We have submitted an application for a production concession covering approximately 160,000 acres of the A-Lovech permit.
The A-Lovech permit is also estimated to contain over 300,000 acres prospective for Etropole shale (at a depth of approximately 3,800 meters), which was recently certified as a geologic discovery by the Bulgarian government. We anticipate coring the Etropole shale interval, which will enhance the technical understanding of the potential of this shale play.
Aglen. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 1% overriding royalty interest, in the Aglen exploration permit, which covers approximately 1,700 acres (7 square kilometers) within the boundaries of the A-Lovech permit. The Aglen permit contains a prospective deep gas field that produced approximately 9.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas before being abandoned in the late 1990s. We are the operator of the Aglen permit, which expires in April 2012.
We do not own any drilling rigs in Bulgaria. There are no reserves associated with our Bulgarian properties as of December 31, 2010.
Commercial Terms. Bulgaria’s current petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties and income tax.
The royalty ranges from 2.5% to 30%, based on an “R factor” which is particular to each production concession agreement but is typically calculated by dividing the total cumulative revenues from a production concession by the total cumulative costs incurred for that production concession.
The production concession holder pays Bulgarian corporate income tax, which is assessed at a rate of 10%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes. Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Bulgaria are subject to a dividend withholding tax between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary for the conduct of petroleum operations. There is also a 19% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Bulgaria for oil and gas concessions occurs in two stages: exploration permit and then production concession.
Under an exploration permit, the government grants exploration rights for a term of up to five years to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, including drilling. The recipient of an exploration permit commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. The area covered by an onshore exploration permit may be as large as 5,000 square kilometers. The exploration permit may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms, subject to fulfillment of minimum work programs, and may be extended for an additional one-year term in order to appraise potential geologic discoveries. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable, subject to government approval. The permit holder is required to pay an annual area fee equal to 30 Bulgarian Leva (approximately $22) per square kilometer, or 45 Bulgarian Leva (approximately $33) per square kilometer in the event the permit term is extended.
Upon the registration of a commercial discovery, an exploration permit holder may apply for a production concession. The production concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The duration of a production concession is 35 years and may be extended by a further 15 years subject to the terms and conditions of the production concession agreement. Interests under a production concession are transferable, subject to government approval. No bonus is paid to the government by the oil company upon conversion to a production concession.
Romania
General. As of April 1, 2011, we owned an interest in one onshore production license in Romania, which was acquired through a farm-in agreement with Sterling in June 2009. The map showing our interest in Romania is on the previous page.
Sud Craiova. We own a 50% working interest in Sud Craiova Block E III-7, which covers approximately 1.5 million acres (6,070 square kilometers) in western Romania. In June 2009, we entered into an agreement with Sterling to farm-in to the Sud Craiova license. In exchange for a 50% working interest, we agreed to drill three exploration wells on the Sud Craiova license, each to a depth of approximately 3,280 feet (1,000 meters). We drilled three exploration wells at our cost on the Sud Craiova license in 2009 and 2010, all of which have been plugged and abandoned after failing to discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. We are currently reprocessing seismic data previously shot over the Sud Craiova license and plan to drill an exploration well to test the Silurian-aged shale formations at a depth of approximately 4,200 meters. Sterling is the operator of the Sud Craiova license, which expires in December 2013.
Izvoru, Vanatori and Marsa. In February 2006, we were awarded the Izvoru, Vanatori and Marsa production licenses, covering approximately 1,200 acres (5 square kilometers), 780 acres (4 square kilometers) and 188 acres (1 square kilometer), respectively. In 2009 and 2010, we drilled a total of five wells on the licenses, all of which were plugged and abandoned after failing to discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. In December 2010, we relinquished our interests in each of these three licenses.
We lease an equipment yard in Izvoru. We do not own any drilling rigs in Romania. There are no reserves associated with our Romanian properties as of December 31, 2010.
Commercial Terms. Romania’s current petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties, excise tax and income tax. Two forms of royalty are payable as:
•
a percentage of the value of gross production on a field basis, such percentage being fixed on a sliding scale depending on production levels. The production royalty rate varies between 3.5% to 13.5% for crude oil and between 3% to 13% for natural gas production; and
•
a fixed percentage of the gross income obtained from the transportation and transit of petroleum through the national pipeline system and from petroleum operations carried out through oil terminals belonging to the state. The royalty rate is currently fixed at 5%.
The license holder pays Romanian corporate income tax, but enjoys a one-year income tax holiday from the first day of production. Corporate income tax is assessed at a rate of 16%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes. Excise duty is payable on crude oil and natural gas at the rate of 4 Euro per ton of crude oil and 7.4 Euro per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas. Excise tax is not payable on crude oil or natural gas delivered as royalty to the Romanian government or on quantities directly exported. Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Romania are subject to a dividend withholding tax at between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary for the conduct of petroleum operations. There is also a 19% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The Ministry of Industry and Resources of Romania has responsibility for petroleum policy and strategy. The National Agency for Mineral Resources (“NAMR”) was set up in 1993 to administer and regulate petroleum operations. When licenses are to be made available, NAMR publishes a list of available blocks for concession in the Official Gazette. Foreign and Romanian companies must register their interest by a specified date and must submit applications by an application deadline. Applicants are required to prove their financial capacity, technical expertise and other requirements as required by NAMR. The licensing rounds are competitive and the winning bid is based on a scoring system.
NAMR negotiates the terms of agreements granting the licenses with the winning licensee and the license agreement is then submitted to the Romanian government for its approval. The date of government approval is the effective date of the license. Blocks which fail to attract a prescribed level of bids are re-offered in a subsequent licensing round. NAMR may issue a prospecting permit or a petroleum concession. A prospecting permit is for the conduct of geological mapping, magnetometry, gravimetry, seismology, geochemistry, remote sensing and drilling of wildcat wells in order to determine the general geological conditions favoring petroleum accumulations. A petroleum concession provides exclusive rights to conduct petroleum exploration and production under a petroleum agreement.
United States
California. Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired interests in three projects in the San Joaquin Valley in central California: farm-outs on the McFlurrey project and the South East Kettleman North Dome oil field and a small non-operated working interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit.
In February 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with our partner in the McFlurrey and South East Kettleman North Dome farm-outs to settle certain disagreements between us and our partner. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we resigned as operator of the farm-outs and transferred ownership of the two McFlurrey wells to the partner, subject to our obligation to plug and abandon the first well at our cost, which we have accomplished. In addition, we paid the partner for our share of the costs of plugging and abandoning, and cleaning up and restoring the surface and well site of the second well. We paid a total of $84,000 to plug, abandon and restore the two wells.
We own a non-operated working interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit located in Kings County, California. This unit produces approximately 150 gross Bbls (approximately 8 net Bbls) of oil per day along with small amounts of associated natural gas. We own a 5% interest in five existing wells on the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit (three are currently producing). On all new projects and well proposals submitted and completed after May 16, 2008, we will own a 10% non-operated working interest. We are currently seeking purchasers for our interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit.
Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, we lease two properties, one in Dewey County (128 net acres) and one in McClain County (29 net acres). We own a 20% non-operated working interest in a well on the Dewey County property that is currently producing a small amount of oil and natural gas.
There are no reserves associated with our U.S. properties as of December 31, 2010.
Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves
All of our net proved, probable and possible reserves are located in Turkey. The following table summarizes our net proved, probable and possible reserves in Turkey at December 31, 2010 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, PV-10 and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2010:
(1) Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure:
Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
At December 31, 2010, our estimated proved reserves were 16,674 Mboe, an increase of 43.1% compared to 11,649 Mboe at December 31, 2009. During 2010, we added estimated proved reserves of 321 Mboe through extensions and discoveries driven by our 2010 drilling activity in Turkey, 2,250 Mboe through the acquisition of Amity and Petrogas and 3,429 Mboe through significant additions in proved undeveloped reserves at the Selmo oil field, which were offset by production volumes of 975 Mboe.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2010, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 8,326 Mboe, an increase of 60.1% compared to 5,202 Mboe at December 31, 2009. This increase in proved undeveloped reserves is primarily attributable to additions to proved undeveloped reserves at the Selmo oil field and was partially offset by proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves at the Edirne gas field. There were 1,548 Mboe proved undeveloped reserves that were converted to proved developed reserves due to 17 proved undeveloped well locations that were drilled and placed in production in 2010. During 2010, we incurred $19.6 million in capital expenditures to drill and bring on-line these 17 proved undeveloped wells. At December 31, 2010, no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves. We intend to convert the proved undeveloped reserves disclosed as of December 31, 2010 to proved developed reserves within five years of the date they were initially disclosed as proved undeveloped reserves.
Probable Reserves
Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
At December 31, 2010, our estimated probable reserves were 11,726 Mboe. Increases in probable reserves during 2010 were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Amity and Petrogas in August 2011.
Possible Reserves
Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserve where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir. Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage of recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be
assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
At December 31, 2010, our estimated possible reserves were 41,824 Mboe. Increases in possible reserves during 2010 were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Amity and Petrogas in August 2011.
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain an outside independent engineering firm to prepare estimates of our proved, probable and possible reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Our internal audit department has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2010. Senior management reviews and approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of three outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves, and we are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves, using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves presented as of December 31, 2010 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our external engineers. The technical person at DeGolyer and MacNaughton that is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. He has over 28 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations, is a member of the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with DeGolyer and MacNaughton to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them for the preparation of their reserves estimates. Our internal senior reservoir engineer is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve estimation process. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. He has over 37 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including experience in operations, drilling and reservoir engineering, and is a member of multiple professional organizations.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Note 21-Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves and standard measure information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved, probable and possible reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a detailed review of our Selmo, Arpatepe, Bakuk and Thrace Basin properties in Turkey. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the
criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
Oil and Gas Reserves under Canadian Law
As a reporting issuer under Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario securities laws, we are required under Canadian law to comply with National Instrument 51-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities” (“NI 51-101”) implemented by the members of the Canadian Securities Administrators in all of our reserves related disclosures. DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated the Company’s reserves as of December 31, 2010 in accordance with the reserves definitions of NI 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluators Handbook (“COGEH”). Our annual oil and gas reserves disclosures prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and COGEH and filed in Canada are available at www.sedar.com.

Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth the number of net productive and dry exploratory wells and net productive and dry development wells we drilled for 2010, 2009 and 2008:
Current Operations
We are in the process of integrating the Amity, Petrogas and Direct Bulgaria properties, equipment and personnel into our operations. We have substantially integrated the Incremental, Talon, Anschutz and Direct Morocco acquisitions and organized our activities in Turkey into a service division consisting of two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Viking International and Viking Geophysical, and into an exploration and production division consisting of six wholly-owned exploration and production subsidiaries: TEMI, TAT, Talon, DMLP, Amity and Petrogas.
As of April 1, 2011, we were producing an aggregate of approximately 2,767 Bbls of oil per day from the Selmo and Arpatepe oil fields and approximately 15.9 Mmcf of natural gas per day in the Thrace Basin and were engaged in the following drilling and exploration activities.
Turkey. We are drilling two wells at Selmo and two wells in the Thrace Basin. In addition, we are completing two wells at Selmo and testing and completing the Kalatepe-1 well on License 4175. We are testing and commissioning the recently completed 23 kilometer, 6-inch pipeline from the Bakuk-101 well to an existing pipeline to the south and expect to begin limited natural gas sales in the second quarter of 2011. We are now evaluating options for further appraisal of the reservoir. We are constructing a 20 kilometer, 10-inch pipeline to carry natural gas from the Alpullu gas field in the Thrace Basin to an existing pipeline. We are conducting a 236 kilometer 2D seismic shoot on License 4350.
Morocco. We have constructed water separation facilities at the HR-33 bis well on the Tselfat exploration permit and are conducting an extended production test on that well.
Bulgaria. We are evaluating potential locations for the planned Deventci-R2 well, which will appraise the Orzirovo formation and core the Etropole shale formation.
Romania. We are evaluating a potential exploration well to test a potential Jurassic oil play and reprocessing seismic data previously shot over the Sud Craiova license.
Planned 2011 Operations
We continue to actively explore and develop our existing oil and gas properties in Turkey, Morocco and Bulgaria and evaluate the opportunities for further activities in Romania. Our success will depend in part on discovering additional hydrocarbons in commercial quantities and then bringing these discoveries into production. In 2011, we are focused on accomplishing the following objectives:
•
Increasing Production. Our goal is to achieve a production rate of 10,000 Boe per day in Turkey by the end of 2011. We plan to increase our crude oil and natural gas production in Turkey through continuous drilling in Selmo and the Thrace Basin, the completion of pipelines to bring shut-in gas to market, the application of modern well stimulation techniques such as gelled acidizing and fracture stimulation, and the introduction of directional drilling.
•
Securing Partners to Reduce Exploration Risk. We are actively seeking partners for our exploration acreage in Turkey, Morocco, Bulgaria and Romania. Through farm-outs, we expect to reduce our exploration risk and accelerate the exploration and development activities on the farmed-out properties. We have begun consolidating and analyzing well data and seismic data for our properties in Bulgaria and our exploration acreage in Turkey. It is our intention to remain as operator in the properties that we farm-out.
•
Integrating Acquisitions. We expect to complete the acquisition of TBNG and Pinnacle in the second quarter of 2011, which will bring additional acreage, production, personnel and equipment into our Turkey operations. We will continue to integrate the recent acquisitions of Amity, Petrogas and Direct Bulgaria.
Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to range between $125.0 million and $150.0 million. Approximately 50% of these anticipated expenditures will occur in the Thrace Basin in Turkey, devoted to developing conventional and unconventional natural gas production, building infrastructure and acquiring seismic data. Approximately 35% of these anticipated expenditures will occur in southeastern Turkey, devoted to developing crude oil production at Selmo and Arpatepe and drilling exploratory wells on various licenses. The balance of the estimated budget is divided between exploration activities in Morocco and Romania. We are seeking a joint venture partner to fund our anticipated capital expenditures in Bulgaria in 2011. If cash on hand, borrowings from our senior secured credit facility and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, then we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. We currently plan to execute the following drilling and exploration activities in 2011:
Turkey. We plan to drill approximately 90-100 wells during 2011, including wells to be drilled on acreage held by TBNG, which we expect to acquire in the second quarter of 2011. If we do not complete the acquisition of TBNG, the number of wells we expect to drill in 2011 may change. We also plan to construct the infrastructure necessary to produce and sell oil and natural gas from the productive wells we drill.
Morocco. On our Tselfat exploration permit, we are currently producing oil from the HR-33 bis well on an extended production test to determine if the well is commercially viable. If testing confirms the HR-33 bis well as a commercial well, we plan to delineate the oil field, apply for an exploitation concession and drill at least one additional well in the Haricha field. We also plan to drill the TKN-1 well to test another 3D seismic prospect that is similar to the Haricha field. If the TKN-1 well is a commercial well, we would likely drill an additional appraisal well. We plan to drill three exploration wells to a depth of at least 1,500 meters on the Tselfat exploration permit in 2011. On our Asilah exploration permit, we are planning to test the recently completed GRB-1 well, which had substantial gas shows during drilling. If that well is completed as a commercial well we would likely drill additional appraisal wells and develop plans to commercialize those wells.
Bulgaria. We plan to drill the Deventci-R2 well on the A-Lovech exploration permit to appraise the Deventci-R1 well gas discovery. While drilling the appraisal well on the A-Lovech permit, we plan to test the productivity of the Etropole shale interval. We may also drill an additional appraisal well on the Aglen exploration permit. If the appraisal well on the Aglen permit is successful, we anticipate planning the construction of a pipeline to connect the Deventci wells to a natural gas pipeline to the south. We are seeking to enter into a joint venture where the joint venture partner would carry us in the capital expenditures incurred in Bulgaria in 2011.
Romania. We plan to drill an exploration well to test the Silurian-aged shale formations present on the Sud Craiova license. We may also drill an exploration well to test the Coyote oil prospect on the southeastern portion of the Sud Craiova license.
Drilling Services Business. We plan to continue to increase drilling services revenues by providing drilling services and seismic acquisition services to third parties in Turkey and northern Iraq.
