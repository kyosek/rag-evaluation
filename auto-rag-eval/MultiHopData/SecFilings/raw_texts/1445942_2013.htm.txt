ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Executive and Field Offices
Our headquarters are located at 539 El Paso Street, Sierra Blanca, Texas 79851. The El Paso warehouse located at 11459 Pellicano Dr., El Paso, Texas was terminated in June 2013. We have moved our accounting functions to our former office in Tyler, Texas under the supervision of our largest current stockholder and former CFO, G. W. McDonald.
Overview of the Round Top Rare Earth-Uranium-Beryllium Project
We are currently in the exploration stage and have not established that our Round Top Project contains Proven or Probable Reserves as defined under SEC Guide 7.
Description and Access
Round Top is a small mountain, one of a group of five that comprises the Sierra Blanca, located in Hudspeth County approximately eight miles northwest of the town of Sierra Blanca. The property is reached by truck on a private dirt road that turns north off Interstate 10 access road approximately one mile west of the town of Sierra Blanca. A railroad line is located approximately one to three miles from the Round Top Project and a spur line stops at a stone quarry within three miles of the Round Top Project.
On March 14, 2013, we purchased the surface lease at the Round Top Project, known as the West Lease, from the Foundation for $500,000 cash and 1,063,830 shares of our common stock. We also agreed to support the Foundation through an annual payment of $45,000 for ten years to support conservation efforts within the Rio Grande Basin and in particular engaging in stewardship of Lake Amistad, a large and well-known fishing lake near Del Rio, Texas. The West Lease comprises approximately 54,990 acres and is fully paid until 2028, thereby having a lease value of approximately $293,000. Most importantly, purchase of the surface lease gave us unrestricted surface access for the potential development and mining of our Round Top Project.

Acquisition and Ownership
Prospecting Permits
TRER currently holds prospecting permits covering land in Hudspeth County. The prospecting permits allow for exploration activities on approximately 9,345 acres. Currently, TRER has yet to complete drilling on lands identified within the permits due to the requirement of completing archeological studies. TRER intends to complete archeological studies in all areas for future exploration. To date, all exploration work has occurred on areas with approved archeological assessments. A summary of the prospecting permits is listed in Table 1 below:
Table 1 TRER Permit Numbers and Associated Acres
TRER has approximately 9,345 acres under annual prospecting permits with the State of Texas. TRER entered into the prospecting permits on September 24, 2011 and all are renewable on or before the anniversary date at a cost $1.00 per acre
September 2011 Lease
On September 2, 2011, we entered into a new mining lease with the Texas General Land Office covering Sections 7 and 18 of Township 7, Block 71 and Section 12 of Block 72, covering approximately 860 acres at Round Top Mountain in Hudspeth County, Texas. The mining lease issued by the Texas General Land Office gives us the right to explore, produce, develop, mine, extract, mill, remove, and market beryllium, uranium, rare earth elements, all other base and precious metals, industrial minerals and construction materials and all other minerals excluding oil, gas, coal, lignite, sulfur, salt, and potash. The term of the lease is nineteen years so long as minerals are produced in paying quantities.
Under the lease, we will pay the State of Texas a lease bonus of $142,518; $44,718 of which was paid upon the execution of the lease, and $97,800 which will be due when we submit a supplemental plan of operations to conduct mining. Upon the sale of minerals removed from Round Top, we will pay the State of Texas a $500,000 minimum advance royalty.
Thereafter, we will pay the State of Texas a production royalty equal to eight percent (8%) of the market value of uranium and other fissionable materials removed and sold from Round Top and six and one quarter percent (6 1/4%) of the market value of all other minerals removed and sold from Round Top.
Thereafter, assuming production of paying quantities has not been obtained, we may pay additional delay rental fees to extend the term of the lease for successive one (1) year periods pursuant to the following schedule:
In August 2013, we paid the State of Texas a delay rental of $44,718.

In August 2013, we paid the State of Texas a delay rental to extend the term of the lease in an amount equal to $4,500.
Geology
The Round Top Project area lies within the Texas Lineament Zone or Trans-Pecos Trend. The lineament is a northwest trending structural zone where Laramide thrust faulting followed by basin and range normal faulting were active. Tertiary igneous activity is also associated with the lineament zone, both intrusive and extrusive.
Locally the project area is characterized by five Tertiary microgranite bodies that intruded Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. The microgranites occur as laccoliths, mushroom-shaped bodies emplaced at relatively shallow depths. At the current erosional levels, laccoliths form resistant peaks with relief up to 2,000 feet. The microgranites, which are called rhyolites in the literature, are enriched with various metals which may or not be economical to recover. The rare earth elements are located with-in the intrusive rhyolite body.
Tertiary Diorite which predate the microgranites are intruded the cretaceous section. The diorites occur as sills, five to 100 feet thick and less frequently as dikes and plugs. Sedimentary rocks exposed in the area are middle to upper Cretaceous limestones shales and sandstones. The limestone, where it is in contact with the microgranites, is the host for Beryllium and uranium mineralization.
The Round Top Project was initially developed in the late 1980's as a beryllium resource. During the course of the beryllium exploration, approximately 200 drill holes penetrated varying thicknesses of the rhyolite volcanic rock that makes up the mass of Round Top Mountain and caps the beryllium-uranium deposits which occur in the underlying limestone; some 50 more holes were drilled on Little Round Top, Sierra Blanca and Little Blanca Mountains.
The Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, working with the project geologists, conducted an investigation of the rhyolite to better understand its rare metal content. This research shows that the rhyolite laccoliths at Sierra Blanca are enriched in a variety of REEs and other rare elements such as tantalum, niobium, thorium and lithium. They analyzed a series of samples from outcrop and drill holes and studied the geochemistry and mineralogy of the rhyolite. The results of their research were published in the GSA, Geological Society of America, Special Paper 246, 1990.
Mineralization
Round Top rhyolite is enriched in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs). Statistical review of the current data shows that an estimated 70% of the total REE’s grade being HREEs. REE mineralization occurs primarily as disseminated microcrystals of varieties of fluorite (such as yttrium-rich yttrofluorite) where HREEs have substituted for calcium, and as other REE-bearing accessory minerals. REE minerals occur mainly in vugs and as crystal coatings, suggesting late-stage crystallization from an incompatible element-rich fluid.
The Round Top rhyolite was divided into five different alteration phases based on the intensity of hematitic and hydrothermal alteration: red rhyolite, pink rhyolite, tan rhyolite; brown rhyolite and gray rhyolite. Hematitic alteration is a replacement of the magnetite by hematite and gives the rhyolite a red to pink color. Hydrothermal alteration was late and gives the rhyolite a tan to brown color. Mostly unaltered, gray rhyolite was also documented.
Initial geochemical testwork, presented in Section 13, suggests that the gray and pink rhyolite units have the highest REE content, averaging between 554 and 615 parts per million (ppm) total REE + Yttrium (Y). Red and tan rhyolites, which may be strongly vapor-phase altered, contain about 8% lower abundance of REE and the brown rhyolite, which may be altered hydrothermally or by groundwater, contains about 23% less REE than the gray and pink varieties.
Metallurgy
The Round Top Project rhyolite requires further evaluation of its mineralogical makeup and economic modeling to determine the appropriate course for potential future commercial development. However, the size of this rhyolite deposit, the high percentage (68-72%) of heavy rare earth elements to the total rare earth elements and the leaching characteristics of the host rock could make a heap leach mine a viable option at lower capital costs than the mine plan described in our current PEA released June 22 2012. The Preliminary Economic Assessment is mentioned here for informational purposes only and is not incorporated herein by reference.
On October 27, 2011, we announced that we had completed Phase I of its metallurgical testing and characterization. This mineralogical study reconfirmed that the rare earth minerals are finely disseminated throughout the rhyolite host rock. Based on the initial ore characterization, this testing reconfirms the simplistic rare earth element mineral associations, which suggests favorable metallurgical processing options. Phase II was focused on pre-concentration evaluation and other diagnostic testing including acid leaching of the rare earth minerals. The results of this testing is described in the PEA..
On May 8, 2013, we announced independent confirmation of potential favorable heap leach characteristics, based on coarse leach testing at an independent lab. The results are summarized below:
*La=Lanthanum, Ce= Cerium, Pr= Praseodymium, Nd= Neodymium, Sm= Samarium, Eu= Europium, Gd= Gadolinium, Tb= Terbium, Dy=Dysprosium, Ho= Holmium, Er= Erbium, Tm= Thulium, Lu= Lutetium, Yb= Ytterbium, Y= Yttrium, Th=Thorium, U= Uranium, Be= Beryllium, Li= Lithium
A sieved 2 to 4 mm (~1/8th to 1/4 inch) fraction of the composite rhyolite sample being used for all metallurgical testing was submitted. This sample was leached in 14.7 gm/l (14.7% by wt) sulfuric acid at room temperature for two weeks.
On July 16, 2013, we announced the results of an independent heap leach scoping study static leach test which confirmed recoveries up to 79.9%. The test results indicated the following:
1. Comparison of the calculated heads and the assayed heads for the elements of interest are similar. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the minerals are fairly uniformly distributed in the deposit.
2. Extractions for Yttrium varied from 20.8 to 61.1% for the different sizes with a combined extraction of 48.6%. Extractions for Dysprosium varied from 23.8% to57.7% with a combined extraction of 44.5%.
3. The highest extractions for all minerals of interest were in the ½ in X ¼ in size fractions. The extractions dropped significantly in the minus ¼ in size fraction.
4. The acid consumption was reasonable for the coarse size fractions (>1/2 inch) and more than doubled for the minus ¼ inch material.
On September 30, 2013, we announced the results of preliminary column leach testing. Preliminary column leach testing of Round Top rhyolite crushed to 1/2 inch has yielded the following recoveries of the heavy rare earth elements (terbium and heavier) plus yttrium. These tests were run for 60 days with 7.5 wt. percent sulfuric acid. Recoveries of the heavy rare earth elements plus Yttrium were as follows:
Yttrium (Y):
91%
Dysprosium (Dy):
87%
Lutetium (Lu):
67%
Holmium (Ho):
86%
Erbium (Er):
83%
Thulium (Tm):
77%
Ytterbium (Yb):
74%
Terbium (Tb):
87%
While concurrent work on the froth floatation and agitated leaching of the concentrates yielded acceptable recoveries, the whole rock column leach testing indicates better overall recoveries at potentially lower capital and operating costs. This rock also shows other very favorable heap leach characteristics with ore slump of 0.18%, ore wt. loss of 2.25% and retained moisture of 6.4%.
Work will continue to optimize the recoveries of the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and yttrium as well as potentially valuable by-products such as uranium, beryllium and lithium and the light rare earth elements (LREE).
Project Exploration History
The Round Top rare earths and uranium-beryllium prospects were initially drilled in 1984 and 1985, during which time the ore body known as the "West End Ore Zone" was discovered by Cabot Corporation. In subsequent years, Cyprus Minerals Corporation took over the exploration activities. Cyprus drilled additional exploration holes and also put an adit into the ore zone where 1,115 feet of underground workings were driven. Cyprus developed the underground workings in order to obtain bulk samples for pilot plant testing and beryllium oxide concentrate generation. Cyprus ultimately put the project on hold as a result of poor beryllium market conditions. Cyprus eventually allowed the lease with the state of Texas to lapse.
In March 2011, the Company completed an analysis of 1,103 drill samples from the 1984-88 drilling program initially conducted on the Round Top Project by third party operators. All or a portion of forty-six out of an estimated two hundred fifty existing drill holes have been re-logged and re-analyzed. The rare earth element and other metals are consistent with the original study by the Texas Bureau of Geology that was published in the Geological Society of America, Special Paper 246 in 1990. This study first described the rare metal content of the large mass of intrusive igneous rock that makes up the body of Round Top Mountain, and is the basis for our interest in this deposit. The nine drill holes cited below were selected because they are widely distributed and roughly define an area approximately six thousand feet by four thousand feet within the approximate seven thousand foot known diameter of the intrusive rhyolite body. They intersected the entire body of the rhyolite.
On October 27, 2011, we announced favorable results of our Phase I metallurgical testing and characterization that reconfirmed that the rare earth minerals are finely disseminated throughout the rhyolite host rock at our Round Top Project.
On November 8, 2011, we announced that our supplementary operating plan to expand exploration activities at our Round Top Project had been approved by the Texas General Land Office (GLO); the expanded development and exploration drill plan now calls for an additional 40 drill holes and 4 diamond core holes for an estimated planned drilled footage of 20,000 feet.
On November 10, 2011, we announced that Gustavson Associates, LLC, a subsidiary of Walsh Environmental Scientists and Engineers and its parent company, Ecology and Environment, Inc. (NASDAQ: EEI) had been contracted to perform the scoping study at the Round Top Project. On June 15, 2012, we issued a press release regarding the results of our Preliminary Economic Assessment.
On June 22, 2012, we filed our PEA for our Round Top Project, entitled “NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment Round Top Project, Sierra Blanca, Texas,” dated June 22, 2012, effective as of May 15, 2012, with securities regulatory authorities in Canada. On June 26, 2012, the PEA was furnished to, not filed with, the Commission on Form 8-K to satisfy our “public disclosure” obligations under Regulation FD of the Exchange Act. The PEA is mentioned here for informational purposes only and is not incorporated herein reference.
Cautionary Note to Investors: The mineral estimates in the PEA have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. The terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information in the Preliminary Economic Assessment contains descriptions of our mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Our project as described in the PEA currently does not contain any known proven or probable ore reserves under SEC Guide 7 reporting standards. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in the Registrant’s latest reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. You can review and obtain copies of these filings at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources in these categories will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 compliant reserves.
Exploration and Engineering Costs
To date we have incurred exploration costs at the Round Top Project of approximately $10.5 million. In the fiscal year ending August 31, 2013 our total exploration costs were approximately $1.28 million. We anticipate that our exploration costs for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2014 will be approximately $682,000, which will consist primarily of metallurgical expenses. We expect that our current cash balance will be enough to meet our exploration costs for the next fiscal year.
Improvements, Equipment, Power and Water
The Round Top rare earth prospect was initially developed in the late 1980s as a beryllium resource. As a result, several pieces of equipment were present at the property when we acquired the lease, some of which we have repaired as described below. The previous operators had also built out several roads at the prospect site, which we believe are suitable for our current exploration plans.
There exists on the Round Top site a 1,115 foot, 10 foot by 10 foot decline from the surface into the Round Top prospect. There are steel sets every five feet, in some cases less, and the entire working is lagged with timber. There are “escape holes” at intervals to allow personnel to avoid equipment. The escape holes are all in good operating condition. There is also a 36 foot steel ventilation line in place that runs for approximately 75 feet into the prospect. There is a 125 hp axial plane ventilation fan in place. We have leveled the fan and rehabilitated the control panel, and have operated this ventilation system during the evaluation of the historic Cabot-Cyprus work. We intend to install a "soft start" motor starter switch for the vent fan in the future in order to be able to use a 100kw generator.
A bag house is also located on the property that will need its electronic controls rehabilitated and modernized and filters installed. There is a 6" Victaulic compressed air line extending from the compressor station outside to the faces. There are numerous valves at strategic locations underground. There is one 2' steel Victaulic water line for drill water and an additional partly plastic Victaulic water line for dust suppression sprayers, which also has sprayers in place.
There is electric cable from the portal to the face and a switch box underground. Some additional switching gear will need to be installed at the portal. The mine portal has a sturdy locking steel door in place that we have reconditioned.
There is a 500 barrel (23,000 gal) water tank below the mine dump for water to be hauled in and stored. This tank appears to be in good shape. The water line from the tank to the mine portal is missing and will have to be replaced. The water system will need a submersible pump, switching gear and approximately 1000 ft of 2” poly line to render the water system serviceable.
The nearest population center to the Round Top Project is Sierra Blanca, Texas. The town of Sierra Blanca is approximately six miles to the southeast of the Round Top Project site. The population was 533 in 2000 and 510 during the 2007 census. Skilled mining labor and support could be found in El Paso, approximately 85 miles to the northeast.
A major rail line parallels Interstate 10 approximately three to four miles west and south of the mine site. Approximately three miles from the Project site is a commercial rock quarry in operation which produces ballast for the railroad. The rock quarry operation has a rail road spur which is approximately two to three miles from the Project.
Power is currently supplied to Sierra Blanca through El Paso Electric Services. El Paso Electric Services has approximately 1,643 megawatts of generating capacity. The existing 69 kV line will have to be upgraded from either Caliente or Sparks stations near El Paso. Approximately 75 to 90 miles of line will have to be upgraded for operation of the plant. It is likely that power during construction will be provided by a temporary 69 kV line from the Sierra Blanca transmission line and on-site generators. An actual source of power has not been determined but all potential power suppliers will be evaluated. Upgrading of the El Paso Electric Services transmission lines will be required no matter which power option is selected.
Water for the project may be obtained from four potential groundwater sources: Red Light Draw/Eagle Flats, Wild Horse/Michigan Flats, the Diablo Plateau aquifer, and the Bone Springs-Victoria Peak aquifer near Dell city in Hudspeth County. The Wild Horse/Michigan Flats and the Bone Spring-Victoria Peak aquifers are all located within groundwater conservation districts and would provide potential permitting hurdles as compared to either Red Light Draw or Eagle Flats. TRER currently is pursuing an agreement with the GLO for exploration into the Red Light Draw area. A report produced by LGB-Guyton Associates a specialty groundwater and environmental engineering consultant has identified Red Light draw as the primary target for water supply for TRER. LGB-Guyton Associates evaluated the groundwater potential simplistically with a ground water model to confirm the source was able to provide 6,000 to 12,000 acre feet/year pumping rates. The quality of the water is expected to be adequate for process water needs and the water will require treatment to be potable.
Located approximately 28 miles to the north of the Round Top Project area is a transcontinental natural gas pipeline. The pipeline, with an eight-inch diameter pipe, is owned and operated by El Paso Natural Gas. The pipeline allows for the Project to consider utilizing an off take from the pipeline to the plant site for heating of the processing and management buildings. The use of the natural gas versus a propane system on site will need to be evaluated further. Expected uses of the propane/natural gas would be for heating the administration and process mine facilities, as well as for potentially increasing the temperature of the leach acid to a specified temperature. No large demand propane or natural gas fuel requirements are foreseen. Capital assessment assumes propane fuel basis.
