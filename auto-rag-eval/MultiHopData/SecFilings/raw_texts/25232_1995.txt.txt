A "negative investment" in a joint venture results from distributions of capital to the Company, if any, exceeding the sum of (i) the Company's contributions of capital and (ii) reported earnings (losses) of the joint venture allocated to the Company. "Investment" in a joint venture means the book value of the Company's investment in the joint venture.

Pei, including 7 office buildings (of which 2 are under construction) containing 2,172,000 rentable square feet.

The Wildwood complex overlooks the Chattahoochee River and borders 1,200 acres of national forest, thus providing an urban office facility in a forest setting.

At December 31, 1995, the Company's investment in Wildwood Associates and a related partnership (see "Summit Green") was approximately $2.2 million, which included the cost of the land the Company is committed to contribute to Wildwood Associates.

Commencing January 1994, a single tenant, TSW International, Inc., leased the building for a term of ten years. The lease was initially for 60% of the building with options permitting the tenant to expand its occupancy to the remainder of the building over the next several years; the first such option for an additional 10% of the space was exercised in the fourth quarter of 1994. In addition, the 3100 Windy Hill Road Building, a 188,000 rentable square foot corporate training facility occupies a 13-acre parcel of land which is wholly owned by the Company. The training facility improvements were sold in 1983 to a limited partnership of private investors, at which time the Company received a leasehold mortgage note. The training facility land was simultaneously leased to the partnership for thirty years, along with certain equipment for varying periods. The training facility was 100% leased by the partnership to IBM through November 1993. In January 1993, the IBM lease was extended through November 30, 1998. Concurrently with the IBM extension, the mortgage note and related leases were also modified (see Note 3).

(2%), owns a 20% interest in the partnership that owns One Ninety One Peachtree Tower.

The balance of the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project is owned by DIHC Peachtree Associates, an affiliate of DIHC.
Through C-H Associates, CREC received 50% of the development fees from the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. In addition, CREC owns a 50% interest in two general partnerships which receive fees from leasing and managing the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project.
The One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was funded substantially by debt until March 1993, at which time DIHC Peachtree Associates contributed equity in the amount of $145,000,000. Subsequent to the equity contribution, C-H Associates is entitled to a priority distribution of $250,000 per year (of which the Company is entitled to receive $112,500) for seven years beginning in 1993.

The partnership acquired the property in 1991 for a nominal cash investment, subject to a ten-year purchase money note. This 8% purchase money note had an outstanding balance of $21.0 million at December 31, 1995. If the purchase money note is paid in accordance with its terms, it will amortize to approximately $15.3 million ($59 per rentable square foot) over the ten-year term of the Coca-Cola lease, at which time Coca-Cola is entitled to receive the preferred return described below and the property may be sold, released, or returned to the lender under the purchase money note for $1.00 without penalty or any further liability to the Company for the indebtedness. At December 31, 1995, the Company had a negative investment in Ten Peachtree Place Associates of $39,000.
