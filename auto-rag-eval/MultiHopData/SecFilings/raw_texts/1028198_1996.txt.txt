ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The 1290 Property
The 1290 Property Owning Partnership holds the fee title to the 1290 Property and all improvements thereon. The 1290 Property, completed in 1963, is a 43-story, first class commercial office building with approximately 1,964,000 rentable square feet of space. The building is centrally located in midtown Manhattan and is connected to the famed "Rockefeller Center" complex via an underground passageway.
The average occupancy rates for the 1290 Property for the years 1992 through 1996 were 97%, 98%, 94%, 78% and 90%, respectively.
As of December 31, 1996, the 1290 Property was approximately 95% leased and there were leases and license agreements with 37 tenants and 4 licensees covering approximately 1,865,000 rentable square feet of space. As of December 31, 1996, the annual average rent (including electricity and additional rent payable on account of operating expenses and real estate tax escalations) for office space leased in the building was approximately $39.70 per square foot. As of December 31, 1996, approximately 47,000 square feet of space was under lease to retail tenants, at an average annual rent (including electricity and additional rent payable on account of operating and real estate tax escalations) of approximately $68.35 per rentable square foot. As of December 31, 1996, approximately 99,000 rentable square feet of office and retail space was available for rent.
The building serves as the corporate headquarters of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable"). In addition to Equitable, the building houses a variety of tenants, including law firms, financial institutions and entertainment companies.
The following table summarizes certain information regarding the largest leases at the 1290 Property as of December 31, 1996:
(1) Leased square footage does not include approximately 14,400 square feet of storage space.
(2) Annual Base Rent means the amount contractually due (excluding adjustments related to recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance charges, taxes, utilities or other items and rent concessions) for the calendar month ending December 31, 1996, annualized. The Company believes that base rent is a conservative and appropriate measure for comparative purposes of commercial real estate rental revenue from office building properties that do not generate percentage rents based on sales.
(3) Gross Rent means Annual Base Rent plus recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance charges, taxes, utilities and other items. Information necessary to compute effective rent, including rent concessions, leasing commissions and tenant improvements is not available with respect to leases entered into prior to the date the Properties were acquired by the Property Owning Partnerships.
(4) The lease agreement with Equitable provides for the delivery of space to Equitable in three separate blocks; Block A, comprising 287,664 rentable square feet, Block B, comprising 135,528 rentable square feet and Block C, comprising 79,288 rentable square feet. Equitable is currently in possession of the space designated as Blocks A and B, and is entitled to a free rent period through June 1997 with respect to Block A and through October 1997 with respect to Block B. The space designated as Block C is currently occupied by another tenant and such space will be delivered to Equitable on March 1, 1999. Equitable is entitled to a free rent period through December 1999 with respect to Block C. In addition to free rent, Equitable is entitled to a credit against rent of up to approximately $1,625,000 for all three blocks as reimbursement for the cost of certain tenant improvements made by and paid for by Equitable.

(11) Other Office and Retail Tenants includes 79,288 square feet of office space currently occupied by a tenant that is to be delivered to Equitable on March 1, 1999, as disclosed in footnote (4). Other Office and Retail Tenants also includes 24,380 square feet of office space currently occupied by a tenant that is to be delivered to Warner on June 30, 1998, as disclosed in footnote (6).
A major capital project at the 1290 Property which included a renovation of the building's lobby was substantially completed in December 1996. The total budget for the project was $7,700,000 with approximately $900,000 remaining to be paid as of December 31, 1996. Anticipated expenditures for other capital projects for the 1290 Property in 1997 are approximately $2,746,000 and relate primarily to: (i) the commencement of an elevator modernization program; (ii) conversion of a refrigeration machine (in accordance with the 1992 Clean Air Act); (iii) the replacement of the main roof and the repair of certain roof setbacks; and (iv) removal of asbestos in several mechanical rooms. Capital expenditures in future years are estimated to be $1,000,000 per annum, and relate primarily to the continuation of the elevator modernization program.
An environmental report prepared for the Properties indicates that the 1290 Property contains asbestos or asbestos containing materials in several mechanical rooms and certain other locations. The total cost of removing the asbestos in accordance with the operations and maintenance plan for the 1290 Property is estimated to be approximately $2,000,000 and the removal is anticipated to occur over a two-year period.
The following table shows anticipated lease expirations on an aggregate basis for the period for each calendar year from 1997 through and including 2006. Such chart assumes that there are no early terminations of leases and that leases expire without extension by existing tenants pursuant to lease options.
Annual real estate taxes assessed against the 1290 Property for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $17,300,250, $19,023,178 and $19,094,400, respectively, which amounts were calculated on assessed values of approximately $168,750,000, $189,000,000 and $180,000,000, respectively. See -- "Tax Certiorari Proceedings and Tenant Reimbursement Claims."

Other Assets
Tenant Notes Receivable
An affiliate of O&Y was the holder of a note (the "Robinson Silverman Note") issued by Robinson Silverman Pearce & Aronsohn ("Robinson Silverman") dated April 1, 1989 in the face amount of $6,500,000 and a maturity date of September 1, 1999, which note was executed in connection with Robinson Silverman's lease at the 1290 Property. The Robinson Silverman Note was assigned to the 1290 Property Owning Partnership on the Effective Date. In 1991 and 1992, Robinson Silverman claimed certain concessions regarding the payment terms of such note. Although 1290 LLC was unable to locate any records evidencing an agreement to such concessions, Robinson Silverman has made payments reflecting such concessions and such payments were not rejected by 1290 LLC and have not been rejected by the Property Owning Partnerships. Without the Company expressing any opinion with regard thereto, if such concessions were granted, the Robinson Silverman note would have an outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 1996 of $4,976,173, would bear interest at 7.5% per annum and would require level monthly payments of interest and principal of $75,000. If such concessions were not granted, then the Robinson Silverman Note would bear interest at 10% and, based on the monthly payments of $75,000 received from Robinson Silverman, the outstanding balance as of December 31, 1996 would be approximately $6,065,644.
An affiliate of O&Y was the holder of a note (the "Warburg Pincus Note," and together with the Robinson Silverman Note, the "Tenant Notes"), issued by Warburg Pincus dated August 20, 1985, in the face amount of $4,354,758, which note was executed in connection with Warburg Pincus' lease at the 237 Property. The note is payable on October 31, 1999 and does not bear interest prior to its maturity.
On the Effective Date, such affiliates of O&Y holding the Tenant Notes assigned their interests in the Tenant Notes to the applicable Property Owning Partnership.
JMB Notes
Certain notes (the "JMB Notes") were issued by JMB LP's predecessor in interest to an affiliate of O&Y in 1984 in connection with the admission of such predecessor as a partner of the predecessor of the Debtors and an affiliate of the Debtors which owned the property located at 2 Broadway, New York, New York (the "2 Broadway Property"). The amount outstanding on an aggregate basis under all the JMB Notes, as of the Effective Date, was $83,918,815. On the Effective Date, the JMB Notes and related security agreements were assigned by such O&Y affiliate to the Company. Immediately prior to such assignment, the Company entered into a Participation Agreement with an affiliate of JMB LP pursuant to which the Company or its designee will receive the first $750,000 of payments made pursuant to, or in respect of, the JMB Notes and the JMB LP affiliate will receive all further payments in respect of the JMB Notes. Amounts, if any, distributable to JMB LP from the Upper Tier Limited Partnership, including pursuant to the Company's purchase option and JMB LP's put option as provided for in the Upper Tier Limited Partnership Agreement, would first be applied to the prepayment of the JMB Notes. On the Effective Date, the JMB Notes were restated. The JMB Notes, as restated, bear interest at 12.75% per annum and have a maturity date of January 1, 2001. The JMB Notes are non-recourse and are payable solely out of the distributions JMB LP receives from the Upper Tier Limited Partnership.
Claims Reserve
On the Effective Date, Bankers Trust Company, as disbursing agent under the Plan, received $4,966,595 on behalf of the Company, representing the amount of cash estimated to be required to pay in full all claims (disputed or otherwise), including Priority Utility Tax Claims, discussed below, arising from the Debtors' bankruptcy cases. As of December 31, 1996, $1,459,194 is being held in the Claims Reserve (as such term is defined in the Plan) pending resolution of such claims. The cash held in the Claims Reserve will be held in trust for the benefit of holders of such claims pending determination of their entitlement thereto. The Company believes that amounts in the Claims Reserve will be sufficient to pay in full all claims arising from the Debtors' bankruptcy cases.
Payments and distributions to each holder of a disputed claim will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as soon as practicable after the date that the order or judgment of the Bankruptcy Court allowing such disputed claim to be paid, without any interest thereon, from cash held in the Claims Reserve becomes a final order.
In the event that any cash held in the Claims Reserve remains after all claims have been allowed or disallowed and distributions have been made in accordance with the Plan, such cash will be transferred to the Company.
Tax Certiorari Proceedings and Tenant Reimbursement Claims
The Debtors and their predecessors-in-interest commenced tax certiorari proceedings which remain outstanding against the City of New York, for over-assessment of property taxes for the tax years ending June 30, 1995 through June 30, 1997 with respect to the 237 Property and for the tax years ending June 30, 1991 through June 30, 1997 with respect to the 1290 Property. In addition, 2 Broadway Associates, L.P. ("2 Broadway LP") similarly commenced tax certiorari proceedings against the City of New York for over- assessment of property taxes for the tax years ending June 30, 1988 through June 30, 1995 with respect to the 2 Broadway Property. The rights to the proceeds of the 2 Broadway Property tax certiorari proceedings were assigned to the Company pursuant to the Plan. See "-- Certain Assets Related to 2 Broadway." The Property Owning Partnerships and the Company have executed stipulations which would substitute the Property Owning Partnerships and the Company for the Debtors and 2 Broadway LP, respectively, in such tax certiorari proceedings. Such stipulations have been filed with the Bankruptcy Court and the Property Owning Partnerships and the Company are awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's approval. The Company estimates Net Tax
Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) from such tax certiorari proceedings of approximately $14,000,000. Certain current and former tenants of the Properties and the 2 Broadway Property hold unsecured claims (the "Tenant Reimbursement Claims") against the Property Owning Partnerships and the Company based upon a right to payment provided in such tenant's lease, contingent upon the realization by the Property Owning Partnerships and the Company of the proceeds, if any, of any tax certiorari proceedings which were commenced by the Debtors and 2 Broadway LP with respect to the Properties, net of any amounts, fees and expenses incurred to prepare for, institute and prosecute such tax certiorari proceedings (the "Net Tax Proceeds"). The Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company receiving such Net Tax Proceeds will cause an amount necessary, in their sole determination, to reserve in full for all Tenant Reimbursement Claims to be transferred to the Disbursing Agent for deposit in the Claims Reserve. Within 30 days after the date of such deposit, the Property Owning Partnerships and the Company will determine the entitlement of holders of Tenant Reimbursement Claims to payment of such Tenant Reimbursement Claims by reason of the receipt of such Net Tax Proceeds and, in making such determination, will be entitled to give effect to any rights of setoff, recoupment or other claims that the Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company or any predecessor-in-interest may have against the holders of such Tenant Reimbursement Claims. Thereafter, the Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company will deliver a notice of such determination to each holder of a Tenant Reimbursement Claim. Each holder of a Tenant Reimbursement Claim will have 30 days after receipt of such notice to object to the determination of the amount to which it is entitled. If the holder of a Tenant Reimbursement Claim does not object to the determination by the Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company within such 30 day period, then such Tenant Reimbursement Claim will be paid from the Claims Reserve at the request of the Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company, without the necessity of Bankruptcy Court approval. If the holder of a Tenant Reimbursement Claim objects on a timely basis to the determination by the Property Owning Partnerships and/or the Company, then such Tenant Reimbursement Claim will be a disputed claim and no payments will be made on account of such claim until such claim is allowed, in whole or in part, by final order of the Bankruptcy Court. All remaining Net Tax Proceeds held by the Property Owning Partnerships will be distributed to the Lower Tier Limited Partnership which will in turn distribute such Net Tax Proceeds related to the Properties to the Company; provided, that, the Property Owning Partnerships are required to retain sufficient cash to pay all disputed Tenant Reimbursement Claims until such claims have been allowed or disallowed. The Company estimates that approximately $6,414,000 will be paid to current and former tenants in respect of Tenant Reimbursement Claims resulting in a net recovery by the Property Owning Partnerships of approximately $7,586,000.
Priority Utility Tax Claims
Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors were deemed to have objected to all claims against the Debtors arising from the nonpayment of New York State or New York City utility taxes (the "Priority Utility Tax Claims") evidenced by a filed proof of claim. As successor to the Debtors, the Upper Tier Limited Partnership has the exclusive right to prosecute any objection to Priority Utility Tax Claims, any litigation related to any objection to Priority Utility Tax Claims and to compromise or settle any such objection or litigation. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company established a claims reserve for such claims. In the event that the Upper Tier Limited Partnership settles any Priority Utility Tax Claim, the Property Owning Partnership owning the Property in question will indemnify the holders of equity interests in the Debtor which had formerly owned the Property in question (and their successors and assigns) from all claims which may be made by the City or State of New York in respect of utility taxes, interest and penalties in connection with such Property unless such settlement includes a release of such holders from all such claims. At such time as the Priority Utility Tax Claims are disallowed or allowed (as determined by either a court of competent jurisdiction or by agreement between the Company and the relevant taxing authority), the Disbursing Agent will at the direction of the Company pay any such allowed claims from cash held in such claims reserve and any amount held in the claims reserve in excess of the amount of such allowed claims will be paid to the Company. The Company believes that amounts held in such claims reserve will be sufficient to pay in full all Priority Utility Tax Claims.
Certain Assets Related to 2 Broadway
Prior to the Merger of the Debtors into the Upper Tier Limited Partnership, 1290 LLC assigned to the Company all of its rights in certain assets related to the sale of 2 Broadway that was owned by 2 Broadway LP, an affiliate of the Debtors, including the assets described below and segregated reserve accounts established by the Trustee, as disbursing agent under the reorganization plan related to the 2 Broadway Property (the "2 Broadway Plan"), (i) in the amount of $2,400,000 for potential utility tax claims of the taxing authorities of the City and State of New York (the "2 Broadway Priority Utility Tax Claims") and (ii) in the amount of $811,278, for the payment of all claims which were not then, but might become allowed claims (other than the 2 Broadway Priority Utility Tax Claims) in connection with the 2 Broadway Plan. As of the Effective Date, the $811,278 reserve was reduced to $346,139 as a result of the payment of certain claims. Pursuant to an Assumption and Indemnification Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, by and among 1290 LLC, 2 Broadway LP, the Company and the Indenture Trustee, (i) the Company assumed any and all remaining obligations of 1290 LLC and 2 Broadway LP in connection with any claims reserved pursuant to section 9.3 of the 2 Broadway Plan, and (ii) the Company received the remaining $346,139 of the claims reserve. The balance in the 2 Broadway Utility Tax Claims reserve account as of December 31, 1996 was $2,553,515. The Company believes that amounts held in the 2 Broadway claims reserve will be sufficient to pay in full all claims arising under the 2 Broadway Plan.
The assets related to the 2 Broadway Property that were assigned to the Company include the following:
(a) the right to receive any surplus amounts in the claims reserve and the utility tax reserve under the 2 Broadway Plan;
(b) the right to proceeds of certain tax certiorari proceedings existing with respect to 2 Broadway (net of costs of collections and payments to be made to tenants);
(c) the right to receive any remaining post-closing apportionments under the contract of sale pursuant to which the 2 Broadway Property was sold; and
(d) the right to receive dividends and distributions under certain non-transferable stock received by 2 Broadway LP in connection with the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert, a former tenant of the 2 Broadway Property.
The Company has executed stipulations which would substitute the Company for 2 Broadway LP in the tax certiorari proceedings described in (b) above. Such stipulations have been filed with the Bankruptcy Court and the Company is awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's approval. The Company received the remaining post-closing apportionments described in (c) above, totaling approximately $86,000, in 1997.
Indebtedness
On the Effective Date, The Chase Manhattan Bank ("Chase") and certain other lenders made a loan to the Property Owning Partnerships in the aggregate principal amount of $420,000,000. The net proceeds (after fees, expenses and escrows) of the Chase financing (approximately $398,741,189) were used to make distributions pursuant to the Plan. The Company intends to cause the Property Owning Partnerships to pay debt service on this indebtedness out of the Property Owning Partnerships' revenues from their operation of the Properties. The Company and the Property Owning Partnerships do not intend to incur any additional indebtedness, other than trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that the cash flow generated by the Properties will be sufficient to meet the debt service requirements of the loan and that it has sufficient cash to fund its working capital needs for the next twelve months.
ITEM 3.
