MAJOR OFFICE AND RETAIL PROPERTIES
General. This section describes the major operating properties in which the Company has an interest either directly or indirectly through joint venture arrangements. A "negative investment" in a joint venture results from distributions of capital to the Company, if any, exceeding the sum of (i) the Company's contributions of capital and (ii) reported earnings (losses) of the joint venture allocated to the Company. "Investment" in a joint venture means the book value of the Company's investment in the joint venture.
Wildwood Office Park. Wildwood Office Park, a Class A commercial development in suburban Atlanta, was master planned by I.M. Pei. Located in Atlanta's northwest commercial district, just north of the Interstate 285/Interstate 75 intersection, the property features convenient access to all of Atlanta's major office, commercial and residential districts. The Wildwood complex overlooks the Chattahoochee River and borders 1,200 acres of national forest, thus providing an urban office facility in a forest setting. Developments in Wildwood Office Park include the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building (681,000 rentable square feet), the 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (634,000 rentable square feet) and the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (313,000 rentable square feet). At December 31, 1993, these three buildings were 93%, 95% and 83% leased, respectively. IBM has been a major tenant in these three buildings, leasing approximately 813,000 square feet, or approximately 50% of the rentable square feet. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Additional Prospective Information." Wildwood Office Park also contains 13 acres leased to two banking facilities and four restaurants (one of which is currently under construction); an additional one acre retail site currently being marketed to prospective users, and a child care facility.
The 3200 Windy Hill Road Building was financed primarily with equity, and at December 31, 1993 had $9.7 million outstanding debt related to it. The 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building and the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building were financed primarily with debt and, at December 31, 1993, had $82 million and $31.5 million of outstanding debt related to them, respectively.
The developments described above are located on land controlled by Wildwood Associates, a joint venture between the Company and IBM formed in 1985. The Company and IBM each have a 50% interest in Wildwood Associates. Wildwood Associates also controls approximately 53 acres in Wildwood Office Park held for future development, which is composed of a 6 acre site with a restaurant and approximately 58,000 square feet of office space which was purchased in 1986 for future development, and 47 acres of other land to be developed (see "Land Held for Investment - Wildwood Office Park").
At December 31, 1993, the Company's investment in Wildwood Associates and a related partnership (see "Summit Green") was approximately $4,867,000, which included the cost of the land the Company is committed to contribute to Wildwood Associates. In addition, the Company has severally guaranteed one-half of a $50,000,000 bank line of credit to Wildwood Associates related to the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building, under which, as noted above, $9.7 million was drawn at December 31, 1993.
Wildwood Office Park also contains the 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building, a 106,000 rentable square foot office building located on approximately 5 acres which is wholly owned by the Company. Commencing January 1994, a single tenant leased approximately 60% of this building. The lease has options permitting the tenant to expand its occupancy to the remainder of the building over the next several years. In addition, the 3100 Windy Hill Road Building, a 188,000 rentable
square foot corporate training facility occupies a 13-acre parcel of land which is wholly owned by the Company. The training facility improvements were sold in 1983 to a limited partnership of private investors, at which time the Company received a leasehold mortgage note. The training facility land was simultaneously leased to the partnership for thirty years, along with certain equipment for varying periods. The training facility was 100% leased by the partnership to IBM through November 1993. In January 1993, the IBM lease was extended through November 30, 1998. Concurrently with the IBM extension, the mortgage note and related leases were also modified (see Note 3 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").
NationsBank Plaza. NationsBank Plaza is a Class A, 55-story, 1.3 million rentable square foot office tower designed by Kevin Roche and is located on approximately 3.7 acres of land between the midtown and downtown districts of Atlanta, Georgia. The building, which was completed in 1992, was approximately 80% leased at December 31, 1993. An affiliate of NationsBank, the fourth largest bank in the United States, leases 46% of the rentable square feet.
NationsBank Plaza was developed by CSC Associates, L.P. ("CSC"), a joint venture formed by the Company and C&S Premises, Inc., an affiliate of NationsBank. The Company and C&S Premises, Inc. each have a 50% interest in CSC.
In October 1993, the partnership fully repaid all of its debt with equity contributions of $86.7 million made by each partner. At December 31, 1993, the Company's investment in CSC was approximately $106,759,000. The Company has guaranteed one-half of a $20,000,000 bank line of credit under which there was no outstanding balance at December 31, 1993.
CSC's net income or loss and cash distributions are allocated to the partners based on their percentage interests (50% each), subject to a preference to Cousins. The Cousins preference is $2.5 million (giving Cousins an additional $1.25 million over what it would otherwise receive), and accrues to Cousins, with interest at 9% to the extent unpaid, over the period February 1, 1992 through January 31, 1995. Following repayment of the partnership's debt in October 1993, Cousins began recognizing its accrued preference currently in income, which resulted in Cousins recognizing $874,000 in income over what it would have otherwise recognized in the year ended December 31, 1993. The partners have agreed that until cumulative retained earnings (before considering distributions) exceed zero, which should occur in 1994, distributions will be based on their percentage interests. Thereafter, Cousins will be distributed its preference, to the extent earned, with amounts above the preference amount distributed based on the partners' percentage interests.
First Union Tower. First Union Tower is a Class A office building containing approximately 317,000 rentable square feet. The property is located on approximately one acre of land in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. First Union Tower opened in the first quarter of 1990 and at December 31, 1993 was approximately 81% leased.
First Union Tower is owned by North Greene Associates Limited Partnership ("North Greene Associates"), which was formed in 1987 as a joint venture of the Company and Weaver Downtown Limited Partnership. The Company has an 85% ownership interest in North Greene Associates, and accounts for it as a consolidated entity. At December 31, 1993, the Company had a demand loan outstanding to the partnership of $28,051,000. The Company's demand loan to the partnership was used to pay down to $3,500,000 the outstanding balance of a first mortgage bank line of credit on this property. The Company has guaranteed 27.3% of the bank line of credit.
One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower is a 50-story, Class A office tower located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia that was completed in December 1990. One
Ninety One Peachtree Tower, which contains 1.2 million rentable square feet, was designed by John Burgee Architects, with Phillip Johnson as design consultant.
One Ninety One Peachtree Tower was developed on approximately 2 acres of land, of which approximately 1.5 acres is owned and approximately one-half acre under the parking facility is leased for a 99-year term expiring in 2088 with a 99-year renewal option. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower was approximately 90% leased at December 31, 1993.
C-H Associates, Ltd. ("C-H Associates"), a partnership formed in 1988 between CREC (49%), Hines Peachtree Associates Limited Partnership (49%) and Peachtree Palace Hotel, Ltd. (2%), owns a 20% interest in the partnership that owns One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. C-H Associates' 20% ownership of One Ninety One Peachtree Tower results in an effective 9.8% ownership interest by CREC in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. The balance of the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project is owned by DIHC Peachtree Associates, an affiliate of DIHC.
Through C-H Associates, CREC received 50% of the development fees from the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. In addition, CREC owns a 50% interest in two general partnerships which receive fees from leasing and managing the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project.
The One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was funded substantially by debtuntil March 1993, at which time DIHC Peachtree Associates contributed equity in the amount of $145,000,000. Subsequent to the equity contribution, C-H Associates is entitled to a priority distribution of $250,000 per year (of which the Company is entitled to receive $112,500) for seven years beginning in 1993. The equity contributed by DIHC Peachtree Associates is entitled to a preferred return at a rate increasing over the first 14 years from 5.5% to 11.5% (payable after the Company's priority return). Thereafter, the partners will share in any distributions in accordance with their percentage interests. At December 31, 1993, the Company had a negative investment of $90,000 in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project.
Ten Peachtree Place. Ten Peachtree Place is a 20-story, 259,000 rentable square foot Class A office building located in midtown Atlanta, Georgia. Completed in 1991, this structure was designed by Michael Graves and is currently 100% leased to Coca-Cola. Approximately four acres of adjacent land, currently used for surface parking, are available for future development.
Ten Peachtree Place is owned by Ten Peachtree Place Associates, a general partnership between the Company (50%) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola (50%).
Ten Peachtree Place Associates acquired the property in 1991 for a nominal cash investment, subject to a ten-year purchase money note. This 8% purchase money note had an outstanding balance of $22.3 million at December 31, 1993. If the purchase money note is paid in accordance with its terms, it will amortize to approximately $15.3 million ($59 per rentable square foot) over the ten-year term of the Coca-Cola lease, at which time Coca-Cola is entitled to receive the preferred return described below and the property may be sold, re-leased, or returned to the lender under the purchase money note for $1.00 without penalty or any further liability to the Company for the indebtedness. At December 31, 1993, the Company had a negative investment in Ten Peachtree Place Associates of $66,000.
The Company anticipates that Ten Peachtree Place Associates will generate approximately $400,000 per year of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization during the ten-year lease. The partnership agreement generally provides that each of the partners is entitled
to receive 50% of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization (excluding any sale proceeds) for ten years, after which time the Company is entitled to 15% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds) and its partner is entitled to receive 85% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds), until the two partners have received a combined distribution of $15.3 million, after which time each partner is entitled to receive 50% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds).
Summit Green. Summit Green, a 21-acre office park located in Greensboro, North Carolina, is owned by Wildwood Associates (the partnership with IBM) and a related partnership. The park contains a 135,000 rentable square foot mid-rise office building which was 100% leased at March 15, 1994. The Summit Green land is leased from an unrelated third party for a 99-year term expiring in 2084. Space exists for two additional office buildings, but the Company has no plans to commence additional development without prior leasing commitments.

The balance of the mall, approximately 672,000 square feet, is owned by four major department stores (Sears, Roebuck & Co., J.C. Penney, Rich's and Belk). The portion of Haywood Mall owned by Haywood Mall Associates was developed on approximately 19 acres of land, of which approximately 16 acres is owned and approximately 3 acres (of parking area) is leased under a ground lease expiring in 2067. The portion of Haywood Mall owned by the joint venture was approximately 98% leased to approximately 107 tenants as of December 31, 1993 and has been at least 90% leased since 1986.
The Company has a 50% interest in Haywood Mall Associates. The Company originally had only a nominal cash investment, but funded an aggregate of $2.8 million in 1988 through 1990 as its 50% share of capital improvements made to the mall, including a new food court area. At December 31, 1993 the Company's investment was $323,000.
Haywood Mall Associates has announced an expansion of the mall to be completed by mid-1995. The expansion will include the addition of approximately 70,000 square feet of new mall shops owned by the venture, a Dillard's department store, and an expansion of the Belk-Simpson department store. The venture intends to fund the expansion, as well as the prepayment of an existing 9.37% first mortgage in May 1994, with equity contributions of approximately $22 million from each venturer.
Perimeter Expo Associates, L.P. In June 1993, Perimeter Expo Associates, L.P. (90% owned by Cousins and 10% owned by CNM) purchased the land for and began construction of this retail power center adjacent to Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.

(owned 82.3% by Cousins and
17.7% by an affiliate of Coca-Cola). Additionally, Cousins contributed certain acres of its wholly owned Georgia Highway 400 land to the new venture. The venture is constructing North Point Market, a retail power center adjacent to North Point Mall, which will have 314,000 square feet in Phase I. The center also includes six outparcels that are being ground leased to freestanding users. Phase I will open in the spring of 1994.
Presidential Market. In October 1993, construction commenced on Presidential Market, an approximately 310,000 square foot retail power center, located in northeast suburban Atlanta. The Company will own approximately 194,000 square feet of the center (depending upon how much of the unleased space is actually constructed), with the remaining 116,000 square feet being separately developed as a Target which is owned by Dayton Hudson Corporation. The center is scheduled to open in the fall of 1994.
Georgia Highway 400 Stand Alone Retail Sites. In September 1993, the Company transferred to Operating Properties the carrying value of 32 acres of the land the Company owns at the intersection of Georgia Highway 400 and Haynes Bridge Road in suburban Atlanta, Georgia surrounding North Point Mall. This land is being ground leased in 1 to 2 acre sites to freestanding users. The remaining 308 developable acres is discussed below in Land Held for Investment and Future Development.
LAND HELD FOR INVESTMENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
The following describes significant land holdings owned directly by the Company or indirectly through joint venture arrangements. The Company intends to convert its land holdings to income-producing usage or to sell portions of land holdings as opportunities present themselves over time.

This joint venture constructed North Point Mall, a 1.3 million square foot regional mall which opened in October 1993. The Company believes the construction of North Point Mall has significantly enhanced the value of its Georgia Highway 400 land.
Of the Company's land, approximately 92 acres of the land located on the east side of Georgia Highway 400 are zoned for mixed-use development including retail and office space. Approximately 230 acres of the land are located on the west side of Georgia Highway 400 and are zoned for office, institutional and light industrial use.

Temco Associates has an option through March 2006, with no carrying costs, to acquire approximately 35,000 acres in Paulding County, Georgia (northwest of Atlanta, Georgia), of which approximately 13,000 acres would be a fee simple interest and approximately 22,000 acres would be a timber rights interest only. The option may be exercised in whole or in part over the option period. The Temco Associates property has the potential for future residential and industrial development. Temco Associates has also engaged in certain sales of land as to which it simultaneously exercised its purchase option. During 1993, approximately 1,100 acres of the option related to the fee simple interest was exercised and simultaneously sold for gross profits of $305,000.
OTHER REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS
Omni Norfolk Hotel. Norfolk Hotel Associates ("NHA") is a general partnership formed in 1978 between the Company and an affiliate of Odyssey Partners, L.P. (an investment partnership), each as 50% partners, which held a mortgage note on and owned the land under the 442-room Omni International Hotel in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. In January 1992, NHA terminated the land lease and became the owner of the hotel and a long-term parking agreement with an adjacent building owner. The partnership is currently receiving cash payments of approximately $400,000 per
year (subject to annual increases) under the parking agreement. In April 1993, the partnership sold the hotel, but retained its interest in the parking agreement. The Company's share of the gain on this transaction was approximately $.5 million and is included in Income From Joint Ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The partnership received a mortgage note for a portion of the sales proceeds.
At December 31, 1993, the Company had an investment of $830,000 in NHA. The Company has also guaranteed a $4.85 million line of credit to NHA under which $1,000 had been drawn at December 31, 1993, and its partner has guaranteed an equal line of credit under which $4.625 million had been drawn at December 31, 1993. Additionally, NHA has a $4.75 million line of credit, payable upon demand to the Company under which $4.624 million had been drawn at December 31, 1993. The line bears interest at the daily Federal funds rate plus 75 basis points with payments of interest only until the maturity date of November 1, 1994. This line of credit is being used by the Company for temporary investment of excess cash. NHA used the cash to temporarily pay down the bank line of credit which the Company guarantees.
