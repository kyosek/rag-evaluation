ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We own a controlling interest in 75 Malls (including large open-air centers) and non-controlling interests in nine Malls. We also own a controlling interest in two Mall expansions that are currently under construction. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas.
The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores (20,000 square feet or less) lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls’ parking areas.
We classify our regional malls into two categories - malls that have completed their initial lease-up are referred to as stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease-up phase and have not been open for three calendar years are referred to as non-stabilized malls. Alamance Crossing in Burlington, NC, which opened in August 2007, is our only non-stabilized mall as of December 31, 2008.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Walnut Square, Westgate Mall, St. Clair Square, Brookfield Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, Wausau Center, Chapel Hill Mall, Eastgate Mall and Eastland Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases. We lease all or a portion of the land at Monroeville Mall subject to a short-term ground lease.

Anchors
Anchors are an important factor in a Mall’s successful performance. The public’s identification with a mall property typically focuses on the anchor tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.
Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to mall store tenants. Anchors account for 10.5% of the total revenues from our Properties. Each anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2008, we added the following anchors and junior anchor boxes (i.e., non-traditional anchors) to the following Malls:

Community Centers

Community Centers typically have less development risk because of shorter development periods and lower costs.

Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.
