Item 2. Properties
The Fund has acquired a Limited Partnership interest in 181 Operating Partnerships in ten series, identified in the table set forth below. The Apartment Complex owned by the Operating Partnership is eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit. Occupancy of a unit in each Apartment Complex which initially complied with the Minimum Set-Aside Test (i.e., occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the Rent Restriction Test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to hereinafter as "Qualified Occupancy." The Operating Partnership and the respective Apartment Complex is described more fully in the Prospectus. The General Partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the property.
Please refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.
