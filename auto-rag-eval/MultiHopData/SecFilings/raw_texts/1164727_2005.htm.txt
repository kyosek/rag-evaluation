ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)
Gold and Copper Processing Methods
Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore and the amenability of the ore to treatment. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes through a cyanide leaching circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the top surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation directly from leach solutions.
Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidization, generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidization, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore with air and oxygen to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide minerals in the ore.
Some gold-bearing sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the
slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to float in air bubbles to the top of the tank, where they can be separated from waste particles that sink to the bottom. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.
At Batu Hijau, mined ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator. The ore is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate of copper sulfides containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate is transferred by pipeline to port facilities. At the port, the concentrate is dewatered and stored for later reclaiming and loading onto ships for transport to smelters.
Newmont Properties
Production Properties
Set forth below is a description of Newmont’s significant production properties. Costs applicable to sales for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
Nevada
Newmont has been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Twin Creeks mine approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, the Lone Tree Complex near the town of Valmy, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. Newmont also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with Barrick, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks. The Phoenix gold/copper project, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, is under construction with production expected by April 2006. The Leeville underground project, located on the Carlin Trend northwest of the Carlin East underground mine, is under construction, with completion scheduled for late 2006.
Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.4 million ounces for 2005 with ore mined from 13 open pit mines and four underground mines. At year-end 2005, Newmont reported 33.3 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 83% at open pit mines and 17% in underground mines. Process methods assumed over the reserve base are 76% refractory and 24% oxide. Refractory ores require more complex, higher cost processing methods. Refractory ore treatment facilities generated 69% of Nevada’s gold production in 2005, compared with 68% in 2004, and 72% in 2003.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To schedule the best use of processing capacity, the Company uses a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5), Twin Creeks (Juniper) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Lone Tree and Phoenix. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade refractory ores are processed by a flotation plant at Lone Tree and either bio-oxidation/flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site. Mining and the final placement of ore on the leach pads at Lone Tree is scheduled to end in third quarter of 2006. Residual leaching will continue thereafter. Milling of stockpiled ore at Lone Tree is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007.
Newmont owns, or controls through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, Newmont owns a 10% undivided interest in the mineral rights and leases the remaining 90%, on which Newmont pays a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. The remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights are wholly-owned or controlled by Newmont, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in the Winnemucca Region, Newmont is obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 2% to 5% of production.
Newmont has a 25% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick to operate the Turquoise Ridge and Getchell mines. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture for mining and ore delivery to process. Gold sales of 52,300 ounces were attributed to Newmont in 2005, based on its 25% ownership interest.
Newmont has an ore sale agreement with Barrick Goldstrike Mines to provide feed to some of Barrick’s facilities on the Carlin Trend. Newmont recognized attributed gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 104,600 ounces in 2005.
Yanacocha, Peru
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land position. Yanacocha’s mining rights were acquired through assignments of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable.
The Yanacocha operations contain the Conga deposit, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2004. Yanacocha added 3.1 million ounces of gold (1.6 million equity ounces) and 1 billion pounds of copper (0.5 billion equity pounds) to proven and probable reserves at Conga in 2005.
Yanacocha currently has five open pit mines, Carachugo, San José, Maqui Maqui, Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua. Reclamation and/or backfilling activities in the mining areas of Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua are still active pits. In addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads and three processing facilities. Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2005 totaled 3.3 million ounces (1.7 million equity ounces).
Australia/New Zealand
In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land, such rights commonly referred to as native title. Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
Newmont does not expect that native title claims will have a material adverse effect on any of its operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues.
Pajingo. Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. In 2005, Pajingo sold 192,000 ounces of gold.
Jundee (Yandal). The Yandal operations (100% owned) are situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. In 2003, the operations included Wiluna, Bronzewing and Jundee. Operations at Bronzewing ceased during the second quarter of 2004 and the operations were sold the third quarter of 2004. The Wiluna operation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Jundee mine is the remaining Yandal operation and sold 341,800 ounces of gold in 2005.
Tanami. Tanami operations include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites. The Tanami operations also included the Groundrush deposit. Mining at the Groundrush open pit was completed in September 2004. Processing of stockpiles continued into the third quarter of 2005. The Tanami operations have been wholly-owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests.
The operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak, with mill feed supplemented by production stockpiles from the Dead Bullock Soak open pit and Windy Hill at The Granites. Ore from all of these operations is processed through The Granites plant with the exception of ore from Groundrush, which was processed through the Tanami plant. During 2005, the Tanami operations sold 493,700 ounces of gold.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest. The Super Pit is Australia’s largest gold mine in terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2005, the Kalgoorlie operations sold 409,600 equity ounces of gold.
Martha. The Martha open pit mine is located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. Newmont acquired the minority interests in the Martha mine in April 2003. During 2005, development continued on the Favona underground deposit. Production from the Favona deposit is scheduled for 2007. The operation sold 163,400 ounces of gold during 2005. The Martha mine does not currently pay royalties. Under new royalty arrangements, however, Newmont will pay 1% of gross revenues from gold and silver sales, or 5% of accounting profit, whichever is greater, at Favona.
Boddington. Boddington is a development project located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. At December 31, 2005 Boddington was owned by Newmont (44.4%), AngloGold Ashanti Limited (33.3%) and Newcrest Mining Limited (22.2%). In February 2006, Newmont entered into an agreement to acquire Newcrest’s 22.22% interest in Boddington for A$225 plus applicable stamp duty and similar costs. When the transaction closes, Newmont’s interest in Boddington will increase to two-thirds. Closing of the transaction is subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board, Western Australia Government and other approvals, and is expected by April 2006. In February 2006, Newmont’s Board of Directors approved the development of the Boddington project.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia
Newmont operates Batu Hijau, a producer of copper/gold concentrates, and has a 45% ownership interest therein, held through a partnership with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation. Newmont has a 56.25% interest in the partnership and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. The partnership, in turn, owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is a carried interest held by P.T. Pukuafu Indah, an unrelated Indonesian company. Through September 30, 2004, PTNNT recorded cumulative losses and therefore Newmont historically reported a 56.25% economic interest in Batu Hijau. As a result of higher metal prices, improved operating and financial results, and increased life of mine expectations regarding production, costs and economics, PTNNT’s cumulative losses had been recovered by the fourth quarter of 2004, thereby allowing for the payment of dividends. Under existing shareholder agreements, the Indonesian shareholder will be entitled to receive 6% of any dividends paid by PTNNT until such time as a loan to the Indonesian shareholder is fully repaid (including accrued interest). Newmont, therefore, decreased its economic interest in Batu Hijau to 52.875%, effective October 1, 2004, reflecting 56.25% of the 94% of PTNNT’s dividends payable to the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership.
Prior to January 1, 2004, we accounted for our investment in Batu Hijau as an equity investment due to each of PTNNT shareholders’ significant participating rights in Batu Hijau’s business. Newmont identified Batu Hijau as a variable interest entity because of certain capital structures and contractual relationships, and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of Batu Hijau. Therefore, pursuant to FIN 46R, Newmont consolidated Batu Hijau effective January 1, 2004. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2005, copper sales were 572.7 million pounds (302.8 million equity pounds), while gold sales were 720,500 ounces (381,000 equity ounces).
In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 15% by the end of the 2005; 23% by the end of 2006; 30% by the end of 2007; 37% by the end of 2008, 44% by the end of 2009; and 51% by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern.
An Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, which requires the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership to offer a 3% interest in 2006. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010.
Other Operations
Canada. Newmont’s Canadian operations include two underground mines. The Golden Giant mine (100% owned) is located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon in Ontario, Canada, and has been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with final mill production and gold sales expected in the first quarter of 2006. In 2005, the Golden Giant mine sold 162,000 ounces of gold. The Holloway mine is located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson in Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant, and has been in production since 1996. The Holloway mine is 100% owned as of October 2005. At December 31, 2005 the Company classified the Holloway mine as an asset held for sale. Operating results for Holloway have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Mexico. Newmont has a 44% interest in the La Herradura mine, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Industriales Peñoles and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura sold 80,200 equity ounces of gold in 2005.
Bolivia. The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont has an 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado.
Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. The mill was closed in October 2003 and production continued from residual leaching. In 2005, additional material from the stockpiles and Lla Llagua pit were placed on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit was processed on a new leach pad. In 2005, the mine sold 83,200 equity ounces of gold.
Minahasa, Indonesia. Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Minahasa.
Uzbekistan. Newmont has a 50% interest in the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture in Uzbekistan. Ownership of the remaining 50% interest is divided between the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine, each a state entity of Uzbekistan. The joint venture produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide material from the nearby government-owned Muruntau mine, located in the Kyzylkum Desert. The gold produced by Zarafshan-Newmont is sold in international markets for U.S. dollars. Zarafshan-Newmont sold 122,700 equity ounces of gold in 2005.
The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan-Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 242.5 million tons of ore to Zarafshan-Newmont from various areas of the stockpiles designated into four different “Zones” under the agreement. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 156 million tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 87 million tons to be delivered from Zone 4 at an average ore grade of 0.036 per ton. In February 2006, Newmont, the State Committee and Navoi reached an agreement to amend the ore supply agreement. This amendment will reduce the average ore grade to be provided from 0.036 ounce per ton to 0.032 ounce per ton.
Ghana, Development Projects
Newmont has two projects under construction in Ghana, in West Africa. The Ahafo project, located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, is 100% owned by Newmont following the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Ntotoroso property from Moydow Mines International, Inc. in December 2003. Development activities during 2005 included engineering, procurement and construction of the mine and process facilities. Initial development costs at Ahafo are estimated at approximately $475, with estimated average steady-state annual gold sales of approximately 500,000 to 550,000 ounces starting in mid-2006. At December 31, 2005, the Ahafo project had reserves of 12.2 million ounces of gold.
At December 31, 2005, Newmont held an 85% interest in the Akyem project, located in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The remaining 15% was held by Kenbert Mines Limited. In July 2005, Newmont’s Board of Directors approved the development of the Akyem project. Initial development costs are estimated at approximately $500, with gold production expected to commence in the second half of 2008. The Akyem project is anticipated to generate steady-state annual gold sales of approximately 500,000 ounces. At year-end 2005, the Akyem project had 6.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves. In January 2006, Newmont acquired Kenbert’s interest in the Akyem project.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, Newmont will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 28%) not to exceed 32.5% and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after Newmont has recouped its investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection.
Operating Statistics

The following table details operating statistics related to copper production and sales.
(1) Newmont’s economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004.
(2) Batu Hijau was accounted for by the equity method in 2003. Had Batu Hijau been consolidated in 2003 copper pounds sold would have been 610.5 million pounds (343.4 million equity pounds), Costs applicable to sales would have been $0.31 per pound and Total production cost per pound would have been $0.44 per pound.
Royalty Properties
The following is a description of Newmont’s principal royalty interests, all of which were acquired as a result of the Franco-Nevada acquisition. Newmont’s royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty, which provides for the payment, either in cash or physical metal (“in kind”) of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, Newmont owns a net profit interest (“NPI”) pursuant to which Newmont is entitled to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case, from a particular mining operation. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in kind (generally in the form of gold bullion) at Newmont’s option. Newmont also has a significant oil and gas royalty portfolio in Western Canada. In 2005, Newmont’s Royalty and dividend income, net was $79.
Nevada-Goldstrike. Newmont holds various NSR and NPI royalties at the Goldstrike properties (Betze-Post and Meikle mines) located on the Carlin Trend in northern Nevada. The Betze-Post and Meikle mines are owned and operated by a subsidiary of Barrick. Newmont received $22 in royalty income from the Goldstrike properties in 2005.
The Betze-Post mine is a conventional open pit operation. The Betze-Post property consists of various claim blocks and Newmont’s royalty interest in each claim block is different, ranging from 0% to 4% for the NSRs and 0% to 6% for the NPIs. The Meikle mine is an underground operation comprising the Meikle, Rodeo and Griffin deposits, located one mile north of the Betze-Post mine, with which it shares the Goldstrike processing facilities. Newmont holds a 4% NSR and a 5% NPI over 1,280 acres of the claims that cover most of the Meikle, Rodeo and Griffin deposits. Newmont is not obligated to fund any portion of the cost associated with the Betze-Post or the Meikle mines.
Montana-Stillwater. Newmont holds a 5% NSR royalty on a portion of the Stillwater mine and all of the East Boulder mine, both located near Nye, Montana and owned and operated by Stillwater Mining Company. Newmont received $9 in royalty income from the Stillwater properties in 2005. Stillwater produces palladium, platinum, and associated metals (platinum group metals or PGMs) from a geological formation known as the J-M Reef. Stillwater is the only significant producer of PGMs outside of South Africa and Russia. The J-M Reef is an extensive mineralized zone containing PGMs, which has been traced over a strike length of approximately 28 miles. To date, the majority of production has been from the Stillwater mine, with East Boulder commencing production during 2001. For the year 2005, an average of approximately 80% of the total production from the Stillwater mine and 100% of the total production from the East Boulder mine was subject to Newmont’s royalty. Because Newmont’s royalty does not apply to a portion of the Stillwater properties the percentage of future production from the royalty lands will vary from year to year.
Canada-Oil and Gas Interests. Newmont’s oil and gas royalty portfolio covers 1.8 million gross acres of producing and non-producing lands located in western Canada and the Canadian Arctic. The average royalty on these lands is 6%. Newmont received $29 in royalty income from these properties in 2005.
Investment Interests
Newmont owns a portfolio of marketable equity securities, the major components of which are Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Shore Gold Corporation, Gabriel Resources, Ltd. and Miramar Mining Corporation. The market value of the portfolio was $940 as of December 31, 2005.
Proven and Probable Reserves
Newmont had proven and probable gold reserves of 93.2 million equity ounces as of December 31, 2005.
Gold reserves for 2005 were calculated at a gold price of $400, A$550 or NZ$650 per ounce, except at Kalgoorlie, where gold reserves were calculated at a gold price of A$560 per ounce. 2005 gold reserves would decline by approximately 8%, or 7 million ounces, if calculated at a gold price of $375 per ounce. An increase in the gold price to $425 per ounce would increase gold reserves by approximately 6%, or 6 million ounces, all other assumptions remaining constant.
At year-end 2005, Nevada proven and probable gold reserves were 33.3 million equity ounces. Outside of Nevada, year-end gold reserves were 59.9 million equity ounces, including 14.9 million equity ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 16.8 million equity ounces in Peru and 18.7 million equity ounces in Ghana. Copper reserves at year-end 2005 were 9.1 billion equity pounds. Copper reserves were calculated at a copper price of $1.00 or A$1.43 per pound.
Under current mining plans, all reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which economic feasibility has been determined. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the several different processing methods to be used. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, metallurgical recoveries and operating costs.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper in proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience. Market price fluctuations of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
Reserves are published once each year and will be recalculated as of December 31, 2006, taking into account metal prices, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions to reserves during 2006.
The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves(1) reflecting only those reserves owned by Newmont on December 31, 2005 and 2004:
(1) The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material that can economically be included in the reserves in a given deposit. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, amenability of the ore to gold extraction, and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2005 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $400, A$550 or NZ$650 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2004 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $350, A$550 or NZ$650 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
(2) Tonnages include allowances for losses resulting from mining methods. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
(3) Ounces or pounds are estimates of metal contained in ore tonnages and do not include allowances for processing losses. Metallurgical recovery rates represent the estimated amount of metal to be recovered through metallurgical extraction processes. Ounces are rounded to the nearest 10,000.
(4) Cut-off grades utilized in Nevada 2005 reserves were as follows: oxide leach material not less than 0.006 ounce per ton; oxide mill material not less than 0.060 ounce per ton; refractory leach material not less than 0.031 ounce per ton; and refractory mill material not less than 0.038 ounce per ton.
(5) Includes undeveloped reserves at Castle Reef, North Lantern and Emigrant deposits for combined total undeveloped reserves of 1.75 million ounces.
(6) The Lone Tree deposit will be mined out in August 2006 based on the current mine plan. Processing of stockpiles and residual leaching will continue after the open pit operation is closed.
(7) Deposit is partially developed. Construction of facilities began in November 2004, and production is expected in mid-2006.
(8) Includes partially developed reserves at Leeville, which contains total reserves of 2.4 million ounces. Production is expected in 2006.
(9) Also contains reserves of 11 million ounces of silver with a metallurgical recovery of 90%.
(10) Reserves estimate provided by Placer Dome, the operator of the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture.
(11) Stockpiles are comprised primarily of material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. Stockpile reserves are reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000.
(12) In-process material is material on leach pads at the end of each year from which gold remains to be recovered. In-process material reserves are reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000.
(13) Reserves include currently undeveloped deposits at Corimayo and Chaquicocha Sur, which contain combined undeveloped reserves of 3 million equity ounces. Cut-off grades utilized in 2005 reserves were as follows: oxide leach material not less than 0.004 ounce per ton; and oxide mill material not less than 0.038 ounce per ton.
(14) Deposits are currently undeveloped. Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.009 ounce per ton.
(15) Deposit is currently undeveloped. Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.010 ounce per ton. Newmont announced the acquisition of an additional 22.22% equity interest on February 12, 2006, which upon closing will increase Newmont’s equity ownership to 66.67%.
(16) Reserves based on a gold price of A$560 per ounce. Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.026 ounce per ton.
(17) Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.035 ounce per ton.

(24) Newmont’s equity interest increased to 100% in 2005 from 93.87% in 2004 because our joint venture partner elected not to participate in the work program; as a result, its equity interest converted into a net profits interest. Property includes partially developed reserves of 15,000 ounces at the Blacktop deposit. Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.16 ounce per ton.
(25) Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.008 ounce per ton.
(26) Cut-off grade utilized in 2005 reserves not less than 0.009 ounce per ton.
(27) Reserves are comprised primarily of stockpile material contractually designated for processing by Zarafshan-Newmont. Tonnage and gold content of material available to Zarafshan-Newmont for processing from the designated stockpiles are guaranteed by the state entities of Uzbekistan. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, and pursuant to an agreement with the state entities, the state entities re-designated the stockpile material available to Zarafshan-Newmont, which will reduce 2006 reserves by approximately 190,000 ounces.
(28) Reserves were calculated at a gold price of A$425 per ounce.
