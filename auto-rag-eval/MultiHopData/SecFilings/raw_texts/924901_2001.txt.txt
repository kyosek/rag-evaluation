Item 2: Properties. The Properties are located in 10 states, primarily in the Northeast, and the District of Columbia.
The Company's strategy has been to focus its operations, acquisition and development of office properties in markets and sub-markets where it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. The Company will continue this strategy by expanding, through acquisitions and/or development in Northeast markets and sub-markets where it has, or can achieve, similar status. The Company believes that its Properties have excellent locations and access and are well-maintained and professionally managed. As a result, the Company believes that its Properties attract high quality tenants and achieve among the highest rental, occupancy and tenant retention rates within their markets. The Company also believes that its extensive market knowledge provides it with a significant competitive advantage which is further enhanced by its strong reputation for, and emphasis on, delivering highly responsive, professional management services. See "Business Strategies".
As of December 31, 2001, executive officers and directors of the Company and their affiliates owned approximately 11.0 percent of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock (including Units redeemable or convertible into shares of Common Stock). As used herein, the term "Units" refers to limited partnership interests in Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Operating Partnership"), through which the Company conducts its real estate activities. The Company's executive officers have been employed by the Company and/or its predecessor companies for an average of approximately 14 years.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
OPERATIONS
REPUTATION: The Company has established a reputation as a highly-regarded landlord with an emphasis on delivering quality tenant services in buildings it owns and/or manages. The Company believes that its continued success depends in part on enhancing its reputation as an operator of choice, which will facilitate the retention of current tenants and the attraction of new tenants. The Company believes it provides a superior level of service to its tenants, which should in turn allow the Company to outperform the market with respect to occupancy rates, as well as improve tenant retention.
COMMUNICATION WITH TENANTS: The Company emphasizes frequent communication with tenants to ensure first-class service to the Properties. Property managers generally are located on site at the Properties to provide convenient access to management and to ensure that the Properties are well-maintained. Property management's primary responsibility is to ensure that buildings are operated at peak efficiency in order to meet both the Company's and tenants' needs and expectations. Property managers additionally budget and oversee capital improvements and building system upgrades to enhance the Properties' competitive advantages in their markets and to maintain the quality of the Company's properties.
Additionally, the Company's in-house leasing representatives develop and maintain long-term relationships with the Company's diverse tenant base and coordinate leasing, expansion, relocation and build-to-suit opportunities within the Company's portfolio. This approach allows the Company to offer office space in the appropriate size and location to current or prospective tenants in any of its sub-markets.
GROWTH
The Company plans to continue to own and operate a portfolio of properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets, with a primary focus in the Northeast. The Company's primary objectives are to maximize funds from operations and to enhance the value of its portfolio through effective management, acquisition, development and property sales strategies, as follows:
INTERNAL GROWTH: The Company seeks to maximize the value of its existing portfolio through implementing operating strategies designed to produce increased effective rental and occupancy rates and decreased tenant installation costs. The Company continues to pursue internal growth through re-leasing space at higher effective rents with contractual rent increases and developing or redeveloping space for its diverse base of high credit tenants, including IBM Corporation, Nabisco Inc. and Allstate Insurance Company. In addition, the Company seeks economies of scale through volume discounts to take advantage of its size and dominance in particular sub-markets, and operating efficiencies through the use of in-house management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, development and construction services.
ACQUISITIONS: The Company also believes that growth opportunities exist through acquiring operating properties or properties for redevelopment with attractive returns in its core Northeast sub-markets where, based on its expertise in leasing, managing and operating properties, it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. The Company intends to acquire, invest in or redevelop additional properties that: (i) provide attractive initial yields with potential for growth in cash flow from operations; (ii) are well-located, of high quality and competitive in their respective sub-markets; (iii) are located in its existing sub-markets or in sub-markets in which the Company can become a significant and preferred owner and operator; and (iv) have been under-managed or are otherwise capable of improved performance through intensive management, capital improvements and/or leasing that should result in increased occupancy and rental revenues.
DEVELOPMENT: The Company seeks to selectively develop additional properties where it believes such development will result in a favorable risk-adjusted return on investment in coordination with the above operating strategies. Such development primarily will occur: (i) when leases have been executed prior to construction; (ii) in stable core Northeast sub-markets where the demand for such space exceeds available supply; and (iii) where the Company is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator.
The Company, directly or through joint ventures, is underway on the construction of six office and office/flex buildings. The most significant of this development activity is currently at the Company's Harborside Financial Center office complex in Jersey City, New Jersey. Three of the six properties currently under construction are located at the complex and consist of two office towers, aggregating approximately 1.6 million square feet, and a 350-room Hyatt Regency hotel. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capitalization."
PROPERTY SALES: The Company plans to sell substantially all of its properties located in the Southwestern and Western regions, using such proceeds primarily to invest in property acquisitions and development projects in its core Northeast markets. Additionally, while management's principal intention is to own and operate its properties on a long-term basis, it is constantly assessing the attributes of each of its properties, with a particular focus on the supply and demand fundamentals of the sub-markets in which they are located. Based on these ongoing assessments, the Company may, from time to time, decide to sell any of its properties.
FINANCIAL
The Company currently intends to maintain a ratio of debt-to-undepreciated assets (total debt of the Company as a percentage of total undepreciated assets) of approximately 50 percent or less. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's total debt constituted approximately 41.5 percent of total undepreciated assets of the Company. The Company has three investment grade credit ratings. Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") and Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch") have each assigned their BBB rating to existing and prospective senior unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. S&P and Fitch have also assigned their BBB- rating to prospective preferred stock offerings of the Company. Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has assigned its Baa3 rating to existing and prospective senior unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and its Ba1 rating to prospective preferred stock offerings of the Company. Although there is no limit in the Company's organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness that the Company may incur or the requirement for maintenance of investment grade credit ratings, the Company has entered into certain financial agreements which contain covenants that limit the Company's ability to incur indebtedness under certain circumstances. The Company intends to conduct its operations so as to best be able to maintain its investment grade rated status. The Company intends to utilize the most appropriate sources of capital for future acquisitions, development, capital improvements and other investments, which may include funds from operating activities, proceeds from property sales, short-term and long-term borrowings (including draws on the Company's revolving credit facility), and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately 380 employees.
COMPETITION
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The Properties compete for tenants with lessors and developers of similar properties located in their respective markets primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided, and the design and condition of the Properties. The Company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire or dispose of real estate, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors.
REGULATIONS
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to the Properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.
Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in the property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances. The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner's ability to rent or sell the property or to borrow using such property as collateral and may expose it to liability resulting from any release of, or exposure to, such substances. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances.
In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real properties, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental penalties and injuries to persons and property.
There can be no assurance that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, (ii) the current environmental condition of the Properties will not be affected by tenants, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the Properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to the Company, or (iii) the Company's assessments reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are no material environmental liabilities of which the Company is aware. If compliance with the various laws and regulations, now existing or hereafter adopted, exceeds the Company's budgets for such items, the Company's ability to make expected distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.
There are no other laws or regulations which have a material effect on the Company's operations, other than typical federal, state and local laws affecting the development and operation of real property, such as zoning laws.
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
The Company operates in only one industry segment - real estate. The Company does not have any foreign operations and its business is not seasonal.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
In September 2001, the Company announced a 1.6 percent increase in its quarterly dividend, commencing with the Company's dividend with respect to the third quarter of 2001, from $0.61 per share of Common Stock ($2.44 per share of Common Stock on an annualized basis) to $0.62 per share of Common Stock ($2.48 per share of Common Stock on an annualized basis). The Company declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per share on December 18, 2001 to shareholders of record as of January 4, 2002, with respect to the fourth quarter of 2001. The dividend was paid on January 22, 2002. The Company has increased its quarterly dividend for seven consecutive years representing an increase of 53.5 percent over the period.
In 2001, the Company:
o acquired ten office and office/flex properties aggregating 901,888 square feet at a total cost of approximately $96.6 million; o placed in service two office properties aggregating 405,254 square feet at a total cost of approximately $82.3 million; o acquired two developable land parcels at a total cost of approximately $3.7 million; and o sold seven office properties aggregating 1,021,823 square feet, a multi-family residential property and a vacant pier for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately $164.1 million.
Additionally, in 2001, the Company, through unconsolidated joint ventures, placed in service a 369,682 square foot office property; and sold two office properties, aggregating 372,926 square feet, for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately $84.5 million. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for further information regarding joint venture activity.
OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS
The Company acquired the following operating properties during the year ended December 31, 2001:
(a) Transactions were funded primarily through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility, from net proceeds received in the sale or sales of rental property, and/or from the Company's cash reserves. (b) The Company acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in this property from an unconsolidated joint venture. Investment by Company represents the net cost of acquiring the remaining interest. (c) The property was acquired from an entity whose principals include Timothy M. Jones, Robert F. Weinberg and Martin S. Berger, each of whom are affiliated with the Company as the President of the Company, a current member of the Board of Directors and a former member of the Board of Directors of the Company, respectively. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements.
PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE
The Company placed in service the following properties during the year ended December 31, 2001:
(a) Development costs were funded primarily through draws on the Company's revolving credit facility.
LAND ACQUISITIONS
On January 5, 2001, the Company acquired approximately 7.1 acres of developable land located in Littleton, Arapahoe County, Colorado, for approximately $2.7 million. When the Company had committed itself to acquire the land, the Company had intended to develop the site consistent with its then business strategy. Due to a change in the Company's strategy, this land is currently held for sale (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements).
On September 13, 2001, the Company acquired approximately 5.0 acres of developable land located in Elmsford, Westchester County, New York. The land was acquired for approximately $1.0 million from an entity whose principals include Timothy M. Jones, Robert F. Weinberg and Martin S. Berger, each of whom are affiliated with the Company as the President of the Company, a current member of the Board of Directors and a former member of the Board of Directors of the Company, respectively. The Company has commenced construction of a fully pre-leased 33,000 square-foot office/flex building on the acquired land.
PROPERTY SALES
The Company sold the following properties during the year ended December 31, 2001:
(a) Net sales proceeds consisted of $1,330 in cash and $2,027 of a note receivable due in 2002.
In January 2002, the Company sold 25 Martine Avenue, a 124-unit multi-family residential property located in White Plains, Westchester County, New York, for net sales proceeds of approximately $17.8 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $7.3 million.
FINANCING ACTIVITY
ISSUANCES OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES
On January 29, 2001, the Operating Partnership issued $300.0 million face amount of 7.75 percent senior unsecured notes due February 15, 2011 with interest payable semi-annually in arrears. The total proceeds from the issuance (net of selling commissions and discount) of approximately $296.3 million were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the 2000 Unsecured Facility (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements). The senior unsecured notes were issued at a discount of approximately $1.7 million.
MORTGAGE FINANCING
On May 18, 2001, the Company obtained an additional $70.0 million in proceeds from Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and Principal Capital Management, LLC on a mortgage loan secured by Harborside Financial Center Plazas 2 and 3. The mortgage on Plazas 2 and 3, with a balance of $162.0 million at December 31, 2001, bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 7.36 percent and matures in January 2006. Proceeds from the financing were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility.
STOCK REPURCHASES
On September 13, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company's repurchase program under which the Company is permitted to purchase up to an additional $150.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock ("Repurchase Program"). From that date through February 14, 2002, the Company purchased for constructive retirement under the Repurchase Program 3.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $91.1 million, of which 1.3 million shares were repurchased in 2001 for a total cost of $35.4 million. As a result, the Company has a remaining authorization to repurchase up to an additional $58.9 million of its outstanding common stock, which it may repurchase from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions.
RISK FACTORS
Our results from operations and ability to make distributions on our equity and debt service on our indebtedness may be affected by the risk factors set forth below. All investors should consider the following risk factors before deciding to purchase securities of the Company. The Company refers to itself as "we" or "our" in the following risk factors.
WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMICS OF THE NORTHEASTERN OFFICE MARKETS.
A majority of our revenues are derived from our properties located in the Northeast, particularly in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Adverse economic developments in this region could adversely impact the operations of our properties and, therefore, our profitability. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office and office/flex buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decline in the economy and/or a decline in the demand for office space may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
The current economic downturn has resulted in a receding real estate market, the relocation of companies and an uncertain economic future for many businesses. We are uncertain how long the current downturn will last. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 in New York and Washington, D.C. (and the uncertainty as to whether there may be more) may exacerbate this downturn or cause it to linger and may also result in increases in certain of our expenses for items such as security. The current economic downturn and the events of September 11 may also be having a negative economic impact on most industries, including securities, insurance services, telecommunications and computer systems and other technology, businesses in which many of our tenants are involved. Such economic impact may cause our tenants to have difficulty or be unable to meet their obligations to us.
OUR PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY.
GENERAL: Our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors depends on the ability of our properties to generate funds in excess of operating expenses (including scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements). Events or conditions that are beyond our control may adversely affect our operations and the value of our properties. Such events or conditions could include:
o changes in the general economic climate; o changes in local conditions such as oversupply of office space or a reduction in demand for office space; o decreased attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants; o competition from other office and office/flex buildings; o our inability to provide adequate maintenance; o increased operating costs, including insurance premiums and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; o changes in laws and regulations (including tax, environmental and housing laws and regulations) and agency or court interpretations of such laws and regulations and the related costs of compliance; o changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing; o the inability of a significant number of tenants to pay rent; o our inability to rent office space on favorable terms; and o civil unrest, earthquakes and other natural disasters or acts of God that may result in uninsured losses.
FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY RENT: If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and protecting our investments. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, a potential court judgment rejecting and terminating such tenant's lease could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE ON OUR PROPERTIES MAY BE INADEQUATE: We currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire and flood. Our existing insurance policies expire in April 2002. As a consequence of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. If any or all of the foregoing should occur, we may not have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property or properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property or properties. Nevertheless, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property or properties. We cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
ILLIQUIDITY OF REAL ESTATE LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ACT QUICKLY: Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Such illiquidity may limit our ability to react quickly in response to changes in economic and other conditions. If we want to sell an investment, we might not be able to dispose of that investment in the time period we desire, and the sales price of that investment might not recoup or exceed the amount of our investment. The prohibition in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale also may restrict our ability to sell property. In addition, we acquired a significant number of our properties from individuals to whom we issued limited partnership units as part of the purchase price. In connection with the acquisition of these properties, in order to preserve such individual's tax deferral, we contractually agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties for a specified period of time, subject to certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2001, 141 of our properties, with an aggregate net book value of approximately $1.9 billion, were subject to these restrictions. The above limitations on our ability to sell our investments could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT COMPLIANCE COULD BE COSTLY: Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons' entrances. Other federal, state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such accesses. Although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements, noncompliance with the ADA or related laws or regulations could result in the United States government imposing fines or private litigants being awarded damages against us. Such costs may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE POSSIBLE AND MAY BE COSTLY: Various federal, state and local laws and regulations subject property owners or operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in the property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for or even knew of the presence of such substances. The presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances (such as toxic mold) may adversely affect our ability to rent, sell or borrow against contaminated property. Various laws and regulations also impose liability on persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for such disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. Certain other environmental laws and regulations impose liability on owners or operators of property for injuries relating to the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air. As owners and operators of property and as potential arrangers for hazardous substance disposal, we may be liable under such laws and regulations for removal or remediation costs, governmental penalties, property damage, personal injuries and related expenses. Payment of such costs and expenses could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED PRICES FOR PROPERTIES: We plan to acquire additional properties in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania and in the Northeast generally. We may be competing for investment opportunities with entities that have greater financial resources. Several office building developers and real estate companies may compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition, land for development and prospective tenants. Such competition may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors by:
o reducing the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us; o increasing the bargaining power of property owners; o interfering with our ability to attract and retain tenants; o increasing vacancies which lowers market rental rates and limits our ability to negotiate rental rates; and/or o adversely affecting our ability to minimize expenses of operation.
DEVELOPMENT OF REAL ESTATE COULD BE COSTLY: As part of our operating strategy, we may acquire land for development under certain conditions. Included among the risks of the real estate development business are the following, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors:
o financing for development projects may not be available on favorable terms; o long-term financing may not be available upon completion of construction; and o failure to complete construction on schedule or within budget may increase debt service expense and construction costs.
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THROUGH JOINT VENTURES COULD SUBJECT US TO THE CONTRARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES OF OUR CO-VENTURERS: We, from time to time, invest in joint ventures or partnerships in which we do not hold a controlling interest. These investments involve risks that do not exist with properties in which we own a controlling interest, including the possibility that our co-venturers or partners may, at any time, have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives. Because we lack a controlling interest, our co-venturers or partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. While the Company seeks protective rights against such company action, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in procuring any such protective rights, or if procured, that the rights will be sufficient to fully protect the Company against contrary actions. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in joint ventures or partnerships. If the objectives of our co-venturers or partners are inconsistent with ours, it may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors.
DEBT FINANCING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.
SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS AND REFINANCING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION: We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing. These risks, including the following, may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors:
o our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; o payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses; o we may not be able to refinance indebtedness on our properties at maturity; and o if refinanced, the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the original terms of the related indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2001, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $1.7 billion comprised of $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, outstanding borrowings of $59.5 million under our unsecured $800.0 million revolving credit facility and approximately $543.8 million of mortgage indebtedness. We may have to refinance the principal due on our indebtedness at maturity, and we may not be able to refinance any indebtedness we incur in the future.
If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, events or conditions that may adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors include the following:
o we may need to dispose of one or more of our properties upon disadvantageous terms; o prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase interest rates and, therefore, our interest expense; o if we mortgage property to secure payment of indebtedness and are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon such property or appoint a receiver to receive an assignment of our rents and leases; and o foreclosures upon mortgaged property could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds and, therefore, hinder our ability to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
RISING INTEREST RATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW: Outstanding borrowings of approximately $59.5 million (as of December 31, 2001) under our revolving credit facility and approximately $32.2 million (as of December 31, 2001) of our mortgage indebtedness bear interest at variable rates. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that also bears interest at variable rates. Variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase. Higher debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors and/or cause us to default under certain debt covenants.
OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW: We fund acquisition opportunities and development partially through short-term borrowings (including our revolving credit facility), as well as from proceeds from property sales and undistributed cash. We expect to refinance projects purchased with short-term debt either with long-term indebtedness or equity financing depending upon the economic conditions at the time of refinancing. Our Board of Directors has a general policy of limiting the ratio of our indebtedness to total undepreciated assets (total debt as a percentage of total undepreciated assets) to 50 percent or less, although there is no limit in Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.'s or our organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. However, we have entered into certain financial agreements which contain financial and operating covenants that limit our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. The Board of Directors could alter or eliminate its current policy on borrowing at any time in its discretion. If this policy were changed, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors and/or could cause an increased risk of default on our obligations.
WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL WHOSE CONTINUED SERVICE IS NOT GUARANTEED.
We are dependent upon our executive officers for strategic business direction and real estate experience. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, loss of their services could adversely affect our operations. We have entered into an employment agreement (including non-competition provisions) which provides for a continuous four-year employment term with each of Mitchell E. Hersh, Timothy M. Jones, Barry Lefkowitz and Roger W. Thomas. We also have entered into an employment agreement (including non-competition provisions) with Michael A. Grossman which provides for an initial three year employment term and a continuous one-year term from and after the two-year anniversary of the execution of the agreement. We do not have key man life insurance for our executive officers.
CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP LIMITS COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST: In order for us to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, not more than 50 percent in value of our outstanding stock may be actually and/or constructively owned by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities). We have limited the ownership of our outstanding shares of our common stock by any single stockholder to 9.8 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors could waive this restriction if they were satisfied, based upon the advice of tax counsel or otherwise, that such action would be in our best interests and would not affect our qualifications as a real estate investment trust. Common stock acquired or transferred in breach of the limitation may be redeemed by us for the lesser of the price paid and the average closing price for the 10 trading days immediately preceding redemption or sold at the direction of us. We may elect to redeem such shares of common stock for limited partnership units, which are nontransferable except in very limited circumstances. Any transfer of shares of common stock which, as a result of such transfer, causes us to be in violation of any ownership limit will be deemed void. Although we currently intend to continue to operate in a manner which will enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke the election for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust. Under our organizational documents, our Board of Directors can make such revocation without the consent of our stockholders.
In addition, the consent of the holders of at least 85 percent of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.'s partnership units is required: (i) to merge (or permit the merger of) us with another unrelated person, pursuant to a transaction in which Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. is not the surviving entity; (ii) to dissolve, liquidate or wind up Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.; or (iii) to convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.'s assets. As general partner, we own approximately 79.8 percent of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.'s outstanding partnership units (assuming conversion of all preferred limited partnership units).
TAX LIABILITIES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST: We have elected to be treated and have operated so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1994. Although we believe we will continue to operate in such manner, we cannot guarantee that we will do so. Qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the satisfaction of various requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Because few judicial or administrative interpretations of such provisions exist and qualification determinations are fact sensitive, we cannot assure you that we will qualify as a real estate investment trust for any taxable year.
If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, we will be subject to the following:
o we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends to shareholders; o we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any alternative minimum tax, if applicable; and o unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we will not be permitted to qualify as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.
A loss of our status as a real estate investment trust could have an adverse effect on us. Failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust also would eliminate the requirement that we pay dividends to our stockholders.
OTHER TAX LIABILITIES: Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and, in some circumstances, certain other state and local taxes. Our net income from third party management and tenant improvements, if any, also may be subject to federal income tax.
RISK OF CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW APPLICABLE TO REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS: Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our and Mack-Cali Realty, L.P.'s tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us, Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., and/or our investors.

(a) Based on all leases in effect as of December 31, 2001. (b) Total base rent for 2001, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Substantially all of the leases provide for annual base rents plus recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant's proportionate share of and/or increases in real estate taxes and certain operating costs, as defined, and the pass through of charges for electrical usage. (c) Total base rent for 2001 minus total 2001 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP. (d) Base rent for 2001 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2001. For those properties acquired or placed in service during 2001, amounts are annualized, as per Note g. (e) Effective rent for 2001 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2001. For those properties acquired or placed in service during 2001, amounts are annualized, as per Note g. (f) Excludes space leased by the Company. (g) As this property was acquired or placed in service by the Company during 2001, the amounts represented in 2001 base rent and 2001 effective rent reflect only that portion of the year during which the Company owned or placed the property in service. Accordingly, these amounts may not be indicative of the property's full year results. For comparison purposes, the amounts represented in 2001 average base rent per sq. ft. and 2001 average effective rent per sq. ft. for this property have been calculated by taking 2001 base rent and 2001 effective rent for such property and annualizing these partial-year results, dividing such annualized amounts by the net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2001. These annualized per square foot amounts may not be indicative of the property's results had the Company owned or placed such property in service for the entirety of 2001. (h) The property was sold by the Company in 2001. (i) Calculation based on square feet in service as of December 31, 2001. (j) The Company constructed an expansion to this building increasing its size by 31,000 square feet. (k) Property is excluded from weighted average percentage leased as it was an in-service development property as of December 31, 2001. Had these properties been included, weighted average percentage leased for total office, office/flex, and industrial/warehouse properties would be 94.1 percent.
