ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
GENERAL
The 46 Properties consist of 44 Multifamily Properties and two Retail Properties, as described in more detail below. Thirty of the Multifamily Properties and both Retail Properties were acquired in connection with the Formation Transactions, two additional Multifamily Properties were acquired in 1994, five additional Multifamily Properties were acquired and one additional Multifamily Property was developed and delivered in 1995, four additional Multifamily Properties were acquired in 1996 (one of which was later combined with another Property for operational and
statistical purposes), and three additional Multifamily Properties were acquired in the first quarter of 1997. In addition, the Operating Partnership holds minority limited partnership interests in two other multifamily apartment properties in the Washington metropolitan area, acquired in the Formation Transactions and increased in a subsequent transaction.
All of the Operating Partnership's properties are located in developed areas that include other residential and retail properties. The number of competitive residential properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Operating Partnership's ability to lease apartment units and on the rents charged. In addition, other forms of single and multifamily residential properties provide housing alternatives to tenants and potential tenants of the Operating Partnership's residential properties. The Operating Partnership's retail properties face similar competition with other retail properties with respect to tenant leases. The Operating Partnership believes that the properties are well located in their markets and are well constructed and designed. In the opinion of management, the Operating Partnership's properties are adequately covered by insurance.
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES
The 44 Multifamily Properties are located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and contain a total of 17,028 garden, mid-rise, and high-rise apartment units, ranging in size from 115 to 1,065 units. All of the Multifamily Properties are 100% owned by the Operating Partnership, the Company, and their subsidiaries. The Smith Companies developed and built 27 of the Multifamily Properties owned by the Operating Partnership (not including the recently- completed Westerly at Worldgate, which was developed by the Operating Partnership but constructed by an affiliate of the Smith Companies). In 1996, the average monthly rental revenue per unit was $883 and the average economic occupancy was 97.0% for the Core Residential Portfolio (Multifamily Properties acquired in the Formation Transaction or in other transactions prior to December 31, 1994.)
Each of the Multifamily Properties is established in its local market and provides residents with numerous amenities and services, which may include 24-hour desk service, swimming pools, tennis courts, exercise rooms and/or saunas, day care centers, party or meeting rooms, tenant newsletters, and laundry facilities. Nearly all units are wired for cable television, and many units also offer additional features, such as washer/dryer, microwave, fireplace, and patio/balcony. The Operating Partnership maintains an ongoing program of regular maintenance and capital improvements and renovations, including roof replacement and exterior maintenance, kitchen and bath renovations, balcony repairs, and replacements of various building systems.
The following table sets forth certain additional information relating to the Multifamily Properties as of December 31, 1996 (in the following table, occupancy is based upon economic occupancy, which measures occupancy beginning on the rent commencement date; monthly revenue per unit is total property revenue divided by the number of apartment units; and certain data may be omitted for properties not operated by the Operating Partnership for the entire year):

RETAIL PROPERTIES
The Operating Partnership's two Retail Properties, Skyline Mall and Worldgate Centre, are enclosed malls containing a total of approximately 436,000 square feet of retail space. Both Retail Properties lease health club facilities to entities controlled by Messrs. Smith and Kogod pursuant to leases which expire on December 31, 2015.
WORLDGATE CENTRE. Worldgate Centre is a community retail center located in Herndon, Virginia, at the intersection of two major Northern Virginia traffic arteries, the Dulles Airport Access Highway and Centreville Road. Developed by the Smith Companies in 1991, it is a part of a mixed-use development which includes the 320-unit multifamily development project of the Operating Partnership that was opened in the spring of 1995. In addition to this immediate market, this Property is located in Fairfax County, the highest median income county in the country. It contains the 108,670 square foot Worldgate Athletic Club, a Loews Cinema, and a mix of approximately 40 other food service, fashion and specialty retailers and various business and general service tenants. Worldgate Centre has 230,926 square feet of leasable area and had an average occupancy rate of 99.8% during 1996. Approximately 17.3% of the leases, based on net rentable area, are scheduled to expire prior to the year 2001.
SKYLINE MALL. Skyline Mall is a two-level, enclosed community retail center located on Route 7 in Northern Virginia, at the intersection of Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the City of Alexandria, Virginia. Originally developed by the Smith Companies in 1977, it is part of a mixed-use community which also includes over two million square feet of office space and over 3,300 high-rise condominium and apartment units (including Skyline Towers, a 940-unit Multifamily Property owned by the Operating Partnership), all within walking distance. The Property has 204,914 square feet of leasable area and had an average occupancy rate of 95.1% in 1996. It contains the 79,920 square foot Skyline Racquet and Health Club, an AMC Cinema, and approximately 40 other stores, including restaurants, fashion and specialty retailers, and various business and general services. Approximately 20.1% of the leases, based on net rentable area, are scheduled to expire prior to the year 2001.
The following table sets forth certain additional information relating to the Retail Properties as of December 31, 1996 (figures include space leased to two health clubs affiliated with Messrs. Smith and Kogod):

LAND
The Operating Partnership has executed a contract to purchase an unimproved 17.03 acre site in Springfield, Virginia for the construction thereon of a 630- unit, multi-phase, low-rise and mid-rise multifamily apartment complex. The Operating Partnership also has a contract and intends to acquire a 36-acre site in Reston, Virginia for the construction thereon of an approximately 375-unit multifamily apartment complex. The Operating Partnership may, from time-to-time, acquire unimproved land for the purpose of future development.
PROPERTY MARKETS
The Operating Partnership believes that the demographic and economic trends and conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the market where the Properties are located, indicate a potential for continued high occupancy and moderate rental rate growth in 1997.
All of the Operating Partnership's Properties are located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, which traditionally has been, and which the Operating Partnership believes will continue to be, among the strongest regions in the United States for multifamily rental properties and one of the most stable markets compared to many other markets which encounter significant fluctuations over time. The region is the country's fifth largest employment market with over 2.9 million jobs, and is projected to add 648,000 jobs over the period 1993 to 2005, an average increase of over 50,000 jobs annually, according to projections prepared by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and released in mid-1996. This is the third largest projected employment increase of all U.S. cities as indicated on the following table:

According to the same Department of Commerce projections, the Washington D.C. metro area is also projected to have the third largest population increase of all U.S. cities as shown in the following table:

A significant factor contributing to the employment and population increases projected for the Washington D.C. metropolitan area is the continuing growth of the technology sector, particularly the information technology segment. The Washington area is estimated to be similar in number of technology jobs (256,000) to San Jose/Silicon Valley in California (283,000) and Boston/Route 128 in Massachusetts (311,500), according to a study conducted by The Center for Regional Analysis, George Mason University, using 1992 data. This study also concluded that the technology segment in the Washington D.C. area is "...most likely, the fastest growing" of the three regions.
The continuing strength of the technology sector has been a key factor enabling the region to maintain economic growth notwithstanding Federal Government downsizing over the past three years. Over the three-year period 1994 through and including 1996, 131,900 new wage and salary jobs were added in the region, which more than offset 44,100 Federal government jobs "downsized" over the same period, resulting in a net job increase of 87,800 jobs over the period, according to data derived by the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia from original data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economic growth in the Washington metro area in 1996 was adversely affected by the 1996 Federal budget stalemate and related government shutdowns, however 27,400 new jobs were added during the year, which offset the loss of 14,800 Federal government jobs during this period, resulting in a net job increase of 12,600. In recent years employment growth has been considerably stronger in the Northern Virginia segment of the metropolitan area (33,600 net increase in 1996), which is the sector where the majority of the Operating Partnership's properties are located (76% of units), and the Operating Partnership believes that this trend will continue due to the concentration of technology firms in Northern Virginia.
Demand for multi-family rental apartments continues to be strong in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as evidenced by high occupancy rates. Annual surveys of approximately 80% of comparable investment grade apartment properties conducted by The REIS Reports, Inc. have indicated that the overall market-wide occupancy rates were 96.4% in January 1997, 96.5% in the first quarter of 1996, and 95.9% in the first quarter of 1995. The average occupancy rate of the Operating Partnership's Core Residential Portfolio was 97.0% in 1996, which is higher than the overall market average (which was determined on a physical occupancy basis that typically yields a slightly higher occupancy percentage than the economic basis on which the Operating Partnership's occupancy percentage is calculated). The REIS Reports, Inc. forecast in March 1996 that the average annual apartment occupancy in the Washington metropolitan area in the 1997 - 2001 period will be between 95.7% and 96.9%, and annual rental rate increases will average between 3.8% and 4.6%, in both cases above its forecast for the U.S. averages.
The supply of multifamily properties has been increasing moderately in the Washington metropolitan area over the past several years and is likely to continue to do so based on multifamily permits data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data show that the numbers of multifamily permits issued in the area were 5,202 in 1994, 5,952 in 1995 and 7,786 in 1996, and these data include both for-sale condominium and rental apartment properties. These levels remain well below the peak of over 13,000 in 1987. Most of the new supply of rental apartments is occurring in the outer suburban areas and does not compete directly with the Operating Partnership's properties, which are predominantly in the vicinity of and within Interstate Highway 495, the Capital Beltway.
Overall, the Operating Partnership believes that the anticipated increases in employment and population projected for the Washington D.C. area, together with moderate increases in supply of new rental units in locations competitive with the Operating Partnership's properties, will result in the Operating Partnership's multifamily rental submarkets remaining in a strong occupancy position for at least the next 18 - 24 months. As a result, the Operating Partnership believes that these conditions will provide an opportunity to improve apartment rent levels and investment values, and will also allow new development opportunities.
MORTGAGE FINANCING
Thirty-three of the 43 Properties owned at December 31, 1996 were subject to Mortgage Loans aggregating approximately $416,808,000 as of December 31, 1996. The Mortgage Loans are collateralized by nonrecourse first lien mortgages or deeds of trust on Properties organized into four pools ("Mortgage Pool One," "Mortgage Pool Two," "Mortgage Pool Three," and "Mortgage Pool Four", as shown in the chart below) and three individual loans (the "Acquisition Mortgages"), and bear interest at a weighted average interest rate of 8.01% at December 31, 1996. The Properties collateralizing each Mortgage Loan, the outstanding principal balances as of December 31, 1996, the applicable interest rates, and the maturity dates for each Mortgage Loan are set forth in the chart below.
Each of the related loan agreements for Mortgage Pool One and Mortgage Pool Two requires the payment of interest only and contains cross-collateral and cross-default provisions among the separate financing partnership borrowers in each pool. Prepayment of these loans would be subject to a yield maintenance premium. The loan secured by Mortgage Pool Three is interest only through June 30, 1999, at which time amortization begins using a 25-year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. In addition, this loan may not be prepaid until May 1, 1999, at which time it would be subject to a yield maintenance premium. In January, 1996 this financing was modified to extend the term for an additional five years to June 30, 2009, and was cross-collateralized with a new $83 million permanent line of credit from the same lender, as described below. Certain predecessor partners executed guarantees for $42 million of the mortgage loans secured by Mortgage Pool Three. The loan secured by Mortgage Pool Four was refinanced in September 1996 and was obtained jointly with a ground lessor, with a portion of the principal allocated to each of them. The ground lessor has been allocated $9.9 million of the refinanced loan (of the total of $41.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 1996), for which the Operating Partnership is contingently liable. The loan requires the payment of interest only through August 2004, at which time amortization begins using a 30- year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due in August 2009. The Operating Partnership remits full debt service to the lender and reduces its ground rent payment by the corresponding amount of debt service relating to the principal assigned to the ground lessor.
The Acquisition Mortgages relate to the 1995 and 1996 acquisitions of three Properties by the Operating Partnership. The Acquisition Mortgage for Connecticut Heights was assumed in connection with the purchase of this Property on June 30, 1995. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 1996, was $17,245,000 (it has subsequently been significantly reduced) and it matures on June 30, 1997. The loan amortizes through maturity and has a variable interest rate equal to a blended LIBOR rate plus 1.70% (7.2% as of December 31, 1996). The Acquisition Mortgage for the Bennington was assumed in connection with the purchase of this Property on September 29, 1995. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 1996, was $12,870,000, and it matures on October 31, 2020. The loan amortizes through maturity and carries a fixed interest rate of 7.50%. The Acquisition Mortgage for 1841 Columbia Road was assumed in connection with the purchase of this Property on August 1, 1996. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 1996, was $3,244,000, at a fixed interest rate of 9.00% per annum and a maturity date of August 1, 1999.
In addition to the mortgage debt shown on the chart below, a construction loan is secured by the Westerly, a property developed by the Operating Partnership. This interest-only loan had an outstanding balance of $17,686,000 on December 31, 1996, carried a blended floating interest rate of 7.32% at year end, and was to have matured on June 1, 1997; it has subsequently been repaid in full.
(1) Operated as a single property, but divided for collateralization purposes. (2) Twenty-five year amortization begins June 30, 1999. Also, reflects a five year extension agreed to in January 1996. (3) Thirty-year amortization begins in August 2004. (4) Interest rate is based on LIBOR plus 1.70%.
LINES OF CREDIT
The Operating Partnership has a $100,000,000 revolving line of credit with PNC Bank, NationsBank, and First Bank, of which $82,050,000 was outstanding at December 31, 1996. Amounts outstanding bear interest at a selected LIBOR rate plus 1.625% (7.155% at December 31, 1996). The Operating Partnership pays a fee of .125% on any unused portions of the line of credit plus the costs of setting up the credit facility. The facility expires on June 30, 1997, with two one-year extension options thereafter on the same terms. Borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by the Albemarle, Worldgate Centre, Manor, Potomac View, Suburban Tower, Boulevard of Old Town/Governor Spotswood, and Van Ness South apartments properties. This line of credit was repaid in the amount of $54.4 million in the first quarter of 1997. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.
In January, 1996, the Operating Partnership secured a new $83 million credit facility from Northwestern Mutual Life to be used for property acquisitions. It expires in June 2004 and for the first two years provides for an interest rate that is fixed at the time of each acquisition at a spread of 1.50% over the rate of 10-year Treasury Bills. Any properties acquired in this fashion will secure the facility, and it is cross-collateralized with Mortgage Pool Three. In January 1996, the Operating Partnership drew $16,000,000 under this credit facility (and reduced by a like amount the outstanding balance under its other line of credit) and collateralized it with the Oakwood property; this line component bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.09%. In March, 1996, the Operating Partnership
drew $14,000,000 under this credit facility and collateralized it with the Charter Oaks property; this line component bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.48%. The blended rate for the two components is 7.2%. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.
Subsequent to the Company's stock offering in the first quarter of 1997 and the related debt repayment, the Operating Partnership had approximately $126 million of unused borrowing capacity available on lines of credit.
