THE OFFICE BUILDING -------------------
The Office Building is a 17-story deluxe office building featuring a lobby atrium garden and a 130-foot hanging sculpture, with The Market at Bethesda Metro, a glass enclosed retail pavilion of European design containing three levels of shopping, restaurants, convenience stores, services and offices, connected to it at the plaza level. An outdoor plaza offers year-round activities. In the winter months, an outdoor ice arena is centrally located in the plaza. During the warmer months, the ice arena converts into an outdoor eating plaza and performing arts center, where outdoor cafes, vendors, sculptures, fountains and various activities are located. The Office Building is managed by Realty Management Company(Realty), a former affiliate of one of the Special Limited Partners.
As of December 31, 1996, the Office Building contains approximately 336,000 square feet of net rentable office space and approximately 18,000 square feet of net rentable retail and marketplace space, accessible to Metrobus and Metrorail.
LAND LEASE ----------
BMCLP entered into a non-recourse Land Lease with WMATA, dated December 1, 1981, pursuant to which BMCLP leases the land on which the Development is built for a term of 50 years, renewable at the option of BMCLP for an additional term of 49 years.
As of December 1, 1985 and continuing throughout the remainder of the initial lease term, BMCLP is required to pay WMATA a minimum annual rental of $1,600,000 in equal quarterly installments in advance. Further, BMCLP is obligated to pay WMATA additional rent in an amount equal to 7.5% of all Gross Income (which is defined in the Land Lease as gross receipts) in excess of $31,000,000, commencing in calendar year 1986 and payable within 90 days of the end of the calendar year to which each payment relates. In 1996, total land lease rental payments of $1,600,000 were made with no additional rent due for the calendar year 1996.
WMATA may terminate the Land Lease at least thirty (30) days after giving BMCLP notice if (1) BMCLP fails to make a payment of minimum or additional rent for 30 days after notice of such failure from WMATA or (2) BMCLP fails to perform any other covenants contained in the Land Lease for 60 days after notice of such failure from WMATA. No such default notices have been received.
BMCLP constructed its buildings on land it leases from WMATA. WMATA asserted claims against BMCLP concerning the deterioration of the concrete slab in areas that WMATA has used as a bus terminal and Kiss & Ride area since 1985. WMATA asserted that the deterioration is due to construction defects, but BMCLP takes the position that the deterioration is due to improper maintenance. The deterioration has reached the point that BMCLP's parking garage, which underlies the concrete slab, could be damaged. Accordingly, although BMCLP denies any legal liability for the repair of the concrete slab, it agreed to contribute $100,000 toward repair of the deck in exchange for a full release of any and all claims WMATA may have with respect to the design and construction issues. The estimated cost for repair is approximately $1,000,000, of which WMATA will pay all but the $100,000 contributed by BMCLP. BMCLP negotiated a release with WMATA, and in July 1996 submitted it together with the $100,000. On September

PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
26, 1996 the release and a settlement agreement were signed, thus releasing BMCLP from any liability over $100,000. The settlement agreement specifies work to be performed and WMATA's use of BMCLP's parking garage space for structural shoring during its repairs of the overhead concrete deck. The $100,000 is being held in trust until the work is completed or until WMATA requests payment.
WMATA held a meeting with representatives from Realty on January 31, 1997 to further discuss the details of the refurbishment program. A newly updated repair plan will be submitted to Realty by mid March, at that time it should be known how many parking spaces will be affected along with the duration of the construction. This estimated repair work will begin July 7, 1997.
MANAGEMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT -----------------------------
Hotel Management - ----------------
Hyatt manages the Hotel under the name of Hyatt Regency Bethesda, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Hotel Management Agreement dated March 1, 1982. The Hotel Management Agreement will expire on December 31, 2015, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. Hyatt is given substantial control and discretion in the operation of the Hotel, including the right on behalf of BMCLP to negotiate all agreements necessary to the operation of the Hotel and the right to determine the charges for rooms, entertainment, food and beverages, labor policies, and all phases of promotion and publicity relating to the Hotel.
Pursuant to the Hotel Management Agreement, Hyatt also provides "chain services" to the Hotel consisting of: (i) conventions, business and sales promotion services, (ii) advertising, publicity and public relations services, (iii) food and beverage, personnel and other departmental supervision and control services, and (iv) centralized reservations services, for which BMCLP is to pay its allocable share of the Hyatt expense.
Hyatt will be relieved from its obligation to operate the Hotel as a first-class hotel and may, in addition, terminate the Hotel Management Agreement if: (i) prevented from performing its obligations by events beyond Hyatt's control, (ii) in the event of a breach by BMCLP of any provision of the Hotel Management Agreement, or (iii) there is a limitation upon Hyatt's ability to expend funds for the Hotel, such as would result from BMCLP's failure to provide adequate working capital or replacement reserves, as required under the Hotel Management Agreement.
The Hotel Management Agreement places the following financial obligations upon BMCLP:
a. BMCLP must set aside 3% of gross receipts (as defined in the Hotel Management Agreement as all revenues and income of any kind from the Hotel) as a reserve for the replacement of the Hotel's furnishings and equipment.
b. BMCLP must assure that there is sufficient working capital on hand to make timely payment of all current obligations of the Hotel (including the annual management fee) and to assure the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the Hotel as a first class hotel development.
I-4
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
c. BMCLP must reimburse Hyatt for the Hotel's pro rata share of Hyatt's reservation expenses incurred in providing the chain services.
d. BMCLP must pay Hyatt an annual management fee of (i) a basic fee, equal to 4%, as set forth below, of the gross receipts of the Hotel; and (ii) a contingent incentive fee equal to the amount by which 20% of the profit, before management fees, for such fiscal year exceeds the basic fee payable for such fiscal year.
As of December 31, 1996 these financial obligations were met by BMCLP.
Pursuant to an amendment to its management agreement in connection with the 1992 loan modification with BMCLP's prior lender, which remains in effect as to Hyatt under the newly amended and restated first and second mortgage loans, Hyatt agreed to reduce its basic management fee from 4% to 3% from December 31, 1991 to December 31, 1995. In return for this reduction, BMCLP agreed to modify the Owner's Remittance of the Hotel Management Agreement, by extending the Sixth Full Year by one additional year for each year that Hyatt reduced its basic fee. In addition, the calculation of the contingent incentive fee includes the basic fee at the original 4%. As of January 1, 1996, the basic management fee has returned to 4%. Management fees paid to Hyatt for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were approximately $734,000, $520,000 and $482,000, respectively. The incentive fee earned for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was approximately $356,000, $232,000 and $134,000, respectively.
BMCLP can terminate the Hotel Management Agreement upon no less than 60 days written notice if, for two successive fiscal years after December 31, 1991 (referred to as the Sixth Full Year), the Hotel does not produce enough income to permit Hyatt to remit to BMCLP the sum of $6,250,000 for each such fiscal year (referred to as the Owner's Remittance). This shortfall occurred in 1996 and Hyatt and BMCLP expect it to occur during 1997. Accordingly, BMCLP explored the possibility of engaging a different hotel manager, but Hyatt would not agree to let the Partnership retain the franchise unless Hyatt managed the hotel. Instead, BMCLP and Hyatt are negotiating a new Hotel Management Agreement which will have a lower fee. BMCLP may not sell or transfer the Hotel or any portion thereof without the prior approval of Hyatt, which may not be unreasonably withheld and will be based upon, among other things, the ability of the prospective purchaser or transferee to fulfill BMCLP's financial obligations under the Hotel Management Agreement. Management can not currently project the impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the outcome of these negotiations.
Office Building Management - --------------------------
The Office Building is managed by Realty, an affiliate prior to July 1, 1988, of one of the Special Limited Partners. BMCLP entered into an agreement with Realty dated January 31, 1985, in which Realty was to manage the Office Building for a term of twenty years commencing from the date the Office Building opened. Under this agreement, Realty received a management fee equal to 4% of all income collected from the operation of the Office Building, to be paid monthly. However, Realty agreed to allow BMCLP to defer payment of its management fees, effective January 1, 1992, through the date of restructuring of the original debt.
I-5
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
In connection with the debt restructuring which occurred November 16, 1994, BMC Lender Partnership (BMC), the holder of the amended and restated second mortgage loan, paid Realty $1,000,000 to terminate its former twenty year management contract with BMCLP (which amount is not part of any financing for which BMCLP is liable). At that time BMCLP entered into a new management contract with Realty for a term of one year which will automatically renew for successive one year periods so long as Realty is not then in default of the management contract. The agreement provides for a management fee in the amount of 4% of total revenues. Of this amount, one-half or 2% shall be paid by Realty to BMC, during the term of the amended and restated second mortgage loan, in partial consideration for the $1,000,000 payment to terminate the original contract. Management fees for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were approximately $401,000, $391,000 and $357,000, respectively.
Realty was formed in 1976. It has informed the Partnership that it now has 20 employees and manages approximately 1,000,000 gross square feet of space.
As of December 31, 1996, there was approximately 3,257 square feet of office space available for rent in the Office Building. Retail and marketplace space was 92% occupied as of December 31, 1996. See page II-7 for average occupancy percentages.
Parking Garage Management - -------------------------
Monument Parking Co., Inc. (Monument) entered into a garage lease with BMCLP, dated March 14, 1983, pursuant to which BMCLP leased the underground parking garage from the date that it opened. Under the garage lease, Monument pays rent to BMCLP in an amount equal to the gross receipts of the parking garage less all operating expenses thereof, including an annual management fee to Monument in the amount of $65,000, until adjusted gross receipts (defined as all cash, revenue and compensation received from garage operations, reduced by parking taxes and other operating expenses) equal $1,500,000.
Monument retains 10% of all adjusted gross receipts in excess of $1,500,000 until the adjusted gross receipts reach $2,000,000, as an incentive fee. In addition, Monument retains 30% of all adjusted gross receipts in excess of $2,000,000, as a further incentive fee. In 1996, adjusted gross receipts equaled $1,154,985.
The garage lease requires Monument to provide parking privileges to tenants of the Office Building, their guests and employees and the guests and employees of the Hotel on a priority basis.
BMCLP FINANCING ---------------
Original Mortgage Debt - ----------------------
On December 23, 1985, BMCLP entered into a ten-year, nonrecourse mortgage note (the First Mortgage Note) with Great Western Bank (Great Western) in the amount of $120,000,000. The First Mortgage Note provided for a variable interest rate, adjustable monthly, of 2.75% in excess of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Eleventh District weighted-average cost of funds.
I-6
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
On July 1, 1987, BMCLP entered into a five-year nonrecourse mortgage note (the Second Mortgage Note) with Great Western for $10,000,000 together with a modification of the First Mortgage Note. Principal and accrued interest were due at maturity. The proceeds of this loan were used to fund operating deficit requirements. The Second Mortgage Note also provided for a variable interest rate, adjustable monthly, of 4% in excess of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Eleventh District weighted-average cost of funds.
On October 12, 1990, BMCLP was notified by Great Western that an event of default had occurred related to the nonpayment of its debt- service obligation under the First and Second Mortgage Notes (collectively, the Notes). Effective June 15, 1992, Great Western and BMCLP entered into a modification which superseded all previous modifications and was in effect until the restructuring on November 16, 1994, as discussed below.
The modification provided for interest to be accrued at the stated rate, adjusted as set forth in the original Notes, and interest payments in an amount equal to all of BMCLP's net cash flow, as defined, were due and payable monthly. All accrued but unpaid interest was added to principal and was to be due in full at maturity. No regular principal payments were required.
The modification also provided for quarterly payments (Excess Payments) to be paid to Great Western beginning March 1992. However, BMCLP paid all net cash flow to Great Western, and, therefore, did not itself have cash to make the Excess Payments. These Excess Payments were partially funded to Great Western from management fees waived by Hyatt and those deferred by Realty and Capitol Hotel Group (CHG), an affiliate of the General Partners. During 1994, BMCLP was advanced a total of $107,103, including accrued interest, from CRI for the payments of the Excess Payments due. BMCLP paid $796,876 of Excess Payments to Great Western in 1994, as required. Under the restructured debt, which occurred November 16, 1994, as discussed below, no further Excess Payments were required.
Restructuring of Original Mortgage Debt - ---------------------------------------
On November 16, 1994 Great Western sold the Notes to BMC Lender Partnership (BMC), an unaffiliated entity. BMC sold the First Mortgage Note to General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC), which amended and restated the First Mortgage Note (the Restated First Mortgage Note) to a principal amount of $48,000,000. BMC amended and restated the Second Mortgage Note (the Restated Second Mortgage Note) (collectively, the Restated Notes) to a principal amount of $10,000,000 advanced at closing. Of the total $58 million principal amount of the Restated Notes, $55 million was paid to Great Western in consideration for the Notes, approximately $1.8 million was used to fund loan fees and related costs on behalf of BMCLP, approximately $200,000 was used to fund interest and insurance premiums at the closing date and the remaining amount of approximately $1.0 million was deposited into an escrow account restricted for working capital requirements, as discussed in Note 2.
The Restated First Mortgage Note requires monthly interest payments in arrears, payable at 4.25% in excess of the GECC Composite Commercial Rate which at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 5.53% and 5.81%, respectively. In addition to monthly interest payments, monthly principal payments are due in the amount of $108,333. Furthermore, if certain major tenants of the Office Building, as defined in the Restated First Mortgage Note agreement, do not exercise an option to renew or cancel their leases, additional principal payments equal to 100% of
I-7
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
net cash flow, as defined, must be remitted to GECC. These payments must continue until the space vacated is 93% rented and other minimum financial conditions are met. All unpaid principal is due at the maturity date, which is November 30, 2001. Additional advances may be made by GECC in an aggregate amount not to exceed 50% of all previously made principal payments. Any additional advances are generally intended to fund tenant improvements, leasing costs and other capital improvements but may be used to fund other cash flow needs as well. For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, GECC advanced $975,001 and $216,666, respectively, to BMCLP for capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.
Annual principal payments due on the Restated First Mortgage Note are as follows:
1997 $ 1,299,996 1998 1,299,996 1999 1,299,996 2000 1,299,996 2001 40,417,016 ------------ Total $ 45,617,000 ============
Additionally, under the terms of the Restated First Mortgage Note, an interest reserve account to be used as additional collateral under the Restated First Mortgage Note must be established. Monthly payments of $23,125 must be made into this reserve beginning January 1, 1995, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, the interest reserve balance was $555,000 and $277,500, respectively.
The Restated Second Mortgage Note stipulates that 16% interest is payable monthly from available cash flow as defined on a cumulative basis. Based on the provisions of the Restated Second Mortgage Note, BMCLP s cash flow from operations shall be disbursed in the following priority:
a. Debt service and reserves on the Restated First Mortgage Note.
b. Establishment of working capital reserves of $50,000 plus an amount reasonably required to pay ordinary and necessary expenses of operations.
c. Debt service on the Restated Second Mortgage Note (to the extent of available cash flow).
d. Principal and interest on additional advances, as discussed below, if any, made to BMCLP by BMC.
e. 75% of the remaining net cash flow (as defined) to BMC and 25% of the remaining net cash flow to BMCLP (less up to $50,000 per year to cover management and administrative costs of the Partnership and/or CRCC), subject to the establishment of the reserves as stipulated in the agreement, as discussed below.
Furthermore, BMC is entitled to an Economic Value Participation Interest as defined which requires BMCLP to pay the following at the sale of the property or maturity date of the Restated Notes.
I-8
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
a. 75% of the amount by which the Economic Value of the Development as defined up to $100 million exceeds the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest under the Restated Notes, and
b. 50% of the Economic Value in excess of $100 million.
In general, the Economic Value is defined by the Restated Second Mortgage Note as the value of the Development as determined by the Partnership or the average of three independent appraisals if deemed necessary by BMC.
In 1996 and 1995, $150,000 was paid to BMC as 75% of remaining net cash flow for 1995 and 1994, respectively, and is included in net cash flow participation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Also in both 1996 and 1995, $50,000 was paid to CRCC as management fees for 1995 and 1994, respectively, and is included in management fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, $150,000 and $50,000 were accrued as of December 31, 1996 for fiscal year 1996 for net cash flow participation and management fees, respectively.
The Restated Second Mortgage Note is due on November 30, 2001 and no principal payments are required until then. However, any amounts remitted to BMC with respect to its 75% net cash flow participation described above may be re-advanced to BMCLP for payment of debt service on the Restated First Mortgage Note, repairs, capital improvements, leasing commissions, tenant concessions and improvements, taxes and ground lease payments. These advances are limited to 75% of the total amount required to fund these items. The remaining 25% must be funded by BMCLP. BMC has reserved the right, but does not have the obligation, to make up to $5 million in additional advances that would be secured under its Restated Second Mortgage Note. These additional advances would carry an interest rate of 18% payable from available net cash flow, as defined, and would also be due on November 30, 2001. As of December 31, 1996, no additional advances have been made.
BMC required that BMCLP deposit a deed in lieu of foreclosure in escrow to be recordable in the event of a default under the Restated Second Mortgage Note. CRCC agreed to amend and restate various no bankruptcy agreements of the type the original lender, Great Western, had required of it and certain affiliates. The new agreements are not secured or guaranteed, but a default thereunder could trigger the recordation of the escrowed deed in lieu of foreclosure. One event of default would occur if an entity other than CRCC became a General Partner of BMCLP (and could potentially put BMCLP in bankruptcy).
Additionally, under the terms of the Restated Second Mortgage Note, the Partnership received working capital reserves as proceeds in connection with the November 16, 1994 debt restructuring. These funds are held by BMC in an escrow account and can be used by BMCLP to fund any operating expenses by demonstrating the need for such funds to BMC. As of December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, balances in the escrow account totalled $273,654 and $738,654, respectively. On February 1, 1996 and April 5, 1996, BMC released $580,000 and $135,000, respectively, to BMCLP to fund costs of leasing and operating expenses. On July 31, 1996 and December 31, 1996, BMCLP deposited $50,000 and $200,000, respectively, to replenish the reserve. During 1995, BMCLP withdrew $400,000 from the escrow account to help pay the interest on the Restated Second Mortgage Note and deposited $100,000 to replenish the reserve.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
A purchase money mortgage had been placed upon the Development as of September 17, 1985 to secure repayment for the redemption by BMCLP of the partnership interest in BMCLP held by Iroquois Financial Corporation (Iroquois), a Maryland corporation, which is owned 50% by Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky and 50% by an individual unaffiliated with Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky or the General Partners. This purchase money mortgage (the Third Mortgage Note) was subordinated to the Second Mortgage Note as of July, 1987. The Third Mortgage Note collateralizes the payment by BMCLP of the $3,000,000 purchase money note given by BMCLP to Iroquois in exchange for Iroquois' interest in BMCLP. The Third Mortgage Note bears simple interest at 9%. In connection with the debt restructuring on November 16, 1994, the Third Mortgage Note was amended to provide that interest is due and payable annually only to the extent funds are available after taking into account payment of amounts due and payable on the Restated Notes and a payment of up to $50,000 per year to CRCC and/or the Partnership to cover costs of management and administration. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be deferred without interest and be paid, together with the outstanding principal balance of the Third Mortgage Note, upon the earliest of: (i) sale of the assets of BMCLP; (ii) refinancing of the Restated Notes for an amount in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal balances due thereunder; or (iii) one day later than the later of any Maturity Date under the Restated Notes. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, accrued interest of $3,049,500 and $2,779,500, respectively, has been added to the outstanding principal balance of $3,000,000 in accordance with the amended Third Mortgage Note. No net cash flow, as defined in the agreement, was available for repayment of this note during 1996, 1995 or 1994.
Substantially all of BMCLP's property and equipment is pledged as collateral to the Restated First and Second Mortgage Notes and to the Third Mortgage Note.
DEBT FORGIVENESS - ----------------
BMCLP's outstanding obligation under the First Restated Note prior to the restructuring was $178,373,753. The carrying amount of the outstanding principal and accrued interest that was forgiven based on the assignment and subsequent restatement of the First Mortgage Note is presented as deferred gain on debt forgiveness in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This amount is being amortized as an extraordinary gain over the remaining term of the Restated First Mortgage Note based on a constant effective yield as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15 (SFAS 15), "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings".
Based on the Restated First Mortgage Note s interest rate of 9.78% and 10.06% in effect at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and the monthly principal curtailments of $108,333 as stipulated in the Restated First Mortgage Note, the estimated total future obligation for principal and interest is $67,453,640 and $73,150,159 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, including additional draws subsequent to the restructuring. Although these obligations are lower than the combined obligations of the Restated First Mortgage Note and the deferred gain on debt forgiveness (which totalled $136,886,036 and $156,408,615 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively), SFAS 15 does not permit the entire difference to be recognized as an extraordinary gain at the time of the restructuring as the Restated First Mortgage Note s interest rate is variable, which makes the amount of future debt-service payments contingent upon changes in the index upon which the interest rate is calculated. Accordingly, the
I-10
PART I ------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Continued ----------
$69,432,396 and $83,258,456 difference between the carrying value and total future obligation of the debt at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, was deferred and is being amortized as an extraordinary gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest method over the term of the Restated First Mortgage Note.
As a result of the fluctuations of the interest rate on the Restated First Mortgage Note, the Partnership continues to remeasure the total future obligation for principal and interest based upon changes in the underlying index, as discussed above. Differences in the future obligation resulting from interest rate changes are reflected as a reclassification between the Restated First Mortgage Note and deferred gain on debt forgiveness. For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, $990,767 and $4,556,760, respectively, was reclassified from the deferred gain on debt forgiveness to the Restated First Mortgage Note resulting from an increase in the future obligation based on changes in the underlying index. The adjusted deferred gain on debt forgiveness will be amortized as extraordinary gain over the remaining term of the Restated First Mortgage Note.
For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, amortization of this deferred debt forgiveness amounted to $14,600,160, $14,085,175 and $1,852,734, respectively. The amortization of deferred gain is included in the extraordinary item of $14,340,300, $13,825,315 and $1,820,252 at December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, as it is shown net of the interest expense on the Restated Second Mortgage Note of $259,860, $259,860 and $32,482, respectively, as discussed below.
With regard to the Restated Second Mortgage Note, the total estimated future obligation for payment of principal and interest based on the fixed interest rate of 16% is $21,200,000. This amount exceeds the carrying value of the Restated Second Mortgage Note at November 16, 1994, of $19,380,974. In accordance with SFAS 15, this difference of $1,819,026 represents a constant additional interest obligation based on the fixed interest rate, and is to be amortized as a reduction of the extraordinary gain on the Restated First Mortgage Note at $21,655 per month through maturity, using the effective interest method, over the term of the Restated Second Mortgage Note. Accordingly, accrual of this additional interest for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $259,860 in each year and was added to the principal balance of the Restated Second Mortgage Note.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Investments" (SFAS 107), requires the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The Partnership has determined that the carrying amount of the total future obligation of the Restated First Mortgage Note, which represents the estimated total future obligation of principal and interest, approximates fair value based on the variable nature of the Restated First Mortgage Note's interest rate. Because future debt-service payments are contingent upon changes in the underlying index upon which the interest rate is calculated, the total future obligation of the Restated First Mortgage Note is expected to fluctuate with changing market rates of interest. The Partnership has determined that it is not practicable to estimate the fair value for the Restated Second Mortgage Note or the Third Mortgage Note due to: (1) the lack of an active market for these types of financial instruments, (2) the variable nature of the remaining net cash flow payments payable to BMC under the Restated
I-11

Second Mortgage Note, as discussed above, (3) the variable nature of the Third Mortgage Note's interest payments as a result of its dependence on available cash flow from BMCLP, and (4) the excessive costs associated with an independent appraisal of the Restated Second Mortgage Note and the Third Mortgage Note.
OPERATING DEFICIT OBLIGATION ----------------------------
For operating deficits which arise, the BMCLP Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) provides that Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky and their affiliates (collectively, R&K) are required to loan, or cause to be loaned, all amounts necessary to pay operating deficits (Operating Deficit Loans) up to an aggregate principal amount of $15,600,000. R&K and the Partnership have agreed that the former Second Mortgage Note of $10,000,000 was an Operating Deficit Loan "caused to be" made to BMCLP by R&K. Further, R&K's Operating Deficit Loan obligation limit of $15,600,000 was increased by (i) an amount equal to the net positive difference between the interest due and payable under the original terms of the First Mortgage Note and the interest due and payable under the original First Mortgage Note as a result of the third loan modification and (ii) the amount that interest accruing on the original Second Mortgage Note exceeded the interest that would have accrued had the loan been made directly by R&K. At December 31, 1996, BMCLP estimates that R&K's total operating deficit obligation has increased to approximately $29,000,000, although R&K do not concur with this amount. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, R&K have provided $2,367,168 and $2,243,984, respectively, including accrued interest, to BMCLP to fund operating deficits under this provision of the LPA. This amount is net of $342,734 which is due from the Alan I. Kay Companies, an affiliate of Alan I. Kay, for advances from BMCLP. Interest on amounts advanced to BMCLP for operating deficits is accrued at the prime rate plus 1% and will be repaid subject to the terms of the Restated Notes and then out of 50% of cash flow available after payment of certain priorities as set forth in the BMCLP partnership agreement. These Operating Deficit Loans shall be repaid in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) fifteen (15) years from the date of such loans or (ii) liquidation, sale or refinancing of the Development (except a refinancing which does not exceed the outstanding principal balance of the original First Mortgage Note).
The obligation of R&K to make or cause to be made Operating Deficit Loan(s) is jointly and severally guaranteed by Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky and further secured by the expense allowance payable to Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky, the Incentive Management Fee payable to Rozansky & Kay Construction Company, one-half (1/2) of the disposition fee payable to Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky from the proceeds of any sale of the Development, and any distributions made to Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky from the net cash flow of BMCLP or from the proceeds of any sale or refinancing of BMCLP. All obligations of Rozansky and Kay Construction Company have been assumed by Alan I. Kay and Allen E. Rozansky.
