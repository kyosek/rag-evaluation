ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2007, we had wholly owned interests in four malls encompassing approximately 2.5 million rentable square feet. Our portfolio also included ownership interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures encompassing approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet. The tables below set forth information with respect to these properties (square feet and annualized base rent in thousands).
Wholly Owned Properties
1)
In connection with their lease expiration, Dillard’s vacated their space at the Tallahassee Mall on January 31, 2008.
2)
During July 2007, we purchased the JCPenney anchor store at the Northgate Mall. JCPenney vacated the anchor store and we are presently redeveloping the site.
Joint Venture Properties
3)
Wal-Mart is a “shadow anchor” that is located on a separate land parcel adjacent to the Foothills Mall.
In the table above:
•
Total Square Feet includes Rentable Square Feet and the square feet occupied by nonowned anchor tenants.
•
Rentable Square Feet includes all owned square feet, including owned-anchor square feet.
•
Shop Tenant Square Feet consists of all Rentable Square Feet, less (a) anchor and junior anchor square feet, (b) all out parcel square feet, and (c) non-retail square feet.
•
Percentage Leased is calculated based on leases executed as of December 31, 2007 and includes owned anchor tenant space.
•
Shop Tenants Percentage Leased is calculated based on leases executed as of December 31, 2007 by shop tenants and non-anchor tenants. These figures exclude leases to tenants under temporary leases, which are leases for an initial term of less than one year.
•
Annualized Base Rent is calculated based on monthly base rent derived from 100% of our existing lease agreements executed as of December 31, 2007 and annualized for a 12-month period, except as set forth below. The Annualized Base Rent figures appearing in the table above are based on net rent, which means that the rent shown above does not include certain additional charges that are passed on to the tenants, including common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes. Annualized Base Rent does not include (a) any additional revenues from temporary or month-to-month tenants or tenants paying rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales, (b) lease-up of vacant space, (c) rental increases occurring after December 31, 2007 or (d) pass-through of operating expenses to tenants.
•
Shop Tenant Base Rent Per Leased Square Foot is calculated based on monthly base rent derived from shop tenant leases executed and in occupancy as of December 31, 2007 and annualized for a 12-month period, with the product divided by the rentable square feet leased to shop tenants as of such date.
•
Non-owned Anchor Tenants are anchor tenants of the mall, but we do not own their improvements or their underlying land and therefore we will not collect rent from these retailers. We refer to these retailers as non-owned anchor tenants. We believe non-owned anchor tenants are important to a property because the attractiveness of the anchor retailers at the property (whether or not we collect rent from them) may significantly affect the leasing of owned space and shop tenant sales at the property. Wal-Mart is a non-owned anchor tenant of the Foothills Mall and occupies and owns a super center consisting of approximately 210,000 square feet, which shares a common parking lot and entrance road with the Foothills Mall.
Tenant Diversification
We have approximately 500 leases, many of which are with nationally recognized retailers. The following table sets forth information regarding the 10 largest tenants in our portfolio (including wholly-owned and joint venture properties) based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2007.

Wholly Owned Properties
Stratford Square Mall
Overview
On December 30, 2004, we acquired Stratford Square Mall for a base purchase price of $93.1 million. We are investing an additional $46.8 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Stratford Square Mall, of which $37.8 million was incurred through December 31, 2007, for an estimated total project cost of approximately $139.9 million.
Stratford Square Mall is a 1.3 million square-foot, super-regional mall located in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Located in DuPage County, a northwestern suburb of Chicago, the mall has five non-owned anchor tenants: Kohl’s, Sears, Carson Pirie Scott (a unit of the Saks Department Store Group), Marshall Fields and Burlington Coat Factory. We have entered into an operating agreement with these five anchor tenants to share certain operating expenses based on allocated amounts per square foot. The agreements will terminate in March 2031. We acquired the sixth anchor location in 2006 which is leased to JCPenney.
The mall’s anchor tenants are complemented by nationally recognized retailers such as Forever 21, Abercrombie & Fitch, Pacific Sun, American Eagle, Claire’s, Bath & Body Works, The Children’s Place, The Gap, f.y.e., Limited Too and Victoria’s Secret. The shops are comprised of approximately 450,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court.
Renovation and Repositioning Plan
Our opportunity, with respect to Stratford Square, is to take advantage of the mall’s six anchor tenants to leverage the draw from such anchor tenants into higher shop sales. In addition, with approximately 123,000 square feet of shop space available, there is an opportunity to enhance the net operating income from this property through an ongoing leasing program. The following is an outline of our strategic plan to accomplish this goal:
•
New Movie Theatre Tenant. In July 2007, we opened a state-of-the-art, multi-screen cineplex, with Cinemark Theaters. Similar to our Foothills Mall property, the objective is to support the shop tenants with a movie theatre that is entered only through the interior of the mall. Over time, the plan contemplates that the theater will draw restaurant tenants to the mall. Pursuant to dispute provisions in our lease with Cinemark, we have entered into an arbitration proceeding related to cost responsibility pursuant to the completion of theater totaling approximately $1.0 million. In addition, we have taken action to collect delinquent rent in the amount of approximately $800,000. Pursuant to that action, Cinemark has commenced rent payments.
•
Redirecting Anchor Tenant Traffic. We are near completion of the renovations of the interior common areas and the mall entrances. The objective with respect to this renovation is to create a unique series of indoor mall features that will complement the mall’s attractive architecture.
•
Signage. We will improve the visibility of the mall by adding significantly upgraded signage, including a series of new pylon signs (subject to municipal approvals) that will be visible from nearby local roads.
•
Restaurants. We will focus a significant portion of our continuing leasing efforts towards tenants that are entertainment and tourist destinations, such as upscale and trendy restaurants and arcades.
We expect these renovation and repositioning efforts will help draw more shoppers into the mall, which we expect will increase the average sales per square foot of existing tenants and to encourage new tenants to lease space at the mall.
Financing
On May 8, 2007, we closed on a $104.5 million first mortgage refinancing of the Stratford Square Mall. The first mortgage has an initial term of 36 months and bears interest at 115 basis points over LIBOR. The loan has two one-year extension options. On the closing date, $78.2 million of the loan proceeds were used to retire the Stratford Square Mall’s two outstanding first mortgages. The balance of the proceeds was placed into escrow, pending completion of the redevelopment project. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $12.9 million remains available to be released from the escrow. We believe that the balance of the funds held in the escrow account will be sufficient to complete the redevelopment of this project.
Location and Demographics
Stratford Square is located in Bloomingdale, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The following are the key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit Stratford Square:
•
Population. The suburban Chicago population within a 15-mile radius of Stratford Square is approximately 2.0 million people according to Claritas.
•
Population Growth. The population within a 15-mile radius of Stratford Square is estimated to have grown by approximately 2.2% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by an additional 1.1% from 2007 to 2012 according to Claritas.
•

Tallahassee Mall
Overview
In June 2005, we acquired the Tallahassee Mall for a purchase price of $61.5 million. The purchase price consisted of the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of approximately $45.8 million plus cash in the amount of approximately $16.2 million. The property is subject to a long-term ground lease that expires in the year 2063 (assuming the exercise of an extension option).
In December 2005, we issued 369,375 shares of our common stock to an affiliate of Kimco Realty Corporation in connection with acquiring a long-term lease located at the Tallahassee Mall.
Tallahassee Mall is a 966,000 square-foot, super-regional mall serving Tallahassee, Florida and its surrounding areas. The Tallahassee Mall is anchored by four major tenants: AMC Theaters, Burlington Coat Factory and Belk’s. In addition, the mall has Old Navy, Sports Authority, Goody’s Family Clothing, Ross Dress for Less, Shoe Carnival and Barnes & Noble and junior anchor tenants. The mall’s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Victoria’s Secret and Express. The 85 shops comprise approximately 204,000 square feet and are accessed on one level, with a central food court, restaurants and cafés. One of our anchors, Dillard’s, did not renew its lease at the mall and vacated its space on January 31, 2008. We have not yet found a tenant to occupy this vacant space. As a result of this vacancy, certain tenant leases allow for them to pay lower rental income.
The city of Tallahassee is the state capital of Florida and is located in northwestern Florida, 20 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico and only 13 miles south of Georgia. The mall itself is located minutes from the center of the capital district, Interstate 10 and three college campuses with a combined population of 65,000 students: Florida State University, Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University and Tallahassee Community College. The population within a 10-mile radius has experienced a 7.7% increase from 2000 to 2006 and employment has consistently increased each year for all industry sectors.
Financing
The property is currently encumbered by a $45.9 million first mortgage. The mortgage bears interest at 8.6% and with an anticipated repayment date in July 2009. If we do not repay the loan by July 2009, the interest rate on this loan will be reset to the greater of (i) 8.6% plus 5% or (ii) the then current treasury rate plus 5% through the final maturity date in July 2029.
Renovation and Repositioning Plan
Our goal, with respect to the Tallahassee Mall, is to take advantage of the market’s unusually strong population growth and solid in-place tenant base. In addition, with approximately 35,000 square feet of vacant space available, there is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program. Our plan contemplates a renovation and repositioning plan for the Tallahassee Mall. The following is a preliminary outline of our strategic plan to accomplish this goal:
•
New Junior Anchor Tenants. We are currently targeting a number of potential anchor and/or junior anchor tenants to replace the recently vacated Dillard’s building.
•
Appearance. We intend to improve the appearance of the mall by undertaking major renovations of the interior common areas and the mall entrances.
The commencement of this redevelopment effort will, however, depend on our securing additional financing proceeds to re-tenant the vacant anchor space and complete the project. We do not anticipate securing additional financing proceeds and commencing our redevelopment plans until 2009.
Location and Demographics
The following are key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit the Tallahassee Mall:
•
Population. The Tallahassee metropolitan statistical area population within a 15-mile radius of the Tallahassee Mall is approximately 277,005 according to Claritas. This figure excludes a large and growing college population of 65,000 students.
•
Population Growth. The population within a 15-mile radius of the Tallahassee Mall is estimated to have grown by approximately 10% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by 9.8% from 2007 to 2012 according to Claritas.
•
Household Income. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average household income within a 15-mile radius of the Colonie Center was estimated to be $60,141 according to Claritas.
•
Local Market Characteristics. With stable growth and expansion in the area, the Tallahassee unemployment rates have remained relatively low at 5.6% in 2006. The unemployment rate’s stability is largely due to the state government work force as well as to high quality educational institutions and a stable community. This student population and stable government workforce provides a steady pool of consumers for area retailers.
Competition
The primary competitor of the Tallahassee Mall is:
•
Governor’s Square Mall. The Governor’s Square Mall is located in Tallahassee, approximately five miles from the Tallahassee Mall. Governor’s Square is on the Apalachee Parkway and is accessible from Highway
10 and Route 261. The anchor tenants include Macy’s, JCPenney, and Sears. Governor’s Square is a two-story super-regional mall totaling 1 million square feet. The mall’s occupancy is competitive, with a traditional middle market merchandising mix.

Northgate Mall
Overview
In July 2005, we acquired the Northgate Mall (“Northgate”) for a purchase price of $110.0 million. The purchase price consisted of the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of $79.6 million and $30.4 million of cash. We also plan to invest an additional $18.4 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Northgate, of which $13.2 million was incurred through December 31, 2007, for an estimated total project cost of $128.4 million.
Northgate is an enclosed single-level, three-anchor, super-regional mall with a total gross leasable area (“GLA”) of approximately 1.1 million square feet of which 577,000 square feet are owned by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (including approximately 84,000 square feet of free-standing retail space). We own the Macy’s anchor store. Northgate is anchored by Dillard’s, Macy’s and Sears and has a mix of national in-line tenants, including American Eagle, Aeropostale, The Children’s Place, Finish Line, The Disney Store, Express, Victoria’s Secret and Zales. Northgate also has outparcels that are occupied by Borders Books, TGI Friday’s and Burger King. Northgate opened in 1972 and was expanded in 1993 as part of a $50 million expansion/renovation.
In July 2007, we acquired the building occupied by JCPenney and related acreage for a purchase price of $2.0 million. JCPenney has vacated and we have demolished the building. On October 9, 2007, we entered into a lease with a prospective tenant to develop a stadium-seating movie theater on this parcel. However, we have been unable to finalize a construction plan and budget with this tenant for this project. On March 31, 2008, we sent a termination notice to this tenant and are currently evaluating our options for this space.
Financing
The property is currently secured by a first mortgage with a balance at December 31, 2007 of $77.1 million. The first mortgage bears interest at 6.6% and has an anticipated repayment date in September 2012. We may refinance the mortgage on or before 2012. We also may elect to defease the debt prior to the final maturity date in 2032.
Renovation and Repositioning Plan
Our long-term goal, with respect to the Northgate Mall, is to build on the mall’s anchor tenant mix to enhance increase shop tenant sales. In addition, with approximately 35,000 square feet of vacant shop space available, there
is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program. The following is a preliminary outline of our strategic plan to accomplish this goal:
•
New Upscale Junior Anchor Tenants. Discussions have begun with junior anchor tenants, whose use and shopper appeal is ideally suited to the repositioning plan.
•
Appearance. A new lifestyle “streetscape area” is being planned for the mall’s exterior facing Colerain Avenue. Additional retailers will be added along this streetscape with a multi-million dollar upgrade to the mall’s main entrance, streetscape sidewalks, lighting and facades. This will enhance the overall appearance and will help attract marquee tenants which will have the ability to have frontage along Colerain Avenue. We also intend to improve the appearance of the mall by undertaking major renovations of the interior common areas and the mall entrances.
•
Signage. We will improve the visibility of the mall by adding significantly upgraded signage.
We expect these renovation and repositioning efforts will impact the financial performance of the Northgate Mall. We expect our revenues to grow as more shoppers spend more time in the mall, which we expect will increase shop tenant sales per square foot. The overall objective will be to convert this mall from a Class B mall to a Class A or near Class A mall. We are currently seeking financing to commence our redevelopment project, however we do not anticipate securing the financing and commencing the redevelopment during 2008.
Location and Demographics
Northgate is located in the northwest Cincinnati suburbs and benefits from the residential and business development occurring in its trade area. Northgate is located on Colerain Avenue, less than one mile south of I-275, the primary highway serving the metropolitan Cincinnati area. Colerain Township is a densely populated suburb of the Cincinnati city limits which is 10 miles to the south.
The following are key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit the Northgate Mall:
•

Additional retail competition totals an additional 2.4 million square feet, including one power center. Competitors of Northgate include:
•
Tri-County Mall. The 1.3 million square-foot, two-level regional mall is located approximately nine miles to the east along I-275. Tri-County’s primary trade area is the area immediately north and east along I-275. The mall is anchored by Macy’s, Dillard’s and Sears and includes traditional mall tenants that focus on the mid-price point.
•
Cincinnati Mills. The two-level, 1.5 million square-foot big box, entertainment and lifestyle center opened in August 2004. The property is located approximately six miles east of Northgate Mall, in Fairfield, and has Bass Pro Shops, Baby’s ‘R Us, Bigg’s, Kohl’s, Saks Off 5th, Showcase Cinemas (10-screen theater) and Media Play.

Golden Triangle Mall
Overview
On April 5, 2006, we acquired the Golden Triangle Mall (“Golden Triangle”) for a base purchase price of $40.2 million. The purchase price was subsequently increased by $2.1 million, in accordance with the purchase agreement, as the seller was able to complete the opening of a Hollister store (unit of Abercrombie and Fitch) in January 2007. We plan to fund an additional investment in the renovation and repositioning plan for Golden Triangle Mall.
Golden Triangle is a 765,000 square-foot, super-regional mall located in Denton, Texas. Located in Denton County, a northern suburb of Dallas. The mall has four non-owned anchor tenants - Macy’s, Dillard’s, JC Penney and Sears - and three junior anchors, which are DSW, Ross and Barnes & Noble. The mall’s anchor and junior anchor tenants are complemented by nationally recognized retailers such as Victoria’s Secret, American Eagle Outfitters, Hollister, Pacific Coast Sun Wear and Bath & Body Works. The shops are comprised of approximately 252,000 square feet and are accessed on one level.
As previously reported, two anchor tenants at the Golden Triangle Mall, Dillard’s and JCPenney, have signed letters of intent to relocate to a new competitive life style center known as Rayzor Ranch, which may be located
approximately five miles north of the property. If Rayzor Ranch is built, we believe the anchors may move in 2010. We are assessing our options with regard to this property in light of these developments.
Renovation and Repositioning Plan
Our opportunity, with respect to Golden Triangle, is to take advantage of the trade area’s unusually strong growth in order to attract new anchors and key shop tenants. Ultimately, the plan is to increase occupancy and drive up shop sales. In addition, with approximately 151,000 square feet of shop space available, there is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program. The following is a preliminary outline of our strategic plan to accomplish this goal.
We expect that our renovation and repositioning efforts will impact the financial performance of Golden Triangle by drawing the anchor tenant shoppers into the main mall and attracting more shoppers. By combining an entertainment theme including numerous restaurants and the existing Barnes & Noble, we expect our shop tenant revenues to grow as more shoppers spend more time in the main mall, which we expect will increase shop tenant sales per square foot. The overall objective will be to convert this mall from a Class B mall to a Class A or near Class A mall.
Financing
On April 5, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of the Golden Triangle Mall, we entered into a $24.6 million secured line of credit (the “line”). On April 20, 2007, we increased the line from $24.6 million, to $30.0 million. The maturity date of the line is April 2009 and up to $5.5 million of the line is recourse to us. The line contains customary covenants that require us to, among other things, maintain certain financial coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2007, we were not in compliance with a quarterly debt coverage constant of 10.50%. We are currently negotiating a waiver of this covenant; however, if we are unable to obtain a waiver, we would be required to reduce the current outstanding balance by $1.0 million.
Loan draws and repayments are at our option. Interest is payable monthly at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.40% to 2.00% or, at our option, the prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to 0.25%. The applicable margins depend on our debt coverage ratio as specified in the loan agreement. Commitment fees are paid monthly at the rate of 0.125% to 0.25% of the average unused borrowing capacity.
In October 2006, we entered into a modification agreement that provides for the issuance of letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $13.0 million for a fee of 0.5% of the face amount. As of December 31, 2007, letters of credit outstanding under this agreement amounted to $10.25 million and are renewable through the maturity date of the line.
The outstanding balance on the line as of December 31, 2007 was $17.5 million with interest rates on the tranches ranging from 6.59% to 7.25%.
Location and Demographics
Golden Triangle is located in Denton, Texas, which is in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area. The following are the key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit Golden Triangle:
•
Population. The suburban Dallas population within a 15-mile radius of Golden Triangle is approximately 446,370 people according to Claritas.
•
Population Growth. The population within a 15-mile radius of Golden Triangle is estimated to have grown by approximately 38.3% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by an additional 19.3% from 2007 to 2012 according to Claritas.
•
Household Income. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average household income within a 15-mile radius of Golden Triangle was estimated to be $84,831 according to Claritas.
•
Local Market Characteristics. Dallas represents the tenth largest metropolitan area in the nation and the third largest in the south behind Houston and Atlanta. The combined Dallas/Fort Worth area, or “Metroplex,” encompasses a population of more than 5.7 million people. Migration in the Metroplex continues to spread increasingly northward, resulting in tremendous population gains in the county and city of Denton.
Dallas is a major site for high-income employment sectors such as professional and business services, financial services and high-technology industries. Together these high wage-earning industries are expected to continue to drive the area’s economic growth over the next five years. Dallas benefits from a labor force that is skilled, educated and dependable and from a relatively affordable housing market.
Competition
The Golden Triangle Mall has several competitors, which include the following:
•
Vista Ridge Mall is located 14 miles southeast of Golden Triangle in Lewisville and consists of 1.1 million square feet of total gross leasable area and is home to 168 stores. Categorized as a super-regional mall, Vista Ridge Mall is larger in size than Golden Triangle, but shares a similar in-line tenant mix and has four anchor tenants in common with Golden Triangle - Dillard’s, Foley’s, JCPenney and Sears. Built in 1989 and remodeled in 1991, Vista Ridge Mall represents primary competition to Golden Triangle due to its in-line tenant mix and anchor stores.
•
Stonebriar Centre is located approximately 18 miles southeast of the Golden Triangle in the City of Frisco. The two-story super-regional mall opened in 2000. Stonebriar Centre is more than double the size of Golden Triangle, consisting of 1.6 million square feet of total GLA and more than 525,000 square feet of in-line GLA. Stonebriar Centre includes 163 traditional and upscale in-line tenants such as Chico’s, Coach, J. Crew, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. Stonebriar Centre is anchored by Foley’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus and Sears and includes an AMC Theatre. Due to the mall’s shared anchors and relative location, Stonebriar Centre represents primary competition for the Golden Triangle; Stonebriar Centre’s distance and more upscale tenancy make the mall comparatively less competitive with Golden Triangle.
•
Denton Crossing is a 488,000 square-foot power center located one mile northeast of Golden Triangle off of Loop 288. Opened in 2004, Denton Crossing includes such national big-box tenants as Bed, Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Kroger Supermarket, Michael’s, Pier 1 Imports, T.J. Maxx and Walgreens. Because of Denton Crossing’s big-box tenant mix, the power center does not represent primary competition to Golden Triangle. Denton Crossing’s close proximity to Golden Triangle bodes well for both retail centers, which together create a synergy of retail offerings along the Loop 288 corridor.
•
The Shops at Circle T Ranch is scheduled for completion in 2008 and will be located 14 miles southwest of Golden Triangle in the City of Westlake. This super-regional mall will include 1.3 million square feet of total GLA and while in-line tenants have yet to be determined, the mall is set to be anchored by Dillard’s, Foley’s and AMC Theatres. Upon completion, The Shops at Circle T Ranch will serve as primary competition to Golden Triangle due to shared anchor tenants and relative proximity to Golden Triangle.
•
Grapevine Mills is located 20 miles south of Golden Triangle and just two miles from the Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport and serves as a major retail and entertainment destination for residents and tourists visiting the Dallas metro area. Grapevine Mills includes a unique tenant mix of specialty stores (Virgin Megastore), outlets (Neiman Marcus, Saks), manufacturer stores, (Burlington Coat Factory), entertainment (ESPN X Games Skate Park) and themed restaurants (Rainforest Café). Opened in 1997, Grapevine Mills serves as secondary competition to Golden Triangle due to its unique tenant mix and geographical distance from Golden Triangle.

Joint Venture Properties
Foothills Mall
Overview
The Foothills Mall is located in the suburbs of Tucson, Arizona and is a single level, enclosed regional mall containing approximately 711,000 square feet originally built in 1983. In addition, Wal-Mart occupies and owns a 210,000 square-foot super center that shares a common parking lot and road entrance with the Foothills Mall. The Foothills Mall is anchored by a series of “big box” anchor tenants, including Barnes & Noble, Linens ’N Things, a Loews/AMC Cineplex 15-screen stadium theatre, Ross Dress For Less, Old Navy, Saks Off 5th and a large Nike Factory Outlet store. In addition, we have entered into a 15,000 square-foot lease with Sega World Sports Bar and Grill, which is expected to take occupancy in the second quarter of 2008. The Foothills Mall’s specialty stores include Bath & Body Works, Claire’s, Haggar, Levi’s, PacSun, Quiksilver, Samsonite and Sunglass Hut. In addition, the Foothills Mall includes numerous restaurants such as Applebee’s, Gavi Italian Restaurant, Keatons Restaurant, Melting Pot, Outback Steakhouse and Thunder Canyon Brewery.
On June 26, 2006, we contributed the Foothills Mall to a joint venture with a subsidiary of Kimco at an agreed value of $104 million, plus certain closing costs (the “Foothills JV”). We accounted for the transaction as a partial sale of real estate, which resulted in us recognizing a gain of $29.4 million. Pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement, we received approximately $38.9 million in net proceeds from the transaction.
Simultaneous with the formation of the joint venture, Kimco contributed cash in the amount of $14.8 million to the Foothills JV. Kimco will receive a preferred return of 8.0% on its capital from the Foothills Mall’s cash flow. Kimco may be required to make additional capital contributions to the Foothills JV for additional tenant improvements and leasing commissions, as defined in the limited liability company agreement, which in the aggregate shall not exceed $2 million. Upon the first to occur of a sale of the property or June 2010, Kimco will make an additional capital contribution to the Foothills JV in an amount equal to the unfunded portion (if any), which will be distributed to us. Upon a sale or refinancing of the Foothills Mall, Kimco is also entitled to receive a priority return of its capital together with any unpaid accrued preferred return. After certain adjustments, we are next entitled to receive an 8% preferred return on and a return of capital. Thereafter, all surplus proceeds will be split 20% to Kimco and 80% to us. Additionally, we agreed to serve as the managing member of the Foothills JV and will retain primary management, leasing and construction oversight, for which we will receive customary fees. We have determined that the Foothills JV is not a variable interest entity and account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method. The Foothills JV agreement includes “buy-sell” provisions commencing in June 2008 for us and after May 2010 allowing either Foothills JV partner to acquire the interests of the other. Either partner to the Foothills JV may initiate a “buy-sell” proceeding, which may enable it to acquire the interests of the other partner. However, the partner receiving an offer to be bought out will have the right to buy out such offering partner at the same price offered. The Foothills JV agreement does not limit our ability to enter into real estate ventures or co-investments with other third parties.
In connection with the formation transactions, we entered into agreements with Messrs. Feldman, Bourg and Jensen that indemnify them with respect to certain tax liabilities intended to be deferred in the formation transactions, if those liabilities are triggered either as a result of a taxable disposition of a property (Harrisburg Mall or Foothills Mall) by our company, or if we fail to offer the opportunity for the contributors to guarantee or otherwise bear the risk of loss, with respect to certain amounts of our debt for tax purposes (the “contributor-guaranteed debt”). With respect to tax liabilities arising out of property sales, the indemnity will cover 100% of any such liability (approximately $5.2 million at December 31, 2007) until December 31, 2009 and will be reduced by 20% of the aggregate liability on each of the five following year-ends thereafter.
Renovation and Repositioning
We have substantially completed the renovation and repositioning project for the Foothills Mall.
Financing
On the closing date, the Foothills JV extinguished the existing first mortgage loan totaling $54.75 million and refinanced the property with an $81.0 million non-recourse first mortgage loan. The $81.0 million first mortgage loan matures in July 2016 and bears interest at 6.08%. The loan may not be prepaid until the earlier of three years from the first interest payment or two years from date of loan syndication and has no principal payments for the first five years and then loan principal amortizes on a 30-year basis thereafter.
Location and Demographics
The Foothills Mall is located in the greater Tucson, Arizona market and is near a busy thoroughfare which makes it accessible to significant local and tourist traffic. The following are key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit the Foothills Mall:
•
Population. Tucson is Arizona’s second largest city with a metropolitan statistical area population of 843,746, according to the US Census Bureau Census 2000.
•
Population Growth. Tucson is estimated to be one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. The population within a 15-mile radius of the Foothills Mall is estimated to have grown by 10.6% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by 8.5% from 2007 to 2011, according to Claritas.
•
Household Income. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average household income within a 15-mile radius of the Foothills Mall was estimated to be $58,222, according to Claritas.
•
Local Market Characteristics. The mall is located in a market that continues to experience positive growth trends.
Competition
The primary competitors of the Foothills Mall include three regional malls described below that jointly comprise approximately 3.5 million square feet of shop space. Seven power centers that comprise approximately 2.5 million square feet are located within ten miles of the property. Tucson’s expanding economy, tourism and strong population growth have created a strong retail market, including the regional mall sector. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for retail property in the Tucson area as evidenced by a 90% occupancy level for shop space. We expect the construction of new retail properties to increase modestly and in proportion to demand so that vacancy levels remain low. We believe the Foothills Mall is the only value and entertainment oriented mall in its trade area. Competitors of the Foothills Mall include:
•
El Con Mall. The El Con Mall is a 1.2 million square-foot mall and is located approximately 12 miles southeast of the Foothills Mall. The mall was originally built in 1962 and partially renovated in 1996. It has a 20-screen Century Theatre and a Home Depot and is seeking to add an additional discount retailer. Existing anchor tenants include JCPenney and Macy’s.
•
Park Place Mall. The Park Place Mall is a single level enclosed mall, which contains approximately 1.0 million square feet and is located 12 miles from the Foothills Mall. It is approximately 97% occupied and
is anchored by Dillard’s, Macy’s and Sears. Other tenants in the mall include Borders Books, Century Theatre and Old Navy. This mall recently completed a renovation process, which included the addition of “street” retailers, a food court, mall shops, restaurants, theatres and a new Dillard’s.
•
Tucson Mall. The Tucson Mall is a 1.3 million square-foot mall that has been considered the dominant mall in Tucson for nearly 20 years. The property is located approximately five miles southeast of the Foothills Mall. This mall was constructed in 1982 and renovated in 1991. Dillard’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, Mervyns and Sears are the anchor tenants.
•
La Encantada. La Encantada is a 258,000 square-foot mall located approximately 13 miles from Foothills. The mall opened in November 2003. It is an open air lifestyle center featuring upscale shops. Its anchor tenants are AJ’s Fine Foods, Crate & Barrel and Pottery Barn.

Colonie Center
Overview
In February 2005, we acquired the Colonie Center Mall for a base purchase price of $82.2 million. We paid additional consideration of $2.4 million in connection with the execution of certain pending leases that increased the purchase price to $84.6 million. We have nearly completed a $110 million renovation and repositioning plan for Colonie Center, of which we incurred $92.8 million through December 31, 2007, for an estimated total project cost of $192 million.
Colonie Center is a 1.2 million square-foot, super-regional mall serving Albany, New York and its surrounding areas. Colonie Center is anchored by four major department stores: Macy’s, Sears, Boscov’s and Christmas Tree Shops (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond). The mall’s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Bath & Body Works, The Children’s Place, Steve & Barry’s The Gap, Limited Too and Victoria’s Secret. The 110 shops are comprised of approximately 381,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court, restaurants and cafés.
Joint Venture with Heitman
On September 29, 2006, we completed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Heitman LLC (“Heitman”) in connection with the Colonie Center Mall whereby we entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Heitman. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, we contributed the mall to FMP Colonie LLC, a new Delaware limited liability company. Heitman’s contribution to the venture was approximately $47 million in order to purchase approximately 75% of the equity in Colonie Center. Our contribution to the venture was valued at approximately $15 million, representing approximately 25% of the equity in Colonie Center. In addition, we have made preferred capital contributions of approximately $10.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and subsequently have made additional contributions totaling $6.8 million that were used
primarily to fund construction costs. We have also agreed to a cost guarantee related to certain “hard” redevelopment costs of the property’s redevelopment project totaling $56.0 million. To the extent these costs exceed $56.0 million, our preferred equity contributions will be recharacterized as subordinated capital contributions. We estimate that this project will experience approximately $15 million of hard cost overruns. We have secured the balance of these cost overruns with a $10.25 million letter of credit drawn from our line of credit which is secured by our ownership of the Golden Triangle Mall. These subordinated equity contributions may not be distributed to us until Heitman receives a 15% return on and return of its invested equity capital.
The LLC Agreement between us and Heitman allows a buy-sell process to be initiated by us at any time on or after January 30, 2010 or by Heitman, at any time on or after November 1, 2010. There are additional provisions regarding disputes, defaults and change in management that allow Heitman to initiate a buy-sell process. The member initiating the buy-sell must specify a total purchase price for the property and the amount of the purchase price that would be distributed to each of the two members, with the allocation of the total purchase price being subject to arbitration if the parties disagree. The member receiving the buy-sell notice must elect within 60 days to either allow the initiating member to purchase the recipient’s interest in the Colonie JV for the price stated in the notice or to purchase the initiating member’s interest in the joint venture.
Financing
In June 2005, we completed a $50.8 million first mortgage bridge financing collateralized by the Colonie Center Mall. Subsequently, in September 2006, we refinanced the bridge loan with a new construction loan that currently has a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $116.3 million and matures in October 2008. A portion of this loan, in the amount of $50.8 million, has a fixed interest rate of 6.84%. The rate on the balance of this loan is floating at 180 basis points over LIBOR. The loan may be extended beyond October 2008, subject to satisfaction of certain financial covenants and other customary requirements for up to two additional years. The loan requires that we maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio during the initial term of the loan and, if we fail to meet the required ratio, cash flow to us is restricted. As of December 31, 2007, we did not meet the debt service coverage ratio and certain cash flow is currently unavailable, however if and when we satisfy the ratio, the cash flow will be released to us. Based upon the mall’s current performance, we do not believe these financial covenants will be satisfied and therefore we will not satisfy the conditions to extend the loan. We will attempt to negotiate a modification or waiver of the covenants and loan extension with the current lender prior to the maturity date. We continue to manage the property and receive customary management, construction and leasing fees in accordance with our joint venture agreement with Heitman.
Renovation and Repositioning Plan
We are putting the finishing touches on the new movie theater for Colonie Center and upon completion of this part of the project our redevelopment project for this mall will be substantially complete. The following is an outline of our strategic plan for this mall:
•
Redirecting Anchor Tenant Traffic. We improved the appearance and ambiance of the mall by undertaking major renovations of the interior common areas and the mall entrances. We added a unique series of indoor mall features, including a series of high-end Adirondack themed living rooms complete with a stone clad fire place area, fountain area, comfortable leather sofa seating, television viewing areas with modern full size flat screen televisions and a large scale, high-end children’s play area. In addition, indoor and outdoor restaurant seating are opening throughout the mall.
•
Appearance. We have improved the appearance of the mall by completing major renovations of the interior common areas and the mall entrances
•
Theater. We expect to open a 13-screen stadium-seating movie theater in May 2008.
We expect these renovation and repositioning efforts will ultimately impact the financial performance of Colonie Center by drawing more affluent shoppers to the mall. We expect our revenues to grow as more shoppers spend more time in the main mall, which we expect will increase shop tenant sales per square foot.
Location and Demographics
Colonie Center is located in the greater Albany, New York area adjacent to major thoroughfares including Interstate 87. The following are key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit Colonie Center:
•
Population. The Albany metropolitan statistical area population within a 20-mile radius of Colonie Center is approximately 875,000 according to the US Census Bureau 2000.
•
Population Growth. The population within a 15-mile radius of Colonie Center is estimated to have grown by approximately 2.5% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by 1.3% from 2007 to 2012 according to Claritas.
•
Household Income. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average household income within a 15-mile radius of the Colonie Center was estimated to be $66,050 according to Claritas.
•
Local Market Characteristics. The Albany region is home to a growing state government workforce, which tends to insulate the region from major economic downturns. In the next decade, the number of government employees is expected to increase, due to fiscal stimulus packages, which will have a positive impact on the Albany area. In addition, the region is home to 21 colleges with over 65,000 students. This student population and stable government workforce provides a steady pool of consumers for area retailers.
Competition
The primary competitors of Colonie Center include three regional malls described below that comprise approximately 3.2 million square feet of shop space. Four power centers that comprise approximately 2.2 million square feet are located within five miles of the property. With four established anchor tenants, two unique junior anchor tenants and a well-balanced mix of shop tenants, Colonie Center is one of the dominant, super-regional malls in its trade area. Competitors of Colonie Center include:
•
Crossgates Mall. The Crossgates Mall, located three miles south on Interstate 87, is Colonie Center’s closest and strongest competitor. The property was originally built in 1984 and underwent a renovation in 1994. It is the largest mall in the Albany region with over 1.6 million square feet and is anchored by Cohoes, Filene’s, H&M, JCPenney, Lord & Taylor and Macy’s. Other tenants in the mall include Best Buy, DSW Shoe Warehouse, a 30-screen Hoyt’s Cinemas, The Gap, Hollister, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. This mall has a large food court and much of its tenant mix is targeted toward teenagers.
•
Latham Circle Mall. The Latham Circle Mall is located four miles northeast of Colonie Center. The property was built in 1957 and renovated in 1994 and contains 677,000 square feet. It is anchored by Burlington Coat Factory, JCPenney, Klein’s and includes other major retailers such as Baby Depot and Malt River Brewing Company.
•
Clifton Park Center. Clifton Park Center is an 875,000 square-foot regional mall located 15 miles northwest of Colonie Center. The property was constructed in 1976 and was renovated in 2001. It is anchored by Boscov’s, JCPenney and Mega Marshall’s and includes a food court, day spa and a six-screen Hoyt’s Cinemas.

Harrisburg Mall
Overview
The Harrisburg Mall is located in Swatara Township, three miles from downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The property was originally built in 1969 and is a two-story, enclosed, regional mall containing 922,000 square feet. It is the largest mall in the Harrisburg market and has approximately 83 shop spaces. It is anchored by three large anchor tenants: Bass Pro Shops, Boscov’s and Macy’s. The Harrisburg Mall’s specialty shop tenants include Disney Store, Foot Locker, The Limited and Victoria’s Secret. In addition, the Harrisburg Mall has a food court that includes such national tenants as Arby’s, Cosimos Pizza and McDonald’s.
Renovation and Repositioning
The Phase II renovation of this property is targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of 2008. The plan includes the addition of upscale restaurants on the exterior of the mall in order to create a streetscape look and feel for the property, as well as the construction of a new movie theater (which has been completed) and up to two large “big-box” junior anchor tenants. We estimate the costs of these renovations will total $36.8 million, of which we incurred $24.4 million through December 31, 2007. The total renovation and repositioning plan for this mall, which is designed to convert the mall from a Class C mall to a Class A mall, includes the following:
•
Anchors and Key Renewals. Our predecessor signed two new long-term leases and renewed a third lease with proven high traffic anchor tenants. Bass Pro Shops occupies a 200,000 square-foot super store consisting of fishing, hunting and boating products. Our predecessor also signed a long-term lease with Boscov’s, a regional discount department store chain with approximately 40 stores. In addition, the May Company, which merged with Federated Department Stores, renewed its long-term lease through the year 2024. All three anchor tenants have agreed to operate their stores continuously for an extended period.
•
Entertainment. We have focused a significant portion of our leasing efforts towards leasing to tenants that are entertainment and tourist destinations, such as Bass Pro Shops and a movie theater. The Bass Pro Shops store opened on November 18, 2004 and is our most important anchor tenant in the Harrisburg Mall, serving both as a retailer and as an entertainment destination. At approximately 200,000 square feet, the Bass Pro Shops Harrisburg store is the second largest Bass Pro Shops store in the nation and features a 60,000-gallon aquarium, rock climbing walls, a live trout stream, waterfalls and an indoor archery range. During 2006, a lease was signed with the Great Escape movie theater chain for a 14-screen state of the art stadium seated movie theater. Construction of the theater is complete and the theater opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2007.
•
Accessibility. We improved the mall’s access by arranging for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to provide a direct exit ramp to the property from Interstate 83.
•
Appearance. We are improving the appearance of the mall by undertaking major renovations of the interior of the two new anchor stores, the interior and exterior of the mall and mall entrances.
•
Signage. We have improved visibility of the mall by adding significantly upgraded signage, including a 150-foot pylon sign which is visible from Interstate 83 and nearby local roads. In addition, we have installed a digital color video screen at the entrance to the mall. The digital color video screen is programmable from a computer inside our mall management office and will be available to notify the public about special events and other mall promotions. Working in collaboration with local officials, our predecessor succeeded in adding “Bass Pro Drive” to the name of a nearby local street, which will allow us to identify the retailer on multiple sign locations along Interstate 83.
•
Lighting and Security. We have improved lighting and security by installing brighter energy-efficient lighting and increasing security in parking lots with regular patrols.
•
Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning. We are reducing operating expenses by replacing the main air conditioning central plant with new modern energy efficient units that we estimate will result in a significant reduction in the cost of energy.
As a result of our renovation and repositioning efforts at the Harrisburg Mall, leased square footage will have grown from 850,000 to 995,000 as of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to executed anchor leases as of such date. Given the attractiveness of the new anchor tenants at the Harrisburg Mall and the next phase of renovation projected to be completed in 2008, additional revenue growth from the property is expected as occupancy levels and rental rates rise above current levels.
One of our tenants at this property, Panera Bread, which has executed a new lease to cover approximately 4,200 square feet of newly developed restaurant space, has notified us that it is considering sub-letting this space to another retailer. Under its lease, Panera Bread has the right to sublet this space, subject to our reasonable approval. The subletting of this space could delay the opening of the restaurant that will ultimately occupy this space. Under the lease with Barnes & Noble at this property, a delay in the opening of a suitable restaurant in the Panera Bread location could result in Barnes & Noble exercising its right under its lease to convert its fixed rate rent into a percentage rent formula and ultimately could give this tenant the right to terminate its lease at this property. We are in the process of assessing our options with regard to this space in the event that Panera Bread moves forward with its sub-let plan.
Joint Venture and Financing
In September 2003, our predecessor acquired an ownership interest in the Harrisburg Mall through Feldman Lubert Adler Harrisburg LP, a joint venture with affiliates of the Lubert Adler Funds based in Philadelphia. The joint venture paid $17.5 million, or approximately $20.00 per square foot, for the property, which was financed through both equity capital and a loan. Our joint venture partner provided approximately $10.8 million, or 75%, of the equity capital and our predecessor provided approximately $3.6 million, or 25%, of the equity capital. The remaining $3.1 million of the purchase price was financed through a construction loan with Commerce Bank.
As of December 31, 2007, the joint venture had spent approximately $62.1 million (net of government grant funding) on the renovation and repositioning of this property and we estimate that the total additional investment required to renovate and reposition the property is approximately $12.4 million. The joint venture intends to fund the additional $12.4 million investment from additional partner contributions and cash flow from operations.
The construction loan with Commerce Bank contained an initial maximum funding commitment of $46.9 million. During July 2005, the loan was amended and the commitment increased to $50 million with no principal payments due until the maturity date in March 2008. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.625% per annum. During July 2005, the borrowings were increased to $49.8 million and a distribution of $6.5 million was made to the partners on a pro rata basis of which we received $1.625 million. We extended the loan through April 14, 2008 at a borrowing rate of 200 basis points over LIBOR. We plan to extend the loan through December 31, 2009 at the same borrowing rate. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to extend the loan for this period or at this rate.
This loan presently has a limited recourse of $5.0 million, of which affiliates of the Lubert Adler Funds are liable for $3.2 million, or 63% and we are liable for $1.8 million, or 37%. In addition, pursuant to the terms of this loan, at any time the joint venture is entitled to receive a loan advance, the lender shall reduce the amount of such advance by the amount of the joint venture’s net cash flow after operating expenses and debt service.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of Feldman Lubert Adler Harrisburg LP, the general partner (one of our wholly owned subsidiaries) manages the day-to-day operations of the property. The general partner and limited partners share equally in decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the property, including property sales and financings, leasing and budget approval and amendments.
We and our joint venture partner each have the right to receive on a pro rata basis the operating cash flow of the property equal to 12%, computed on an annual compounded basis, on invested capital. Once operating cash
flow exceeds 12%, we will be entitled to receive an additional 20% of the excess cash flow. Upon a sale of the property and after both partners receive a return of their capital contributions to the joint venture (an aggregate of approximately $27.4 million as of December 31, 2007) plus a 12% cumulative, compounded return thereon, we will have the right to receive an additional 20% of the available cash, if any, plus our 25% share of the remaining 80% interest. In addition, in the event that a sale of the property produces an overall return in excess of 20% to our joint venture partner, we will be entitled to a 30% share of such excess, if any, plus our 25% share of the remaining 70% interest. To the extent that the partners are required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture, the amount of the 12% preferred return, which operating cash flow must exceed in order for the partners to receive the additional 20% of excess cash flow, will increase.
Under the terms of the joint venture, we are generally responsible for funding 25% of the capital contributions required for the venture. As of December 31, 2007, we had funded $10.6 million and our joint venture partner $16.8 million of the capital contributions made to the joint venture. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that completion of the redevelopment project for this property will require total additional capital contributions of approximately $12.4 million. We are currently attempting to resolve a dispute with our joint venture partner relating to the scope of the redevelopment plan for this project. Our joint venture partner has notified us that it believes that certain aspects of the last phase of the development plan were not approved in accordance with the joint venture agreement and as a result has claimed that we are responsible for 100% of the funding required for this part of the project. We are continuing to negotiate with our joint venture partner relating to this dispute and are seeking to develop a mutually acceptable solution for this issue. Through December 31, 2007, we have funded $4.0 million above our 25% capital contribution requirement for these redevelopment projects.
The contribution, merger and related agreements further provide that Feldman Partners, LLC (an entity controlled by Larry Feldman and owned by him and his family), Jim Bourg and Scott Jensen will receive additional OP units relating to the performance of the joint venture that owns the Harrisburg Mall. The aggregate value of the additional OP units that may be issued with respect to the Harrisburg Mall is equal to 50% of the amount, if any, that the internal rate of return achieved by us from the joint venture exceeds 15% on our investment on or prior to December 31, 2009. The estimated fair value of these additional OP units was zero at December 31, 2007.
The fees we are entitled to earn as manager of the Harrisburg Mall include a management fee of 3.5% of annual gross revenues paid monthly, a construction management fee of 3% of the amount of capital improvements and customary leasing fees for a mall leasing agent.
The joint venture agreement includes a “buy-sell” provision allowing either joint venture partner to acquire the interests of the other beginning on September 30, 2005. Either partner to the joint venture may initiate a “buy-sell” proceeding, which may enable it to acquire the interests of the other partner. However, the partner receiving an offer to be bought out will have the right to buy out such offering partner at the same price offered.
Location and demographics
The property is located east of the Harrisburg capital region in Pennsylvania adjacent to major thoroughfares, including Interstate 83. The following are key demographic and other information that we expect will benefit the Harrisburg Mall:
•
Population. The Harrisburg metropolitan statistical area population was 629,401 according to the US Census Bureau Census 2000.
•
Population Growth. The population within a 15-mile radius of the Harrisburg Mall is estimated to have grown by approximately 4.5% from 2000 to 2007 and is projected to grow by 2.7% from 2007 to 2012, according to Claritas.
•
Household Income. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average household income within a 15-mile radius of the Harrisburg Mall was estimated to be $68,310 according to Claritas.
•
Local Market Characteristics. The Harrisburg region’s economy is dominated by State and Federal Government, which tends to insulate the region from major economic downturns in the national economy.
The Harrisburg Mall is located within a 10 minute drive from the city of Hershey and Hershey Park, which is a national tourist destination.
Competition
The primary competitors of the Harrisburg Mall include two regional malls that jointly comprise approximately 1.4 million square feet of shop space. Four power centers that comprise approximately 1.7 million square feet are located within seven miles of the property. In addition we expect to compete with a new lifestyle center within four miles of the property. We believe there are no major regional mall projects under construction or planned for the near future.

Regulation
Generally, the ownership and operation of real properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of regional mall sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties, or restrict certain further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and could also result in an order to correct any non-complying feature and in substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our properties are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA.
Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.
Property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.
Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, operating income, expense or cash flow.
Environmental Matters
Pursuant to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be required to investigate, remove and/or remediate a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property. Further, under certain circumstances, such owners or operators of real property may be held liable for property damage, personal injury and/or natural resource damage resulting from or arising in connection with such releases. Certain of these laws have been interpreted to impose joint and several liability unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The failure to properly remediate the property may also adversely affect the owner’s ability to lease, sell or rent the property or to borrow using the property as collateral.
In connection with the ownership, operation and management of our current or past properties and any properties that we may acquire and/or manage in the future, we could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property. In order to assess the potential for such liability, we conduct an environmental assessment of each property prior to acquisition and manage our properties in accordance with environmental laws while we own or operate them. We and our predecessor engaged qualified, reputable and adequately insured environmental consulting firms to perform environmental site assessments of all of our properties and we are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to materially impact the operations of any property.
Insurance
We believe that our properties are covered by adequate fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders) and property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. Furthermore, we believe our businesses and
business assets are likewise adequately insured against casualty loss and third-party liabilities. Changes in the insurance market since September 11, 2001 have caused increases in insurance costs and deductibles and have led to more active management of our insurance component.
