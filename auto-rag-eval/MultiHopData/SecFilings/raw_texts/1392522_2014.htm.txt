Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and our financial condition as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes in “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"). This discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Freescale Semiconductor, Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale Inc.”), are collectively referred to as the “Company,” “Freescale,” “we,” “us” or “our,” as the context requires.
Our Business. We are a global leader in microcontrollers and digital networking processors, commonly referred to as embedded processors. Embedded processors are the backbone of electronic systems, providing essential control, intelligence and security, while enhancing performance and power efficiency. We combine our embedded processors with our complementary analog, sensor and radio frequency (RF) devices, as well as a full suite of software and design tools, to provide highly integrated embedded processing solutions that streamline customer development efforts, lower their costs and shorten their time to market.
A number of trends are driving growth in our end markets, including advances in automotive safety and electronics, the expansion of cloud computing, the proliferation of low-power, energy-efficient control devices, the build-out of next generation communications infrastructure and the Internet of Things ("IoT"), an emerging network of smart devices designed to help make our lives safer and more productive. Our product and strategic focus is to serve the need for increased connectivity and enhanced intelligence critical to fast growing semiconductor applications while keeping the connection secure. Our business is organized around five principal product groups: Microcontrollers, Digital Networking, Automotive MCU, Analog & Sensors, and RF. We provide our customers with secure embedded processing solutions along with complementary devices for the automotive, networking, industrial and consumer end markets.
We have a heritage of innovation and product leadership spanning over 50 years and an extensive intellectual property portfolio. We leverage our intellectual property portfolio, deep customer relationships built over many years of close collaboration, extensive suite of software and design tools and technical expertise to introduce innovative new products and platform-level solutions for our target markets.
We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers through our global sales force. Our ten largest end customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately 40%, 38% and 39% of our net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Continental Automotive represented 14%, 15% and 15% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As a result of the consolidation of our global distribution sales network in early 2014, Avnet, Inc. and Arrow Electronics, Inc. each represented more than 10% of our net sales in 2014. Individually, neither distributor comprised more than 10% of our net sales in either 2013 or 2012. For each of the last three years, greater than 80% of our products were sold into countries other than the United States. Our net product sales into the Asia-Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Americas and Japan regions represented approximately 54%, 23%, 17% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales in 2014.
The trend for increased connectivity, security, content and capabilities along with higher performance, power efficiency, lower cost and faster time to market are the primary drivers of the growth of embedded processing solutions in electronic devices. The majority of our net sales is derived from five product groups. Our Microcontrollers product group represented 21%, 20% and 18% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. MCUs are a self-contained embedded control system with processors, memory and peripherals on a chip. Combined with applications processors, we deliver solutions for automotive, industrial, smart energy, healthcare and multimedia applications while enabling the IoT. Our Digital Networking product group represented 22% of our total net sales in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. We offer a scalable portfolio of multicore communication processors and wireless-infrastructure processors for the networking and communication markets. Our products provide enhanced intelligence and connectivity to the telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and general embedded connectivity nodes that enable the IoT. Our Automotive MCU product group represented 26%, 25% and 25% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our Automotive MCUs are developed specifically for the critical performance and quality requirements of the automotive industry. We enable the latest developments in advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment and electrified powertrain. Our Analog & Sensors product group represented 17%, 18% and 18% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our analog, mixed-signal analog and sensor products capture, manage and transmit data from the real-world environment for use in embedded processing applications in the automotive, industrial and consumer markets. These devices complement our MCUs in applications such as robotics, factory automation, automotive radar, braking and airbag control. Our RF product group represented 12%, 8% and 8% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We supply RF high-power products into the wireless infrastructure market and are expanding our
portfolio to leverage our RF technology leadership into adjacent power transistor markets, such as lasers, avionics, mobile radio and military. The significant driver behind the increasing RF net sales has been the continued growth of next generation wireless basestation spending, primarily in China.
Conditions Impacting Our Business. Our business results are impacted by demand for electronic content in automobiles, networking and wireless infrastructure equipment, industrial and factory automation and consumer electronic devices. We operate in an industry that is cyclical and subject to technological changes, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life-cycles, changing customer inventory levels and fluctuations in product supply and demand.
Our total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased by $110 million, or 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2014. The decline in revenue was attributable to lower demand from certain service provider customers, reduced sales into the industrial market, a more than seasonal decline in automotive revenue as our customers managed their year-end inventory levels along with seasonal declines in consumer sales, partially offset by LTE wireless basestation expansion, particularly in China, benefiting RF revenue. Despite the lower revenue level and lower fixed cost leverage as a result of lower utilization, our gross margin increased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the third quarter of 2014, due primarily to operational efficiencies and procurement savings, lower incentive compensation and the reclassification of our patent costs from Cost of Sales to Selling, General and Administrative expense, which accounted for approximately 40 basis points of the sequential gross margin improvement. Capital expenditures were $74 million, or 7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $63 million, or 5% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting continued capacity increases for our RF products.
Net sales in the near term will depend on general global economic activity and our ability to meet unscheduled or temporary increases in demand in our target markets, among other factors. We anticipate that our total net sales will increase on a sequential basis as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to increased sales into the automotive market along with higher sales of RF products to our wireless infrastructure customers as we continue to make progress to address demand. We expect our gross margin to remain relatively flat into the first quarter as we expect improvements in sales growth, utilization and productivity will be offset by the impact of decreases in average selling prices resulting from our annual negotiations with our customers that will go into effect in the first quarter of 2015, the nonrecurrence of certain purchasing rebates achieved in 2014 and the impact of annual merit increases. For more information on trends and other factors affecting our business, refer to Part I, Item 1A: "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report.
Capital Restructuring Activities. During the first quarter of 2014, we completed an equity issuance from which we received net proceeds totaling approximately $717 million, which were used, along with cash on hand, to redeem $680 million of outstanding indebtedness and pay related call premiums. Also during the first quarter of 2014, Freescale Inc. completed a debt refinancing transaction which extended the maturity of $347 million of our indebtedness and reduced the interest rate on $2.7 billion of indebtedness. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, Freescale Inc. redeemed $200 million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, Freescale Inc. delivered notice of redemption of the remaining $180 million of 8.05% Unsecured Notes and redemption of $70 million of 10.75% Unsecured Notes to occur in the first quarter of 2015. The combined impact of these transactions will reduce our annualized cash interest expense by approximately $115 million based on current interest rates. (Refer to Note 4, "Debt," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Activities” for additional discussion of these transactions.)
Selected Statement of Operations Items
Orders
Orders are placed by customers for delivery for up to as much as twelve months in the future. However, only orders expected to be fulfilled during the 13 weeks following the last day of a quarter are included in orders for that quarter. Orders presented as of the end of a year are the sum of orders for each of the quarters in that fiscal year. Typically, agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions and are, as a matter of industry practice, rarely formally enforced. Therefore, most of our orders are cancellable. We track orders because we believe that it provides visibility into our potential future net sales.
Net Sales
Our net sales originate from the sale of our embedded processors and other semiconductor products and the licensing and sale of our intellectual property. The majority of our net sales are derived from our five major product groups: Microcontrollers, Digital Networking, Automotive MCU, Analog & Sensors, and RF. We also derive net sales from “Other” which consists of product sales associated with end markets outside of our target markets, including the cellular market, intellectual property licensing and sales, foundry wafer sales to other semiconductor companies and net sales from sources other than semiconductors. We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We also use distributors for a portion of our sales and recognize net sales upon the delivery of our products to the distributors. Distributor net sales are reduced for estimated returns and distributor sales incentives.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales are costs incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, the cost of assembly and test operations, shipping and handling costs associated with product sales and provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties (which are made at the time the related sale is recorded based on historic trends).
We currently manufacture the majority of our products internally at our three wafer fabrication facilities and two assembly and test facilities. We track our inventory and cost of sales by using standard costs that are reviewed at least twice a year and are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin is significantly influenced by the utilization rates in our owned wafer fabrication facilities. Utilization refers only to our wafer fabrication facilities and is based on the capacity of the installed equipment. As utilization rates increase, operating leverage increases because fixed manufacturing costs are spread over higher output. We experienced an increase in our utilization rate to 90% during 2014 compared to 86% during 2013.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses are costs incurred in the selling and marketing of our products and services to customers, corporate overhead and other operating costs. Selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, costs of advertising, trade shows and corporate marketing. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees and other corporate expenses.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and include the cost of activities attributable to development and pre-production efforts associated with designing, developing and testing new or significantly enhanced products or process and packaging technology. These costs consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, amortization of purchased technology, engineering design development software and hardware tools, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, software to support new products and design environments, project material costs and third-party fees paid to consultants.
Amortization Expense for Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets largely consists of the amortization of assets acquired as a part of the Merger which are being amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years, and which will end in 2016. Additionally, we are recording amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in connection with two business acquisitions completed during 2014. These assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to three years, ending in 2017. (Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," and to Note 14, “Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements,” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition and discussion of the term Merger. Refer to Note 2, "Other Financial Data" for discussion of the acquisition transactions.)
Results of Operations
Percentage of Net Sales
Net Sales
Our net sales increased by $448 million, or 11%, and our orders increased by 8% in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by growth across all of our product groups and end markets. This sales growth was partially offset by lower intellectual property revenue and declines in sales of legacy products into the cellular market. Distribution sales to customers serviced exclusively through the distribution channel were approximately 27% of net sales in 2014 compared to 25% of net sales in 2013. Distribution sales increased $208 million, or 20%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Distribution inventory, in dollars, was 10.0 weeks at December 31, 2014, compared to 9.1 weeks at December 31, 2013. The increase in weeks of distribution inventory was due to lower sales during the fourth quarter of 2014 along with the consolidation of our global distribution network earlier in the year. As a result of the consolidation of our global distribution sales network in early 2014, Avnet, Inc. and Arrow Electronics, Inc. each represented more than 10% of our net sales in 2014.
Our net sales increased by $241 million, or 6%, and our orders increased 8% in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by growth across all of our product groups with significant growth in the automotive, networking and industrial end markets along with
higher intellectual property revenue. This sales growth was partially offset by declines in sales of legacy products into the cellular market. Distribution sales were approximately 25% of net sales in 2013 and represented an increase of 14% compared to 2012. Distribution inventory, in dollars, was 9.1 weeks at December 31, 2013, compared to 9.7 weeks at December 31, 2012. The decrease in weeks of distribution inventory, as compared to the prior year, was due to our distributors continuing to closely manage their inventory levels.
Net sales by product group for the three and year ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:
Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers' net sales increased by $125 million, or 15%, in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by growth in both microcontrollers and applications processors. The increase in microcontroller revenue was largely due to increasing sales of our 32-bit microcontrollers sold through distribution into several markets including medical and industrial along with strength in sales of legacy products. The increase in applications processors revenue was driven by increased sales both into the worldwide automotive and consumer markets and higher sales through distribution.
Microcontrollers' net sales increased by $119 million, or 17%, in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by growth in microcontrollers and applications processors. The increase in microcontrollers related to higher sales to original equipment manufacturers, while the increase in applications processors related to increased sales into the automotive market. Additionally, we experienced higher net sales through our distribution channel in all our key geographies.
Digital Networking
Digital Networking's net sales increased by $123 million, or 13%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Sales growth in both periods was broad-based with higher sales of service provider equipment including wireless basestations in China, general embedded products sold into the distribution channel and next generation enterprise systems. During the fourth quarter of 2014, net sales were impacted by lower demand from certain service provider customers and lower sales into the industrial market.
Digital Networking's net sales increased by $63 million, or 7%, in 2013 compared to 2012. Sales growth was broad-based with higher sales of next generation enterprise systems, service provider equipment and general embedded products sold into the distribution channel, partially offset by declines in certain legacy equipment sales.
Automotive MCU
Automotive MCU's net sales increased by $123 million, or 12%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The growth was due to an increase in worldwide automotive production, growth in vehicle semiconductor content along with increased sales into the distribution channel.
Automotive MCU's net sales increased by $77 million, or 8%, in 2013 compared to 2012. We experienced increased revenue due to higher worldwide automotive production in geographies where we have a significant presence, such as the U.S., China and Europe.
Analog & Sensors
Analog & Sensors' net sales increased by $61 million, or 8%, during 2014 compared to 2013. Over 85% of our Analog & Sensors sales are into the automotive market. We experienced higher net sales due to growth in the automotive market for both our Analog & Sensor products due primarily to increased semiconductor content driven by fuel efficiency requirements and safety features coupled with an increase in worldwide automotive production.
Analog & Sensors' net sales increased by $14 million, or 2%, during 2013 compared to 2012. We experienced higher net sales due to growth in the automotive and industrial markets during 2013. Total net sales into the automotive market were partially offset as a result of end of life shipments in 2012 in connection with the closure of our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility.
RF
RF's net sales increased by $202 million, or 57%, in 2014 compared to 2013 and by $49 million, or 16%, in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by continued growth in next generation wireless basestation spending, primarily in China. Our RF product group represented 12%, 8% and 8% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The growth in RF net sales continues to be impacted by supply constraints associated with demand related to wireless basestation expansion. We are investing in capital and working with suppliers to improve supply in 2015.
Other
Other net sales decreased by $186 million, or 63%, in 2014 compared to 2013 and by $81 million, or 22%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower intellectual property revenue in 2014 and decreased cellular product sales throughout 2013 and 2014. As a percentage of net sales, intellectual property revenue was 1%, 5% and 5% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our intellectual property revenue during 2013 and 2012 significantly exceeded our historical average of approximately 3% of net sales and benefited from certain agreements entered into during 2012. The revenue stream attributed to these agreements ended in 2013. Agreements of similar size may not occur in the future, and we expect lower levels of intellectual property revenue to persist.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin increased by $338 million, or 19%, during 2014 compared to 2013 which was primarily driven by a 11% increase in our net sales. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin was 45.9% in 2014, reflecting an increase of 320 basis points compared to 2013. Improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to procurement savings, operational efficiencies and an increase in utilization of our manufacturing assets, which contributed to improvements in operating leverage of our fixed manufacturing costs and higher revenues. Front-end wafer manufacturing facility utilization improved from 86% during 2013 to 90% during 2014 due to increased demand. The higher level of utilization has impacted our ability to meet customer demand for certain of our products. We expect to make further progress in 2015 to continue to better address RF demand with the installation of additional capacity. We also transitioned personnel from roles focusing on manufacturing cost reduction, factory closure and customer qualification efforts to roles supporting various new product development initiatives, and reclassified a portion of our patent costs from cost of sales to selling, general and administrative expense, both which had a positive impact on the year over year improvement in gross margin. These improvements were partially offset by lower intellectual property revenue, the impact of decreases in average selling prices resulting from our annual negotiations with our customers that went into effect during the first quarter of 2014 along with higher incentive compensation and merit increases.
Our gross margin increased by $146 million, or 9%, during 2013 compared to 2012 which was primarily driven by a 6% increase in our net sales. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin was 42.7%, reflecting an increase of 110 basis points compared to 2012. Improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to an increase in utilization of our front-end manufacturing assets, which contributed to improvements in operating leverage of our fixed manufacturing costs. Front-end wafer manufacturing facility utilization improved from 77% during 2012 to 86% during 2013 due to increased demand and the transfer of production from our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility to our 200 millimeter manufacturing facilities. Additional factors benefiting gross margin included procurement savings and operational efficiencies. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of decreases in average selling price resulting from our annual negotiations with our customers that went into effect during the first quarter of 2013, adverse changes in product sales mix and higher incentive compensation.
Selling, General and Administrative
Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $35 million, or 8%, in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and additional resources and strategic spend on sales and marketing efforts. Partially offsetting these increases were lower litigation costs in 2014 and the impact of the settlement of intellectual property litigation during 2013. As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 at approximately 11%.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $26 million, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012. This increase is primarily the result of higher incentive compensation, settlement of intellectual property litigation and commitments for charitable contributions to the Freescale Foundation, a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization we established to support science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education initiatives. These increases were partially offset by lower marketing spending and the elimination of costs associated with the lease of our corporate aircraft, which we terminated in 2012. As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat at 11% in both 2013 and 2012.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses increased by $91 million, or 12%, in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was related to additional investment in our strategic areas and next generation technologies, including the aforementioned personnel move from manufacturing cost reduction activities to roles focusing on new product development initiatives, along with higher
incentive compensation. As a percentage of net sales, our research and development expenses were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 at approximately 18%.
Our research and development expenses increased by $13 million, or 2%, in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase is related to additional investment in our strategic areas and higher incentive compensation partially offset by cost savings as a result of the employee transitions related to the strategic transformation program implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, our research and development expenses were 18% in 2013 reflecting a decrease of 80 basis points compared to 2012.
Amortization Expense for Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to tradenames/trademarks, customer relationships and developed technology increased by $2 million, or 15%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of incremental amortization associated with two business acquisitions completed during 2014. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded $18 million of intangible assets, largely comprised of customer relationships, which will be amortized over periods ranging from one to three years. Amortization expense remained relatively flat in 2013 as compared to 2012 as the majority of the intangible assets established in connection with the Merger had reached a normalized amortization run rate during those periods.
Reorganization of Business and Other
During 2014, we recorded (i) $8 million in charges related to on-going closure and decommissioning costs for our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility, (ii) $30 million in net charges primarily related to employee separation costs in connection with the continued execution of the reorganization plan initiated in 2012 (the "Strategic Realignment") and (iii) $7 million in charges largely related to the write-down of the net book value of certain assets to their fair market values less the expected cost to sell associated with the classification of the assets as available for sale during the year. These charges were partially offset by a net benefit of $8 million related to the sale of the land at our former manufacturing facility located in Sendai, Japan after accounting for the associated demolition costs. (Refer to Note 10, “Reorganization of Business and Other,” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the charges discussed in this section.)
During 2013, we recorded $36 million of charges primarily related to (i) the continued execution of the Strategic Realignment, (ii) exit costs for the consolidation of workspace in both Austin, Texas and Israel, (iii) the write down of specific manufacturing assets to fair value and a related contract termination charge due to the elimination of certain manufacturing processes for some of our next generation products and (iv) charges related to indemnification provisions included in our current CEO's employment agreement. These charges were partially offset by (i) a net benefit of $7 million associated with our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility, which included a benefit for proceeds received for the sale of certain of our equipment and machinery partially offset by charges related to on-going closure and decommissioning costs for this site and (ii) a net benefit of $5 million related to the sale of a portion of our of former manufacturing facility center located in Sendai, Japan.
In 2012, we recorded a benefit of $90 million for earthquake-related business interruption insurance recoveries related to our Sendai, Japan fabrication facility, which suffered extensive damage from the March 2011 earthquake. We also recorded a benefit of $9 million related to proceeds received in connection with the sale of the Sendai, Japan design center. These benefits were partially offset by $9 million of expenses related to on-going closure costs and other costs associated with the dissolution of the Sendai, Japan entity. Additionally, we recorded benefits totaling $16 million primarily related to the expiration of contractual obligations associated with to the wind down of our cellular handset business and the expiration of indemnification obligations under a contract previously executed outside the ordinary course of business. These benefits were partially offset by charges of $52 million including a non-cash accelerated amortization charge and cash costs for employee termination benefits and other exit costs recorded in connection with the Strategic Realignment. Additionally we recorded charges of $39 million primarily for (i) exit costs related to the termination of various supply agreements, on-going closure and decommissioning costs incurred in connection with the closure of our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility, (ii) the change in the executive leadership of the Company and (iii) costs recorded in connection with the termination of our corporate aircraft lease agreement.
Loss on Extinguishment or Modification of Long-Term Debt
During 2014, we recorded charges of $79 million associated with the redemption of outstanding indebtedness and refinancing transactions. These charges consisted of call premiums, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount ("OID") associated with the extinguished debt along with other expenses not eligible for capitalization. (Refer to Note 4, "Debt," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about the transactions discussed in this section.)
During 2013, we recorded charges of $217 million associated with the redemption of outstanding indebtedness, the extinguishment and modification of existing debt and the issuance of new term loans. These charges consisted of call premiums, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, OID and other expenses not eligible for capitalization.
During 2012, we recorded charges of $32 million associated with the extinguishment and modification of existing debt, the issuance of a new term loan and the redemption of outstanding indebtedness. These charges consisted of call premiums, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other costs not eligible for capitalization.
Other Expense, Net
Net interest expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included interest expense of $353 million, $490 million and $519 million, respectively, partially offset by interest income of $10 million, $7 million and $9 million, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due to the reduction in our outstanding indebtedness along with a lower weighted average interest rate over the comparative periods.
As a result of multiple debt refinancing and redemption transactions along with the quarterly term loan amortization payments, we have reduced our outstanding indebtedness by approximately $790 million and lowered our annualized interest expense by approximately $170 million, based on current interest rates, since the beginning of 2013, and have reduced our weighted average cash interest rate from 7.4% at December 31, 2012 to 5.4% at December 31, 2014. (Refer to Note 4, "Debt," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more discussion of these refinancing and redemption transactions.)
During 2012, we also recorded losses in other, net of $21 million attributable to the realized results and changes in the fair value associated with our interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency fluctuations.
Income Tax Expense
During 2014, we recorded an income tax provision of $53 million predominately related to our foreign operations. This income tax provision included income tax expense of $17 million associated with discrete events largely related to (i) a partial release of a foreign valuation allowance due to realizability of foreign research credits, (ii) the impact of adjustments necessary in connection with tax returns filed during the period, (iii) an increase in the domestic valuation allowance resulting from the deferred tax asset created by the excess tax benefit from share-based awards during the period and (iv) the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets that are expected to qualify for an incentive tax rate. Excluding discrete tax items, income tax expense was $36 million in 2014. This amount primarily reflects tax expense attributable to income earned in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
In 2013, we recorded an income tax provision of $40 million, which included a net income tax expense of $4 million attributable to discrete events related primarily to withholding tax on intellectual property royalties. The increase in tax expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily the result of changes in foreign tax rates on deferred tax assets attributable to certain of our non-U.S. operations.
In 2012, we recorded an income tax provision of $2 million, which included a $34 million net tax benefit primarily related to the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits from foreign audit activity and statute lapses as well as tax benefits from deferred tax positions in China. Excluding discrete tax items, income tax expense was $36 million in both 2013 and 2012. These amounts primarily reflect tax expense attributable to income earned in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Although the Company is a Bermuda entity with a statutory income tax rate of zero, the earnings of many of the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Our annual effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings and losses by taxing jurisdiction and was different from the Bermuda statutory rate of zero due to (i) income tax expense incurred by subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions that impose an income tax, (ii) the mix of earnings and losses across various taxing jurisdictions, (iii) a foreign capital investment incentive providing for enhanced tax deductions associated with capital expenditures in one of our foreign manufacturing facilities and (iv) the effect of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions. We record minimal tax expense on our U.S. earnings due to valuation allowances recorded on substantially all the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that our domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized in their entirety. In our assessment of the need for a domestic valuation allowance, we heavily weighted the following negative evidence: (i) a lack of operational profitability in the U.S. Company, exclusive of foreign intercompany dividends, (ii) forecasted reversal of existing temporary differences does not create taxable income and (iii) the Company operates in a highly cyclical industry. (Refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our income tax expense.)

Of the $696 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, $298 million is attributable to our U.S. subsidiaries and $398 million is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of the funds of these foreign subsidiaries could be subject to delay and potential tax consequences, principally with respect to withholding taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions.
Operating Activities
We generated cash flow from operations of $504 million, $321 million and $350 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in cash generated from operations in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable (i) higher sales and resulting profitability, (ii) lower cash paid for interest as a result of various debt redemption and refinancing transactions that occurred during 2013 and 2014, and (iii) lower payments for employee severance. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in receivables, as described below, a strategic increase in days inventory on hand, higher payments for incentive
compensation during 2014 along with higher intellectual property transaction proceeds and the receipt of a withholding tax rebate during 2013.
The decrease in cash generated from operations in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to proceeds from the Sendai, Japan earthquake-related insurance recoveries received during 2012, higher intellectual property transaction proceeds in 2012 along with higher payments for incentive compensation during 2013. These declines were partially offset by (i) higher revenues, (ii) the strategic reduction of days of inventory on hand and (iii) lower cash paid for interest as a result of the various debt redemption and refinancing transactions that occurred during 2013.
Our days of inventory on hand increased to 116 days at December 31, 2014 from 110 days at December 31, 2013 and decreased from 125 days at December 31, 2012. The increase in days of inventory on hand from 2013 is due to the strategic inventory build based on the anticipated revenue levels in the automotive market in the first quarter of 2015. Our days sales outstanding increased to 46 days at December 31, 2014 from 33 days at December 31, 2013 and 37 days at December 31, 2012. The increase in days sales outstanding was the result of changes in payment terms implemented with specific customers and sales linearity during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect days sales outstanding to decrease slightly going forward. Our days purchases outstanding increased to 65 days at December 31, 2014 from 60 days at December 31, 2013 and 51 days at December 31, 2012, reflecting the timing of payments on our payables.
Investing Activities
Our net cash utilized for investing activities was $334 million, $210 million and $176 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our investing activities are driven primarily by capital expenditures and payments for purchased licenses and other assets. The cash utilized for investing activities in 2014 increased from the prior years and was predominately the result of increased capital expenditures, which were $249 million, $151 million and $123 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and represented 5%, 4% and 3% of net sales, respectively. The higher capital expenditures are associated with increasing our manufacturing capacity to fulfill demand primarily from our RF and microcontroller customers. In addition, the cash paid for purchased licenses and other assets increased to $81 million from $70 million in 2013 and $73 million in 2012. The remaining $20 million of cash utilized in 2014 largely related to two business acquisitions, the value of which was primarily intangible assets and inventory. During 2014, we received $16 million in net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment predominately related to the sale of the land located at the site of our former manufacturing facility in Sendai, Japan. The $11 million of net proceeds received in 2013 were primarily attributable to the sale of certain tools and equipment located at our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility and the sale of a portion of our former manufacturing facility in Sendai, Japan. We received $20 million of proceeds in 2012 primarily as a result of the sale of the Sendai, Japan design center and the sale of certain tools and equipment located at our Toulouse, France manufacturing facility.
Financing Activities
Our net cash utilized for financing activities was $207 million, $71 million and $232 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash flows utilized for financing activities in 2014 included $1.6 billion of payments on debt obligations comprised of (i) payments of $718 million associated with the extinguishment of approximately $680 million of indebtedness along with $38 million of call premiums in connection with the use of proceeds from the equity offering completed during the first quarter of 2014, (ii) payments of $597 million to lenders in connection with the $2.7 billion term loan refinancing transaction completed in the first quarter of 2014, (iii) $35 million of amortization payments on the term loans and (iv) payments of $217 million associated with the debt redemptions that occurred during the second half of 2014. Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included (i) $590 million of proceeds, net of transaction costs, related to funds received from lenders under the term loan refinancing and revolver modification transactions which occurred in the first quarter of 2014 and (ii) $717 million of net proceeds from the equity offering completed during the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included $47 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee share purchase program (ESPP) share purchases and $7 million of excess tax benefits resulting from deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting. (Refer to Note 6, "Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on ESPP and stock options and Note 7, "Income Taxes," for further information on the tax benefit.)
Cash flows related to financing activities in 2013 included (i) the prepayment of term loans totaling $2,711 million in connection with the refinancing transaction in the first quarter of 2013, (ii) the redemption of a portion of our secured notes, including payment of the related make-whole premiums, totaling $495 million in connection with the refinancing transaction in the second quarter of 2013, (iii) the redemption of $98 million principal amount of unsecured notes during the third quarter of 2013, (iv) the redemption of secured notes and payment of the related make-whole premiums totaling $782 million made as part of the refinancing transaction initiated during the third quarter which closed during the fourth quarter, (v) the redemption of secured notes and payment of the related make-whole premiums totaling $953 million in connection with the fourth quarter of 2013 refinancing transaction, along with (vi) $23 million primarily related to the quarterly principal payments on the term loans. These outflows were partially offset by the receipt of (i) $2,707 million in net proceeds from the issuance of term loans during the first quarter of 2013, (ii) $493 million in net proceeds from the issuance of secured notes during the second quarter
of 2013, (iii) $782 million in net proceeds from the issuance of term loans during the third quarter of 2013 and (iv) $947 million in net proceeds from the issuance of secured notes during the fourth quarter of 2013. Additionally, cash provided by financing activities in 2013 included $62 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and ESPP share purchases.
Cash flows related to financing activities in 2012 included (i) the repayment of $500 million of senior subordinated notes in connection with the refinancing transaction in the first quarter of 2012, along with call premiums of $25 million, (ii) the repayment of $200 million of unsecured notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2012, along with call premiums of $2 million and (iii) $7 million primarily related to the quarterly principal payments on term loans. These payments were partially offset by the receipt of $481 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the term loans in the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, cash provided by financing activities during 2012 included $21 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and ESPP share purchases.
Third and Fourth Quarter of 2014 Debt Redemption Transactions
On September 29, 2014, after the requisite notice period, Freescale Inc. utilized $110 million to redeem $100 million principal amount of the senior unsecured 8.05% notes due 2020 (the "8.05% Unsecured Notes") and pay call premiums of $9 million and accrued interest of $1 million.
On November 10, 2014, after the requisite notice period, Freescale Inc. utilized approximately $110 million to redeem $100 million principal amount of the 8.05% Unsecured Notes and pay call premiums of $8 million and accrued interest of $2 million.
First Quarter of 2014 Revolver Amendment and Debt Redemption Transactions
On February 10, 2014, Freescale Inc. entered into an amendment to its existing revolving credit facility which became effective on February 18, 2014 (the "Q1 2014 Revolver Amendment"). Pursuant to the amendment, the existing revolving credit facility was replaced with a new revolving credit facility with an aggregate of $400 million of commitments (the "2019 Revolver"). The amendment also extended the maturity of the new revolving credit facility to February 1, 2019. The 2019 Revolver is subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the prior revolving credit facility including the same pro rata split between United States Dollar and alternative currency availability.
On March 20, 2014, after the requisite notice period, Freescale Inc. utilized approximately $717 million of net proceeds from the equity offering, along with cash on hand, to redeem $264 million of outstanding senior subordinated 10.125% notes due 2016, $57 million of outstanding senior unsecured floating rate notes due 2014 and $359 million of 8.05% Unsecured Notes and to pay call premiums of $38 million and accrued interest of $11 million.
First Quarter of 2014 Term Loan Refinancing Transaction
On March 4, 2014, Freescale, Inc. entered into an amendment and refinancing agreement to its senior secured term loan facilities, which effectively (i) lowered the interest rate of our existing $347 million senior secured term loan facility maturing in December 2016 (the “2016 Term Loan”) and extended the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan to March 2020 to coincide with the maturity of its existing $2.37 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March 2020 (the “2020 Term Loan”), and (ii) lowered the interest rate applicable to the 2020 Term Loan in a transaction referred to as the "Q1 2014 Term Loan Refinancing Transaction."
In connection with this transaction, (i) a portion of the existing lenders under the 2016 Term Loan agreed to the lower interest rate and extended maturity, (ii) a portion of the existing lenders under the 2020 Term Loan agreed to the lower interest rate, and (iii) Freescale used the proceeds of new senior secured term loans to refinance in full the 2016 Term Loan lenders and the 2020 Term Loan lenders who did not agree to the amendment. As a result, the amended 2016 Term Loan, the amended 2020 Term Loan and the new senior secured term loan, now have identical terms and are treated as a single tranche of senior secured term loans with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $2.72 billion, collectively referred to as the "Amended 2020 Term Loan."
The Amended 2020 Term Loan was issued at par, but was originally recorded at a $21 million discount, reflecting a portion of the remaining OID previously attributable to the 2020 Term Loan which was deemed exchanged for the Amended 2020 Term Loan. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Amended 2020 Term Loan were used to prepay portions of the 2016 and 2020 Term Loans, thus relieving Freescale Inc., Freescale Ltd. and certain other Freescale Ltd. subsidiaries of their obligations associated with that liability. A significant portion of our lenders under the Amended 2020 Term Loan were previously lenders under the 2016 and 2020 Term Loans, while some of the funds from the issuance of the Amended 2020 Term Loan were from new lenders.
Credit Facility
At December 31, 2014, Freescale Inc.’s senior secured credit facilities (the "Credit Facility") included (i) $2,692 million outstanding under the Amended 2020 Term Loan, (ii) $790 million outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2021 ("2021 Term Loan") and (iii) the 2019 Revolver, including letters of credit and swing line loan sub-facilities, with a committed capacity of $400 million. The spread over LIBOR with respect to the Amended 2020 Term Loan is 3.25%,
with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.25% at December 31, 2014. The spread over LIBOR with respect to 2021 Term Loan is 3.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.25%, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.00% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2014, the available capacity under the 2019 Revolver was $384 million, as reduced by $16 million of outstanding letters of credit. Under the third amended and restated credit agreement as of March 1, 2013 as amended by the Q1 2014 Revolver Amendment and the Q1 2014 Term Loan Refinancing Transaction (the "Credit Agreement"), Freescale Inc. is required to repay a portion both of the Amended 2020 Term Loan and 2021 Term Loan in quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the initial outstanding balance, or approximately $35 million annually.
Senior Notes
Freescale Inc. had an aggregate principal amount of $2,113 million in senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2014, consisting of (i) $500 million of 5.00% senior secured notes due 2021 ("5.00% Secured Notes"), (ii) $960 million of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2022 ("6.00% Secured Notes"), (iii) $473 million of 10.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020 ("10.75% Unsecured Notes) and (iv) $180 million of 8.05% Unsecured Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"). With regard to these notes, interest is payable semi-annually in arrears as follows: (i) every May 15th and November 15th for the 5.00% Secured Notes; (ii) every May 15th and November 15th for the 6.00% Secured Notes; (iii) every February 1st and August 1st for the 10.75% Unsecured Notes; and (iv) every February 1st and August 1st for the 8.05% Unsecured Notes.
Hedging Transactions
During 2014, we entered into cash flow designated interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt against exposure to increasing LIBOR rates which may exceed the LIBOR floor on the Amended 2020 Term Loan in future periods. Under these agreements, we are required to pay the counterparties a stream of fixed rate interest payments at a weighted average rate of: (i) 1.62% on a notional amount of $1.4 billion in 2016, (ii) 2.43% on a notional amount of $1.1 billion in 2017 and (iii) 2.95% on a notional amount of $800 million in 2018. (Refer to Note 5, “Risk Management,” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these hedging agreements.)
Prior to 2013, Freescale Inc. utilized interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements with various counterparties as a hedge of the variable cash flows of our variable interest rate debt through 2016. In connection with the refinancing transaction in the first quarter of 2013, under which the majority of our debt essentially became fixed rate debt as long as LIBOR rates remain below the respective LIBOR floors on our variable rate term loans, we effectively terminated these previous agreements and fixed the remaining payment stream.
Debt Service
We are required to make debt service principal payments under the terms of our debt agreements. As of December 31, 2014, future obligated debt payments are $35 million each year from 2015 through 2019 and $5,420 million thereafter. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, Freescale Inc. delivered notice of a $180 million redemption of 8.05% Unsecured Notes and a $70 million redemption of 10.75% Unsecured Notes to occur in the first quarter of 2015. Accordingly, $250 million of principal payments previously obligated in 2020 will be paid in February 2015.
Fair Value
At December 31, 2014, the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of our long-term debt was approximately $5,568 million, exclusive of $35 million of current maturities, which was determined based upon quoted market prices. Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
Refer to Note 4, "Debt," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the indebtedness described in this section.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the senior secured and senior unsecured notes (the "Indentures"). Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash and other items that are included in net earnings (loss). Freescale Inc. is not subject to any maintenance covenants under its existing debt agreements and is therefore not required to maintain any minimum specified level of Adjusted EBITDA or maintain any ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA or otherwise. However, our ability to engage in specified activities is tied to ratios under Freescale Inc.'s debt agreements based on Adjusted EBITDA, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Our subsidiaries are unable to incur any indebtedness under the Indentures and specified indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, pay dividends, make certain investments and make other restricted payments, in each case not otherwise permitted by our debt agreements, unless, after giving effect to the proposed activity, the fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the applicable indenture) would be at least 2.00:1 and the senior secured first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) would be no greater than 4.00:1. Also, our subsidiaries may not incur certain indebtedness in connection with acquisitions unless, prior to and after giving effect to the proposed transaction, the total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is no greater than 6.50:1,
except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement. In addition, except as otherwise permitted by the applicable debt agreement, we may not designate any subsidiary as unrestricted or engage in certain mergers unless, after giving effect to the proposed transaction, the fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least 2.00:1 or equal to or greater than it was prior to the proposed transaction and the senior secured first lien leverage ratio would be no greater than 4.00:1. We are also unable to have liens on assets securing indebtedness without also securing the notes unless the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the applicable indenture) would be no greater than 3.25:1 after giving effect to the proposed lien, except as otherwise permitted by the Indentures. Accordingly, we believe it is useful to provide the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to investors for purposes of determining our ability to engage in these activities. As of December 31, 2014, Freescale Inc. was in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Facility and the Indentures and met the total leverage ratio, the senior secured first lien leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio but did not meet the consolidated secured debt ratio. As of December 31, 2014, Freescale Inc.'s total leverage ratio was 4.52:1, senior secured first lien leverage ratio was 3.88:1, the fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.67:1 and the consolidated secured debt ratio was 4.52:1. Accordingly, we are currently restricted from incurring liens on assets securing indebtedness, except as otherwise permitted by the Indentures. The fact that we did not meet one of these ratios does not result in any default under the Credit Agreement or the Indentures.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net earnings (loss), operating earnings (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA in the Indentures and the Credit Facility allows us to add back certain charges that are deducted in calculating net earnings (loss). However, some of these expenses may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. Further, our debt instruments require that Adjusted EBITDA be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We do not present Adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis. In addition, the measure can be disproportionately affected by quarterly fluctuations in our operating results, and it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.
The following is a reconciliation of net earnings, which is a U.S. GAAP measure of our operating results, to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated pursuant to Freescale Inc.'s debt agreements for the most recent four fiscal quarter period as required by such agreements.
Contractual Obligations
We own most of our major facilities, but we do lease certain office, factory and warehouse space, as well as data processing and other equipment primarily under non-cancellable operating leases.
Summarized in the table below are our obligations and commitments to make future payments in connection with our debt, minimum lease payment obligations (net of minimum sublease income), software, service, supply and other contracts, and product purchase commitments as of December 31, 2014.
(1)
Reflects the principal payments under the Credit Facility and the notes. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, Freescale Inc. delivered notice of redemption of $250 million of outstanding unsecured notes to occur in the first quarter of 2015. Accordingly, $250 million of principal payments previously obligated in 2020 will be paid in 2015. The above amounts exclude estimated cash interest payments of approximately $296 million in 2015, $288 million in 2016, $308 million in 2017, $316 million in 2018, $321 million in 2019 and $280 million thereafter (based on currently applicable interest rate curves in the case of variable interest rate debt, and all of which contemplate the impact of the above discussed Q1 2015 redemption). (Refer to Note 4, “Debt,” for further discussion of this redemption transaction.)
(2)
Includes capital lease obligations of less than $1 million in the aggregate which are payable through 2017.
(3)
Foundry commitments associated with our strategic manufacturing relationships are based on volume commitments for work in progress and forecasted demand based on 18-month rolling forecasts, which are adjusted monthly.
(4)
As of December 31, 2014, we had reserves of $138 million recorded for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. We are not including this amount in the long-term contractual obligations table presented because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
Future Financing Activities
Our primary future cash needs on a recurring basis will be for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, including debt service principal payments on the term loans. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, Freescale Inc. delivered notice of a $250 million redemption of unsecured notes to occur in the first quarter of 2015 for which we will pay call premiums approximating $18 million. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $28 million during 2015 and approximately $7 million thereafter in connection with the reorganization plan initiated during 2012 and the closure of the Toulouse, France manufacturing facility; however, the timing of these payments depends on many factors, including the timing of the decommissioning of the manufacturing facility and local employment laws, and actual amounts paid may vary based on currency fluctuation. During 2015, we plan to use cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations to redeem the majority of our remaining 10.75% Unsecured Notes. This will result in a reduction of cash and cash equivalents from the current level to a target level of approximately $500 million prospectively. We believe such a level of cash and cash equivalents combined with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, restructuring plan and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months. In addition, our ability to borrow under the 2019 Revolver was $384 million as of December 31, 2014, as reduced by $16 million of outstanding letters of credit. (Refer to Note 4, "Debt," and Note 10, "Reorganization of Business and Other," in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the borrowing abilities and reorganization actions described in this section.)
If our cash flows from operations are less than we expect or we require funds to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies, we may need to incur additional debt, sell or monetize certain existing assets or utilize our cash and cash equivalents. In the event additional funding is required, there can be no assurance that future funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and sell assets. We are highly leveraged, and this could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our non-hedged variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under one or more of our debt agreements. During 2014, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix the interest rates on a portion of our variable rate debt beginning in 2016 and continuing through 2018. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources to service our debt, or as the result of the inability to complete appropriate refinancings and amendments of our debt, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to seek the disposal of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default under one or more of our debt agreements and, as a result, we would need to take other action to satisfy our obligations or be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
As market conditions warrant, or as repurchase obligations under the agreements governing our Credit Facility and Senior Notes may require, we and our major equity holders may from time to time repurchase or redeem debt securities issued by Freescale Inc. through redemptions under the terms of the Indentures, in privately negotiated or open-market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or issue new debt in order to refinance or prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility or Senior Notes or for other permitted purposes. Further, depending on market conditions, the strategy for our capital structure and
other factors, we also may issue equity securities from time to time in public or private offerings. There can be no assurance, however, that any issuance of equity or debt will occur or be successful.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We use customary off-balance sheet arrangements, such as operating leases and letters of credit, to finance our business. None of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions generally require difficult and subjective accounting judgments and often involve matters that are inherently uncertain.
The estimates that shape our critical accounting policies are assessed on an on-going basis. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which might cause a material impact on our financial statements. Our management believes the following accounting policies to be those most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:
•
product sales and intellectual property revenue recognition and valuation;
•
accounting for income taxes;
•
inventory valuation methodology;
•
restructuring activities;
•
valuation of long-lived assets; and
•
share-based compensation.
We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our results. Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these policies.
Product Sales and Intellectual Property Revenue Recognition and Valuation
We generally market our products to a wide variety of end users and a network of distributors. Our policy is to record revenue for product sales when title transfers, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time of shipment. We record reductions to sales associated with reserves for allowances for collectability, discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs at the time the related sale is recognized. The establishment of such reserves is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. The process of evaluating these factors is highly subjective and requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, forecasted demand, returns, industry pricing assumptions, distributor resales and inventory levels. In future periods, additional provisions may be necessary due to (i) a deterioration in the semiconductor pricing environment, (ii) reductions in anticipated demand for semiconductor products and/or (iii) lack of market acceptance for new products. If these factors result in a significant adjustment to our reserves, they could significantly impact our future operating results.
Distributor reserves estimate the impact of credits granted to distributors under certain programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities, or are allowed to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. The Company’s policy is to use a rolling historical experience rate, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program, in order to estimate the proper provision for this program at the end of any given reporting period. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and distributor resales and inventory levels. Distributor reserves are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, 27%, 25% and 23% of our revenue, respectively, was generated from sales of our products to distributors for customers serviced exclusively through the distribution channel.
In revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables, judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of such multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among those
accounting units. Net sales from contracts with multiple deliverables are recognized as each deliverable is earned based on the relative fair value of each deliverable or based on each deliverable’s relative selling price depending on the underlying terms of the arrangement. When using each deliverable’s relative selling price various inputs may be required including, but not limited to, our pricing practices, gross margin objectives, internal costs and industry specific information. Changes in any number of these factors may have a substantial impact on the selling price as assigned to each deliverable. These inputs and assumptions represent management’s best estimates at the time of the transaction. Applicable receivables are discounted in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions. As a multinational corporation, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets, liabilities, net operating loss and other tax carryforwards. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether these deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. If negative evidence exists, positive evidence with greater weighting is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. Our framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires us to weigh all available evidence, including:
•
Nature, frequency, and severity of recent losses. Cumulative losses in recent years are heavily weighted negative evidence. We compute cumulative losses by adjusting pre-tax results (excluding the cumulative effects of accounting method changes and including “non-recurring” items such as restructuring or impairment charges) for permanent items on a rolling twelve quarter basis. Because the Company provides deferred taxes for the repatriation of foreign earnings, we give no weight to foreign intercompany dividends in our evaluation of profitability as this is not indicative of our ability to realize net deferred tax assets.
•
Strength and trend of earnings as well as other relevant factors. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, so forecasting future profitability is uncertain. Furthermore, the Company has required repatriation of foreign earnings to meet domestic cash needs, including debt service, research and development expenses and capital investments. A sustained period of profitability in our operations is required before we would change our judgment regarding the need for a valuation allowance.
•
Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes cumulative losses in recent years. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income limited weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment.
•
Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards.
As of December 31, 2014, we have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that our domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized in their entirety, and therefore, we have retained a valuation allowance against substantially all the domestic deferred tax assets. In our assessment of the need for a domestic valuation allowance, we heavily weighted the following negative evidence: i) a lack of operational profitability in the U.S. Company, exclusive of foreign intercompany dividends, ii) forecasted reversal of existing temporary differences does not create taxable income, and iii) the Company operates in a highly cyclical industry. Valuation allowances of $1,193 million have been recorded on substantially all our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014.
At the end of each quarter, we evaluate the valuation allowance by reviewing the factors discussed above. This ongoing assessment is based on estimates and requires significant management judgment. At this time, the Company believes it will not have cumulative losses (as described above) on a rolling twelve quarter basis at some point in the next twelve to 18 months, and it is reasonably possible such positive evidence may result in reversal of the valuation allowance within this time frame. For example, if the 2014 trend in quarterly domestic operational profitability continues throughout 2015, such valuation allowance reversal may occur in the next twelve to 18 months. Until we reverse the valuation allowance, consumption of tax attributes to offset profits will reduce the overall level of deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance. Any release of the domestic valuation allowance will be recorded as a non-cash deferred tax benefit, significantly increasing net earnings in the
quarter in which the allowance is released. After the valuation allowance is released, we anticipate an effective tax rate approaching the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The release of the valuation allowance has a minimal, if any, impact on current or projected cash income taxes. Cash taxes paid by the Company will continue to be driven by income in foreign jurisdictions until domestic income exceeds available tax attributes.
Additionally, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized after considering all positive and negative factors as to the recoverability of these assets. At December 31, 2014, valuation allowances of $43 million have also been recorded on certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.
We have reserves for taxes, associated interest, and other related costs that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are fully supported, we have established reserves recognizing that various taxing authorities may challenge certain positions and our tax positions may not be fully sustained. The tax reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statues of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, resolution of tax audits, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices, identification of new issues, and issuance of new regulations or new case law. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have an impact on our tax provision, net earnings and cash flows. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to record additional income tax expense (benefit) or adjust valuation allowances.
We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2014, we had reserves of $138 million for taxes, associated interest, and other related costs that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities.
The Company is a Bermuda exempted company and is not subject to income taxes in Bermuda. The Company has asserted the permanent reinvestment exception in ASC 740 on approximately $130 million of undistributed earnings of the U.S. Company and therefore, U.S. withholding taxes of approximately $39 million are not provided on those earnings. Our intentions are to utilize those earnings in the Company's U.S. operations due to debt service obligations and for other liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries that are owned directly and indirectly by the U.S. Company are not permanently reinvested and a deferred tax liability of $343 million related to those undistributed earnings was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014.
Inventory Valuation Methodology
Inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost or estimated net realizable value. We regularly review our inventories and write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Future demand is affected by market conditions, technological obsolescence, new products and strategic plans, each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning. In estimating obsolescence, we utilize our backlog information for the next 13 weeks as well as projecting future demand.
We balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We also consider pending cancellation of product lines due to technology changes, long life cycle products, lifetime buys at the end of supplier production runs, business exits and a shift of production to outsourcing.
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $62 million and $65 million, respectively, in reserves for inventory deemed obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand and for any inventory where the cost exceeds the estimated net realizable value. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and are recorded in cost of sales. The change in our reserves for inventory from 2014 to 2013 was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Restructuring Activities
We have undertaken, and may continue to undertake, significant restructuring initiatives which have required us, or may require us in the future, to implement plans to reduce our workforce, close facilities, discontinue product lines, refocus our business strategies and consolidate manufacturing, research and design centers and administrative operations. We initiate these plans in an effort to improve our operational effectiveness, reduce costs or simplify our product portfolio. The restructuring reserves include estimated payments for employee termination benefits, such as severance payments, and exit costs, such as termination fees associated with leases or other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities. Given the
significance and importance of successful execution of our restructuring activities, the complex process requires extensive reviews of plan estimates.
We operate in a highly cyclical industry; and therefore, we monitor and evaluate business conditions on a regular basis. At each reporting date, we evaluate our accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs to ensure that the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company unexpectedly and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. We reverse accruals to earnings when it is determined they are no longer required. In addition, we may incur additional charges for new plans or as a result of changes in estimates for plans previously recorded.
Following the appointment of Gregg Lowe as president and CEO of Freescale in 2012, we completed a detailed review of our strategic direction with the overall objective of identifying opportunities that would accelerate revenue growth and improve profitability. We recorded cash and non-cash charges of $30 million, $33 million and $52 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in connection with re-allocating research and development resources, re-aligning sales resources and making our operations more efficient. (Refer to Note 10, “Reorganization of Business and Other,” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the activities described in this section.)
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, which include our property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may trigger an impairment analysis for our long-lived assets include significant under-performance of the business, considerable negative industry or economic trends, major changes in our use of the asset and rapid technological changes. Management must make subjective judgments regarding the estimated future cash flows of the asset and its remaining useful life to determine if impairment is necessary. Additionally, if an impairment loss exists, the underlying facts used to determine the original charge may change or estimates may prove to be inaccurate, which could warrant additional impairment charges in future periods.
We determine the fair value of our intangible assets and PP&E in accordance with ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” Our impairment evaluation of identifiable intangible assets and PP&E includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over their remaining estimated useful lives. If the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the fair value. We determine fair value based on either market quotes, if available, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model for the specific asset being valued.
Major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future net sales and expenses and the discount rate associated with the asset. These estimates are based upon historical information and future projections for the Company. Different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation. If, as a result of our analysis, we determine that our intangible assets or PP&E has been impaired, we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.
The net book values of these tangible and intangible long-lived assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
Share-Based Compensation
We account for awards granted under our share-based employee compensation plans using the fair-value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC Topic 718”). These plans are more fully described in Note 6, “Employee Benefits and Incentive Plans” in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
In accordance with ASC Topic 718 and for purposes of determining share-based compensation expense, we estimated the fair values of non-qualified stock options granted under the 2011 Omnibus Plan, as amended and restated, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the weighted-average assumptions indicated below:
Due to our continued lack of extensive history as a public company, the computation of the expected volatility assumptions used in the Black-Scholes calculations for grants was based on historical volatilities and implied volatilities of our peer group companies. When establishing the expected life assumption, we used the “simplified” method prescribed in ASC Topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data. The risk-free interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption. We also must estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates. In addition, for certain of our performance-based awards, we must make subjective assumptions regarding the likelihood that the related performance metrics will be met. These assumptions are based on various operational and market results.
Also, we estimated the fair value of market-based restricted share units granted to certain executives awarded using the Monte Carlo valuation model, which includes a modifier for market results. The number of units that will vest will range from 0% to 150% of the target share awards based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company's share price as compared to a set of peer companies. The total compensation cost of these awards, net of forfeitures, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three years. The assumptions, in addition to projections of market results, used in the Monte Carlo model are outlined in the following table:
We evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in the ASU must be applied using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the effects, if any, adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
