SUMMARY OF MINEABLE (PROVEN AND PROBABLE) ORE RESERVES
Future production is contingent on available mineable ore reserves. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Ore reserves were estimated by the Company at December 31, 1997, using anticipated operating costs and C$495 (US$350) per ounce as the projected price of gold.
*Rounded to nearest thousand **Includes Nighthawk Mine
SUMMARY OF MINERALIZED MATERIAL
The following table presents mineralized material by property as of December 31, 1997. Mineralized material is estimated by the Company. This mineralized material has not been included in the mineable ore reserve estimates. Although the Company believes that adequate inspection, sampling and measurement has been done to indicate sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further exploration or development expenditures, these resources do not qualify under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission standards as commercially mineable orebodies until further drilling, metallurgical work, and other economic and technological feasibility factors based upon such work are resolved.
*Rounded to nearest thousand **Includes Nicholas Lake ***Includes Kim/Cass ****Includes Nighthawk Mine

BRITISH COLUMBIA DIVISION KEMESS SOUTH
BACKGROUND
The Kemess South project is located 182 miles northwest of Mackenzie, British Columbia, and to the east of Thutade Lake. Currently, access to the area is by air from Smithers or Prince George to the airstrip on site (a 5,225 foot gravel strip), and from the south by an all-weather private road from Fort St. James or Mackenzie.
In May 1993, the Company acquired 39% of Geddes Resources Limited ("Geddes"), a company whose only significant asset was a 100% interest in a block of mineral claims located in the vicinity of Windy Craggy mountain in northwestern British Columbia. In June 1993, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it would permanently protect,
as a provincial park, the region which included Windy Craggy, and would provide compensation for holders of mineral claims in the area. Subsequently, in December 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, which includes Windy Craggy, a World Heritage site.
In May 1995, the British Columbia provincial government commenced active negotiations with senior officers of Geddes pertaining to compensation respecting Windy Craggy. In order to facilitate such negotiations, the Company indicated to the British Columbia provincial government a willingness to purchase the Kemess and Red Mountain properties and to develop these properties, provided appropriate project support and investment arrangements were provided by the British Columbia provincial government.
In January 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of Geddes, El Condor Resources Ltd. ("El Condor") and St. Philips Resources Inc. ("St. Philips"). The remaining outstanding shares of Geddes were acquired for shares of the Company and cash with a total acquisition cost of $40.9 million; the outstanding shares of El Condor were acquired for shares of the Company and cash valued at $110.6 million; and the outstanding shares of St. Philips were acquired for $38.6 million in cash. El Condor and St. Philips owned the Kemess South property and El Condor owned the Kemess North property. These properties were owned by Kemess Mines Inc. (formerly Geddes Resources Limited) until its amalgamation with the Company on December 29, 1997. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the potential of the Kemess North property, there is presently no plan to develop this property until mining and milling operations are underway on the Kemess South property.
On April 29, 1996, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it had issued a Project Approval Certificate for the Kemess South project which entitled the Company to proceed with permitting applications for construction of a mine site and attendant infrastructure and since then, all of the necessary permits material to construction have been granted. Federal approval under the Environmental Assessment Act (Canada) and the Fisheries Act (Canada) was received on November 6, 1996, and will facilitate completion of all infrastructure impacting on viable lakes and streams in the project area.
TIMETABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT
Construction of the Kemess South project commenced in July 1996 and by mid-March 1998 was approximately 92% complete. Production is currently scheduled to commence in May 1998.
The engineering of the processing facilities, which commenced in November 1995, was completed in February of 1997. Teshmont Consultants Inc. of Winnipeg has managed construction of the power line and Knight Piesold Ltd. has designed the tailings dam.
COMPENSATION, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND INVESTMENT
The Company currently estimates that its total capital costs for the Kemess South project will be approximately $470 million plus the land acquisition cost of $202 million. The Company estimates that as of March 28, 1998, the Kemess South project was approximately 92% complete. For a discussion of the Company's current financial condition and cash position, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in Part II herein.
The project development has been partially facilitated by approximately $166 million of economic assistance, investment and compensation from the British Columbia provincial government as described below, of which approximately $154 million has been provided to date. The Company is not obligated to repay the British Columbia provincial government any of such amounts. Section 25 of the Financial Administration Act (British Columbia) provides that, notwithstanding the commitment to pay, any payment of money by the British Columbia provincial government pursuant to an agreement is subject to (i) an appropriation being available for that agreement in the year in which the payment falls due and (ii) the Treasury Board not having controlled or limited expenditure under any such appropriation.
The compensation, financial assistance and investment of up to $166 million to be provided by the British Columbia provincial government consist of the following components described below:
(i) Compensation - $29 million payable over two years. On April 15, 1996, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Kemess Mines Inc., received the first of two equal compensation payments of $14.5 million. The final payment was made in April 1997.
(ii) Royalty interest investment - $50 million to develop on and off-site mine infrastructure for the Kemess South project. The Company will pay the British Columbia provincial government a royalty of 4.8% on the value of all copper extracted and processed from the Kemess South project.
(iii) Power line installation - $49 million payable over three years to cover the cost of constructing a 380 kilometre power line from the Kennedy substation to the Kemess South project site together with related equipment. The Company is evaluating alternate sources to supply the power. The power line will be owned and operated by the Company for at least 20 years.
(iv) Regional resource infrastructure - $14 million payable over 14 years for emergency health facilities, airport facilities and for developing and maintaining a connector road.
(v) Human resource development program - $4.0 million payable over two years to facilitate recruitment, selection, relocation, mobility, training, upgrading and safety training for personnel working at the Kemess South project.
(vi) Mining development - $20 million to be matched dollar for dollar for the development of properties in British Columbia, including the Kemess and Red Mountain properties and extensions.
(vii) Facilitation and support - The British Columbia provincial government agreed to facilitate and support the Company with respect to the negotiation of appropriate contracts of rail transport, port and power charges and to facilitate the review and consideration of the development of the orebody and construction of mining and processing facilities relating to the project pursuant to all applicable legislative, environmental, permitting and other governmental requirements.
The compensation, financial assistance and investment outlined above are documented in a formal written agreement that was signed in June 1997.
OWNERSHIP
The Kemess South property consists of 189 staked mineral claims and a mineral lease in two distinct groups that cover approximately 66,530 acres. The Kemess South property was owned by El Condor and St. Philips, and the Kemess North property was owned by El Condor. The property was transferred to Kemess Mines Inc. pursuant to the winding up of El Condor and St. Philips. Kemess Mines Inc. and the Company amalgamated on December 29, 1997. The Company will pay the British Columbia provincial government a royalty of 4.8% on the value of all copper extracted and processed from the Kemess South project. In addition, there are two royalty agreements that affect a small number of claims. At December 31, 1997, the net book value of the Kemess mine properties and property, plant and equipment was approximately $202 million and $318 million, respectively.
GEOLOGY
The Kemess South deposit is a large low grade gold-copper porphyry-type deposit. It is hosted by a flat-lying porphyritic quartz monzodiorite intrusion. Pyrite, the dominant sulphide, occurs as veins and fracture coatings accompanying quartz stringers. Chalcopyrite occurs as disseminated grains and in quartz stockwork veins. Native gold is included within or is peripheral to grains of chalcopyrite, and gold grades correlate closely with those of copper in the hypogene zone.
The highest grade of gold and copper mineralization correlate with zones of intense quartz stockwork development.
A supergene zone, comprising 20% of the deposit, formed during a period of weathering synchronous with the formation of the Late Cretaceous Sustut Basin. Copper grades within this zone are locally leached or enriched, while gold concentrations remain relatively unchanged. Native copper is the dominant secondary copper mineral except at the base of the supergene zone where chalcocite becomes increasingly abundant.
MINING AND MILLING
The development plan contemplates that the deposit will be mined at an average rate of approximately 107,000 tpd at an estimated cost of $1.73 per ton of ore. Milling at the rate of approximately 50,000 tpd is projected to cost approximately $1.98 per ton of ore. At this mining rate, the life of the project is estimated to be approximately 16 years. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
ORE RESERVES
Ore reserves for the Kemess South project were calculated by the Company in February 1997 and revised for December 1997 to reflect changes in gold and copper prices. Reserves for this property are estimated at 232 million tons of ore averaging 0.018 opt of gold and 0.215% copper. These reserve estimates contain allowances for mining losses and dilution, but not for losses in milling. Net smelter return calculations were carried out on mineralization at Kemess South in order to determine the value that would be returned from mining and processing. These estimates included all transportation, smelter and refining charges. The prices of gold and copper used in the above feasibility studies were US$350 per ounce and US$0.95 per pound, respectively, with an exchange rate of US$0.70/Cdn$1.00.
RED MOUNTAIN
BACKGROUND
The Red Mountain project area is located in the Coastal Mountain Range, 11 miles east of the seaport of Stewart, in northwestern British Columbia. Currently, access to the property is by helicopter from Stewart, however, a road has been constructed to a potential portal site in Bitter Creek adjacent to the ore zone but at a lower elevation.
OWNERSHIP
The property consists of 132 staked mining claims that cover 85,267 acres. The Company acquired 100% of the Red Mountain property from Barrick Gold for one dollar and the obligation to spend $3 million on the property. The Company assumed all past environmental liabilities, estimated at $3.0 million, as part of this purchase. The Company expended $8.0 million on a surface and underground development program which was completed in late 1996, thereby fulfilling its expenditure obligation. Further development of the project has been postponed due to low gold prices. The prior owner is entitled to receive a 1% net smelter return royalty on all production from a portion of the property, and on production over 1.85 million ounces of gold, an additional $10.00 per ounce of gold is payable. In addition, the Company is required to pay a 2.5% net smelter return royalty to a third party.
GEOLOGY
The Red Mountain orebody is a hydrothermal gold deposit related to a multiphase intrusion. The Red Mountain area is underlain by Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Hazelton Group. Early Jurassic plutons, sills and dykes have intruded this volcanic-sedimentary assemblage, the largest of which (the Goldslide-Hillslide intrusion) lies beneath Red Mountain. The orebody currently consists of three northwest plunging, southwest dipping elliptical zones located beneath the summit approximately at the contact between two phases of the Goldslide intrusion and hosted within both the stratified sediments and the Hillslide intrusion. Both the ore zones and the host rocks have been disrupted by northwest plunging folds and at least two phases of brittle faulting.
An extensive surface and underground drilling program was completed in 1996. The drilling showed that the JW Zone was truncated to the north by faulting or folding. However, drilling intersected Red Mountain type mineralization closer to the valley floor within a zone now called the SF Zone situated 1,000 feet below and 1,000 feet due north of the JW Zone. The short field season prevented sufficient drilling to fully define the SF Zone's extent and grade. No site work was undertaken in 1997. All permits have been maintained in good standing and routine environmental sampling was carried out.
MINING AND MILLING
It is estimated that over US$30 million was spent by former owners of this property, Lac Minerals and Barrick Gold, between 1991 and 1994 outlining and developing the Marc, AV and JW Zones, which included 300,000 feet of drilling. These zones remain open down-plunge and the exploration potential for the area north of the deposit is deemed by the Company to be excellent.
The Red Mountain deposit requires significant further exploration, ore reserve, and development work before production can commence.
ORE RESERVES
800,000 ounces of gold grading 0.262 opt gold previously reported in the mineable category for the Red Mountain project have been reclassified as mineralized material and are no longer included as part of mineable ore reserves.
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES DIVISION
COLOMAC MINE
SELECTED OPERATING DATA
* Mine reopened. **In 1994 revenue from production at Colomac was netted against start-up costs and the difference was deferred as pre-production costs.
BACKGROUND
The Colomac Mine, which is located approximately 137 miles northwest of Yellowknife in the vicinity of Indin Lake, was acquired in April 1993 from Neptune Resources Corp. ("Neptune") after having been shut down in June 1991. Stripping operations at the Colomac Mine recommenced in March 1993, and the first gold production was realized in July 1994. Operations at the Colomac Mine were suspended in December 1997 and clean-up operations are currently underway in preparation for placing the facilities on care and maintenance. The property is accessible by winter road from Yellowknife for approximately three months each year and on a year round basis by chartered aircraft to a 5,000 foot airstrip at the mine site.
OWNERSHIP
The Company is currently seeking to option or joint venture the Colomac property which contains approximately 100 square miles of mineral rights and includes the more advanced areas detailed below. The Colomac property is comprised of 4 mining leases and 3 surface leases which cover approximately 3,400 acres. In 1993, the Company acquired the Colomac Mine and surrounding properties in exchange for the Company's Common Shares valued at $7,875,000. In a simultaneous transaction, the Company acquired the gross production royalty on the Colomac property in exchange for the Company's Common Shares valued at $4,000,000. The Company holds a 100% interest in the leases. The mining leases are subject to an operating royalty payable to Neptune, when the average price of gold for a calendar year exceeds US$400 per ounce. Amounts payable are $1.0 million or $2.0 million annually depending on the average price of gold. No amount has been payable under this royalty to date. Obligations under this agreement expire after five years of production. The net book value of the Colomac property, plant and equipment was approximately $11.9 million as of December 31, 1997.
The Kim/Cass property consists of 12 leased mining claims covering approximately 15,310 acres and is accessible from Colomac by an all-weather road that was constructed in 1996.
In 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Echo Bay Mines Ltd. ("Echo Bay") as operator of a joint venture pursuant to which the Company was granted an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Kim/Cass property, exclusive of diamond rights, if the Company placed the property into production within four years. Subsequently, a dispute arose as to whether other members of the joint venture had consented to the option agreement. The Company believes it has resolved the matter by reaching agreement with Echo Bay, to be set forth in a final written agreement, by which Echo Bay will transfer its 75% interest in the Kim/Cass property, exclusive of diamond rights, to the Company in consideration of the Company's $1 million in expenditures made on the property, subject to sliding scale net smelter return royalty based on the price of gold.
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Colomac Mine is designed to use conventional open pit mining techniques. The mill, built in 1989, is a conventional 9,300 tpd CIP circuit with historical recoveries of approximately 88%. The mill circuitry was modified, including installation of a pebble crusher bypass in 1996, to overcome operating difficulties and to facilitate the processing of 10,000 tpd of ore. The plant and equipment are generally in good to excellent condition. The power for this property is diesel-generated on site.
GEOLOGY
The Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Pre-Cambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Kim/Cass zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides.
ORE RESERVES
Due to the suspension of operations in 1997, no portion of the Colomac dyke is included as part of mineable reserves. Similarly, none of the Kim/Cass property is included as part of mineable reserves and instead has been reclassified to the mineralized material category.
GIANT MINE
SELECTED OPERATING DATA
BACKGROUND
The Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in continuous production since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all-weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the center of the property. Mining is conducted underground and the ore is processed with an on-site mill. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7.6 million ounces of gold.
In 1996 the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure which accesses the Supercrest orebody and large scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 opt gold in situ compared to 0.301 ounces of gold per ton at Giant. The net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $57.2 million as of December 31, 1997.
The Nicholas Lake property, which was acquired in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife. It can be accessed by chartered aircraft from Yellowknife or by winter road. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements."
OWNERSHIP
The Company owns 100% interest in the Giant Mine property, consisting of 32 mining leases covering 3,050 acres and one surface lease covering 2,243 acres.
The Company purchased 100% interest in the Nicholas Lake property in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., for $3.8 million. The Nicholas Lake property is subject to a 1% net smelter return production royalty and a $10,000 per year minimum advance royalty.
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Giant Mine operates as an underground mine with access provided by two large service raises, five declines and the "C" shaft, which is the principal operating opening for hoisting, extending to a depth of 2,124 feet. Mining is by conventional underground mining techniques such as cut and fill. The mine is mechanized with jumbo drills and 3-1/2 yard scooptrams. The mill at the Giant Mine is a 1,100 tpd milling and refining complex. The mine and mill operate on a seven day a week schedule. The power source for this property is Northwest Territories Power Corp. Power costs have increased significantly in the last several years and the Company is investigating alternative sources of providing power.
The Nicholas Lake orebody consists of eleven zones of mineralization. These zones are near vertical quartz-sulphide veins. The zones have been drilled from surface and underground at a spacing of approximately 65 feet. The orebody is accessed by a ramp (driven in 1994) to a depth of 300 feet below surface. A total of 750 feet of cross-cutting and silling has been conducted on two of the major zones (including detailed mapping and sampling).
The main infrastructure of the Giant Mine has been in place since 1946. An Edwards Hearth roaster was constructed in 1948 and a fluid bed roaster was added in 1950. In the mid-1950's, a two-stage fluid bed roaster was added along with a roaster gas cleaning plant. In the early 1980's, a new effluent treatment plant was added, and in 1992 to 1994, the mill's flotation cells were replaced. The Company's fluid bed roaster currently operates in compliance with all existing legislation and regulations. The Giant Mine's plant and equipment are generally in good condition.
GEOLOGY
The Giant Mine is in the Yellowknife Greenstone belt, a package of Precambrian basic volcanic rocks. Orebodies are hosted in shear zones within the greenstones. Individual orebodies are veins, quartz lenses, or silicified areas within the shear. Gold is associated with fine-grained arsenopyrite.
The Nicholas Lake deposit is a series of narrow, steeply dipping quartz veins containing gold, arsenopyrite and other sulphides. These veins occur within a granitic intrusive body.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1997, the Giant Mine had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of approximately 930,000 tons grading 0.357 ounces of gold per ton. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on current mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
Material previously reported in the mineable reserve category for Nicholas Lake has been reclassified as mineralized material and is not included as part of mineable reserves.
REGULATIONS
Operations at both the Colomac and Giant mines are governed by Federal and Territorial statutes, ordinances and regulations. Included under Northwest Territorial jurisdiction are the Apprentices and Tradesmen Regulations, the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Regulations, Business License Fire Regulations, Explosive Use Regulations, Fire Prevention Act, Labour Standards Ordinance, the Northwest Territories Mining Safety Act, Workers Compensation Act, Public Health Ordinance, Emergency Measures Act and Environmental Protection Ordinance. Under Federal jurisdiction are the Clean Air Act, the Fisheries Act, Northwest Territories Waters Act, Territorial Lands Act, Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and the Canada Mining Regulations. Failure to comply may result in cease work orders and/or fines. The Company believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any orders or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
ONTARIO DIVISION
TIMMINS OPERATIONS
SELECTED OPERATING DATA - ONTARIO DIVISION
BACKGROUND
The Pamour Mine consists of two underground (Pamour and Hoyle) and two open pit mining operations. The Pamour Mine is located approximately 15 miles east of the City of Timmins, Ontario, and has been in production since 1936. Both the Pamour and Hoyle properties are transected by Highway 101. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1936, the Pamour Mine has produced in excess of 4.1 million ounces of gold. The net book value of the Company's property, plant and equipment in the Timmins operations which includes 31,878 acres of exploration land, including those associated with the Pamour, Hoyle and Nighthawk properties, was approximately $81.9 million as of December 31, 1997.
OWNERSHIP
The Pamour property consists of 38 patented mining claims, 3 staked claims and one License of Occupation. Together, the property covers approximately 1,651 acres of mining rights and 1,575 acres of surface rights. Directly adjacent to the Pamour Mine is the Hoyle property that is comprised of 37 patented mining claims and 4 leased claims covering approximately 1,608 acres. The Company has a renewable 10-year lease on that portion of the Hoyle property lying south of the Timiskaming Unconformity where current mining operations are conducted. The lease terms include the payment of a minimum annual rent of $100,000 which is credited against a production royalty being the higher of $0.75 per ton or a 2% net smelter return. In order to renew the lease, which expires in 1999, for a further 10-year term, the Company must spend $1.0 million on exploration and mine one million tons of ore. Both conditions have been satisfied and as a result the Company is entitled to an automatic renewal of the lease. The Company has earned a 51% interest in the portion of the Hoyle property north of the Timiskaming Unconformity, which is not currently in production.
MINING AND MILLING
The Pamour Mine currently operates both open pit and underground mining operations. The underground operations currently produce approximately 1,500 tpd of ore, while the open pit operations produce approximately 1,500 tpd. The Pamour Mine is comprised of the Pamour No. 1 Underground Mine, surface pits and the Hoyle Mine.
The Pamour No. 1 Underground Mine commenced operations in 1936 as the original Pamour Mine and has operated continuously since. The leased Hoyle Mine extension, which commenced production in April 1990, is the eastern strike extension of the Pamour orebody and is a large resource of bulk mineable conglomerate ore which has been accessed by a decline from surface and by underground drifts from the Pamour shaft. The underground mine currently produces approximately 1,500 tpd through a 3,145 foot deep five-compartment timbered shaft. The Hoyle property has the capacity to produce 50,000 tons per month. The mine is adjacent to the Pamour No. 1 operation and has higher grade ore than present reserves at the Pamour No. 1 Mine.
Where possible, bulk mining methods are utilized, primarily by modified vertical crater retreat as well as sub-level blasthole stoping. The bulk mining areas are developed with large mechanized drill jumbos, scooptrams and trucks. Scooptrams and trucks move the blasted ore from the drawpoints to an internal pass. An electric trolley with 5 ton cars transports the ore from the internal pass to 3 Shaft where it is skipped to the surface. Higher grade, narrow veins are mined by a modified open shrinkage method. The ore is developed and mined with jacklegs and stopers which drill 1-1/4 inch blast holes. The broken ore is transported to the shaft by mechanized scoops, trucks and/or electric trains and then hoisted to the surface.
The No. 3 Pit is located immediately southeast of the Pamour Mill. This open pit was developed over the upper workings of the Pamour Mine and first came into production in 1985. The No. 5 Pit, at the extreme west end of the Pamour No. 1 property, was brought into production in 1989. Total pit production is 1,500 tons of ore per day.
An additional jaw crusher was added to the Pamour Mine in the early 1990's. In 1995, all 25-cycle electrical motors in the mine were replaced due to the change in the power supply from 25 cycles to 60 cycles. Also in 1995, an additional ball mill was installed to increase capacity from 3,600 tpd to 4,000 tpd. The on-site mill at Pamour has the capacity to treat approximately 4,000 tpd. A gold pyrite flotation concentrate is produced from the ore and is treated by a conventional cyanidation process to produce a gold precipitate which is refined into dore. The Pamour Mine plant and equipment are generally in good condition. The power source for this property is Ontario Hydro.
PAMOUR MINE EXPANSION
As a result of its successful exploration program from 1994 to 1996, the Company began developing a significant expansion project at the Pamour property by focusing on developing ore reserves in a low grade halo around mined out stopes at the Pamour property. The current dimensions of the ultimate pit are approximately 6,000 feet long, 2,400 feet wide and 1,000 feet deep. In 1997, preliminary studies of mining and milling operations, together with an environmental study, were conducted. In the fall of 1997, due to low gold prices and the need to conserve cash to complete construction of the Kemess South project, further development of this project was postponed. For additional information see discussion under "Pamour Expansion" contained in "Ontario Division" in "Review of Operations" above.
GEOLOGY
The Pamour Mine is located approximately one mile north of the Destor-Porcupine Fault, an east-northeast to west-southwest striking structure. The majority of the historic gold producing mines in the Porcupine Gold Camp have been located near this structure. On the property, a series of basic volcanic rocks are unconformably overlain by greywackes and a thick conglomerate, known as the Pamour conglomerate. All rocks are of the Precambrian age. Gold occurs in narrow high grade quartz veins in the volcanics and in the sediments. The majority of the gold that has been mined from this property occurs in sheeted sets of quartz veins in the Pamour conglomerate and in the greywackes on either side of it. Gold also occurs in broad irregular zones of quartz veinlets in the volcanic rocks.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1997, the Pamour Mine had mineable (proven and probable) ore reserves of approximately 26,369,000 tons grading 0.042 opt gold. Estimated mineable ore reserves at this division have decreased this year due to the reclassification of a portion of the open pit reserves to mineralized material as a result of lower gold prices. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on current mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
NIGHTHAWK
BACKGROUND
The Nighthawk Mine, which was operated by Porcupine Peninsular Gold Mines Limited between 1924 and 1927, is located east of the Pamour Mine and reopened production in September 1995. Access is via highway, 10 miles from the Pamour Mill.
OWNERSHIP
The Company's land holdings in the Nighthawk Lake area are extensive with approximately 12,797 acres held representing 265 claims. Most of the property is held outright by the Company as staked claims. Other portions are held through various option agreements which also provide for some form of production royalty. The Ronnoco claims on the east peninsula of the lake are held through a subsidiary company, Ronnoco Gold Mines Limited. The current producing deposit, the Nighthawk Mine, is located on the north peninsula of the lake and is subject to a production royalty being the higher of (i) $0.003 times tons mined times dollars per ounce of gold or (ii) 20% of the net profits.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
During the period from 1924 to 1927, the Nighthawk Mine produced 99,628 tons of ore grading 0.32 ounces of gold per ton. Additional exploration was done periodically over the ensuing years. The Company developed the Nighthawk Mine and began production in September 1995. Current production is 900 tpd from the Nighthawk Mine.
The orebody is accessed by a ramp that will ultimately be driven to 750 feet below surface. Mining methods for this underground mine are primarily longhole open stoping, with 50 feet between sublevels. Waste rock will be placed in stopes as delayed backfill. Ore is hauled to surface stockpiles in 30 ton dump trucks. The material is then hauled by truck 10 miles to the Pamour Mill for processing. The mine's equipment is generally in excellent condition. The power source for this property is Ontario Hydro.
GEOLOGY
The Nighthawk Mine is adjacent to a major structure called the Nighthawk Break, which is thought to be a splay off of the Destor-Porcupine Fault. The geology in this area consists mainly of steeply dipping volcanic flows. In the mine area, these have undergone intensive carbonate alteration. Gold occurs in quartz veins and silicified zones associated with minor amounts of sulphide minerals.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1997, the Nighthawk properties had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of 2,920,000 tons grading 0.059 ounces of gold per ton. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances were made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.

The Matachewan site is located approximately 56 miles southeast of the City of Timmins, Ontario and is accessed directly by Provincial Highway 566. The main area of interest is the site of two former producing mines located west of the Town of Matachewan.
The Matachewan property was mined from 1933 to 1957 by Matachewan Consolidated Mines and Young-Davidson Mines and produced an aggregate of 956,117 ounces of gold grading 0.10 ounces per ton from both underground and open pit sources.
In 1997, the Company conducted a program of dewatering and rehabilitation of the Matachewan Consolidated Mine #3 Shaft to facilitate underground exploration of the existing mine and extensions of the deposit. Extensive design of facilities and infrastructure related to the final mining and milling plant was also undertaken. These activities progressed until August 1997, when due to declining gold prices, the Company placed the project on care and maintenance.
The #3 shaft has been dewatered and rehabilitated to the 1,200-foot level of the 2,450-foot deep shaft. The mine is being maintained in this partially dewatered state until such time as market conditions improve. There is currently no schedule for the resumption of dewatering and exploration activities at the site.
All permits for this advanced exploration phase are being kept in good standing during this period. Federal permits for the production phase are still in the review process under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. It is anticipated that this approval will be granted in the spring of 1998, as previously projected.
The development plan envisages a 5,000-tpd milling facility (relocated from the Hope Brook Mine) with annual production in excess of 100,000 ounces.
OWNERSHIP
The Matachewan property is held under two lease agreements. The lease agreement with Matachewan Consolidated Mines Limited provides for advanced royalty payments of $15,000 per year or rent of $7,500 per year, depending on the current
gold price. The Young Davidson lease agreement provides for advance royalty payments of approximately $40,000 per year. The property is subject to a minimum 3% net smelter return royalty.
GEOLOGY
The Matachewan deposit is hosted within a syenite body which has intruded along and near the highly deformed contact between Timiskaming Group sedimentary rocks and Larder Lake Group volcanic rocks. The main syenite body is approximately 2,460 feet long, 410 feet wide and dips steeply to the south.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1997, the Matachewan property had mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of 10,549,000 tons grading 0.058 opt gold. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
DUPORT
BACKGROUND
The Duport property is located on Shoal Lake, 28 miles southwest of the town of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, in the Lake of the Woods District. The development ramp is located on an island and is accessible by barge.
OWNERSHIP
Intermittent exploration of the Duport deposit was carried out by various parties from 1930 to 1950, including underground exploration. In 1973, Consolidated Professor Mines Limited obtained an option on the Duport property and conducted an extensive sampling and drilling program from 1973 to 1974. Subsequently, this option was exercised and Consolidated Professor acquired a 100% interest in this property after amalgamating with Duport Mining Company Limited. The Company completed the acquisition of all of the shares of Consolidated Professor in May 1996 pursuant to a tender offer followed by a compulsory acquisition. There is a royalty payable to Union Carbide Canada Limited ("Union Carbide") equivalent to a 50% net profits interest until recovery of pre-production expenditures, up to a maximum of $2.0 million. Thereafter, Union Carbide will receive a 10% net profits interest until a maximum of $5.0 million in the aggregate has been paid. The Company also has a right, subject to certain terms and conditions, to buy back the royalty upon payment of a certain sum.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
The Duport project is situated in the environmentally sensitive area of Shoal Lake, the source of Winnipeg, Manitoba's residential and commercial water supply. Environmental concerns were raised in 1989 by local cottagers and the City of Winnipeg, after Consolidated Professor announced its plans to advance the project to the permitting stage. The main concern was the perception of potential environmental hazards associated with the processing of the refractory gold ore and the disposal of cyanide treated tailings. During the past six years, impact and sensitivity studies have been conducted by Consolidated Professor related to these concerns. As a result of the Company's purchase, all aspects of mining, ore transport, milling, tailings disposal and site reclamation are being reconsidered with the objective of satisfying all concerned parties. Among other features, the redesigned development plan will involve transporting the ore by truck to the mainland via a year-round ferry to a mill site located 5.2 miles in land, outside of the Shoal Lake watershed. The new design concept effectively addressed every concern brought forth during the consultation process. The Company has completed a fisheries study in the potential tailings area in the Squaw Lake watershed. The Company plans to conduct studies to revise mining and milling concepts as part of a preliminary feasibility study on the Duport project. However, the project has been suspended due to low gold prices.
GEOLOGY
The northern end of the Lake of the Woods District is underlain by the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of an extensive Keewatin greenstone belt. In the general Shoal Lake area, two granodiorite intrusions, namely, the Canoe Lake Stock and the Snowshoe Bay Stock, intrude the greenstone belt assemblage and are separated by a five mile broad section of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. Within this volcanic pile is a wide deformation zone which hosts the gold mineralized zones of the Duport project which occur as en echelon lenses within highly sheared felsic tuffs.
ORE RESERVES
The Duport project has mineable ore reserves (proven and probable) of approximately 1,008,000 tons grading 0.38 opt gold. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.

NEWFOUNDLAND DIVISION
HOPE BROOK MINE
SELECTED OPERATING DATA - NEWFOUNDLAND DIVISION
BACKGROUND
The Hope Brook Mine is located approximately 5 miles inland from the southwest coast of Newfoundland, between the towns of Burgeo and Port aux Basques. Reserves and resources were depleted during 1997 which resulted in closure of the mine in September 1997.
OWNERSHIP
For five years, production from the Hope Brook Mine was subject to an operating royalty ranging from $1.3 million to $3.3 million annually in favor of the prior owner when the annual average spot price of gold exceeded US$380 per ounce. In 1996, the year in which the royalty expired, the royalty paid was $1.3 million. The Hope Brook Mine area consists of a 25-year mining lease, surface lease and extended exploration licenses which cover approximately 6,800 acres of mining rights and 490 acres of surface rights. The Company holds a 100% interest in the property, and all mining activities are confined to the mining leases.
MINING AND MILLING
The mine was shut down in 1997 and the Company currently plans to move the mill to Matachewan as increases in gold prices justify. The mill is currently on care and maintenance.
GEOLOGY
Gold mineralization occurs in an alteration zone of pervasive silica, pyrite, and pyrophyllite which is approximately 4 kilometers long and 300 meters wide. The alteration zone exists within a mixed volcanic-sedimentary sequence. The Hope Brook orebody is located in the zone of alteration. Ore covers a strike length of 500 meters and extends from surface to a depth of 400 meters dipping steeply at an angle of seventy-five degrees.
ORE RESERVES
With the suspension of mining operations, the material inventory for the Hope Brook Mine is no longer included as part of mineable reserves.
REGULATIONS
The Newfoundland Division is governed by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Occupational Health and Safety Act, Department of Environment and Lands Act, The Mineral Act, Waste Material Act, the Regulation of Mines Act, and the Government of Canada's Fisheries Act and Environmental Protection Act, and all regulations passed thereunder. Failure to comply therewith can result in cease work orders and/or fines. The Company believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any order or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
UNITED STATES DIVISION
COPPERSTONE MINE
BACKGROUND
In June 1995, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the Copperstone property. The Copperstone property is located 20 miles north of Quartzsite and 60 miles south of Lake Havasu City in La Paz County, Arizona.
OWNERSHIP
The Copperstone property is held by the Company, under a renewable 10 year lease agreement and consists of 284 unpatented mining claims totaling 5,680 acres and 2 state leases covering 1,338 acres located in La Paz County, Arizona.
The Company is obligated to pay an advance minimum royalty annually of US$30,000 against a minimum 1% gross production royalty, and must spend US$1 million by the year 2000. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had expended approximately US$1.4 million.
MINING AND MILLING
Since late 1995, the Company has drilled in excess of 32,000 feet in 34 dual- purpose RC/Core holes to investigate the continuity and extent of auriferous, north-plunging shoots below the Copperstone pit. The Company believes that excellent potential exists for the discovery of a well-focused, moderate sized, high-grade underground gold deposit. Several multi-ounce gold intercepts, including 2.04 opt gold over a core length of 25 feet have been intersected up to 600 feet north of the Copperstone pit. The mineralization in the D Zone is entirely oxide ore, is hosted in an intensely silicified and brecciated, semi- massive specularite-magnetite altered limestone unit, and appears extremely dense for gold ore.
The contoured grade thickness data suggest a periodicity of north-plunging auriferous shoots spaced about 300 feet apart. A predictable pattern of ore shoot geometry is being used successfully to optimize results in drilling for gold. The Company believes that there is very good potential for the discovery of additional gold-bearing shoots north of the present drill coverage.
Previous drilling by Cyprus Gold Corp. encountered high-grade gold values over significant widths from a parallel structure in the footwall below the pit floor. The intercept includes 0.646 opt gold over a core length of 15 feet and 0.268 opt gold over a core length of 40 feet.
GEOLOGY
Gold mineralization is confined to a moderately dipping, brecciated fault structure that cuts quartz latite welded tuff and limestone units. Potassium metasomatism has affected all of the feldspar-bearing rocks at Copperstone. This is believed to be a consequence of potassium-rich (evaporite) brines circulating downward in half-grabens developed during regional extension by detachment faults. Mineralization is present in the main breccia structure and is accompanied by metasomatic alkali depletion (potassium and sodium loss) and silica, iron, manganese and barium addition. The highest gold values are associated with quartz, specular hematite and chrysocolla.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1997, the Copperstone project had mineable (proven and probable) of 455,000 tons grading 0.486 ounces of gold per ton. Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances were made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling.
INTERNATIONAL DIVISION NAMOSI PROJECT
BACKGROUND
The Namosi property comprises 178,000 acres and is located 30 km northwest of Suva, the capital of Fiji.
In April 1997, the Company received consent from the Fijian government for the transfer of Namosi mining tenements SPL 1352 and SPL 1367 from Placer Pacific Namosi Ltd ("Placer"). Following this consent, the Company, through its wholly- owned subsidiary, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc., received certification from the Registrar of Companies to carry out business as a foreign company in Fiji.
OWNERSHIP
Approval of the Namosi licenses was granted in August 1997 and as a result, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc. was granted the right to carry out exploration and related activities on the properties throughout 1998.
MINING AND MILLING
A detailed search for porphyry copper deposits began in 1968 when Australian Anglo American (Fiji) Pty Ltd. acquired the property. Between 1970 and 1990, various consortia conducted various exploration activities. Viti Copper Ltd. managed the project during the prefeasibility stage. Over 164,000 feet of drilling was completed and feasibility studies indicated material grading at 0.43% copper for the two main Waisoi deposits.
From 1986 to 1989, Anglo Pacific Namosi Ltd. and Western Mining Corporation carried out exploration programs aimed at assessing the gold potential at the major prospects and in the vein systems peripheral to the porphyry copper deposits. In 1991, renewed investigations were begun by Placer and included 39 drill holes at Waisoi and 8 holes at Wainabama. Placer conducted a detailed economic study of the Waisoi deposit and concluded that the project required further geological exploration success to achieve viability.
GEOLOGY
The major porphyry copper prospects are at Waisoi, Wainabama, Waivaka Corridor and Wainadoi, and there are a number of polymetallic vein and skarn systems around the periphery. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with high level intrusion of Wainamala tuffs and Namosi andesites. The main controls on porphyry intrusions are northeast and north northwest trending faults related to regional tectonics. High copper and gold values occur in the cupola region of the stocks and around brecciated, faulted and stockworked haloes.
ORE RESERVES
No portion of the Namosi property is included as part of mineable reserves. The most significant deposit is Waisoi, which is estimated to contain over 1 billion tons grading 0.43% copper and 0.004 opt gold equivalent to approximately 9 billion pounds of contained copper and 4 million ounces of contained gold.
When implemented, a Phase I program will consist of grid work, geological mapping, geophysical surveying, rock and soil sampling and multi-element analysis, dual purpose RC / core drilling and environmental baseline studies.
