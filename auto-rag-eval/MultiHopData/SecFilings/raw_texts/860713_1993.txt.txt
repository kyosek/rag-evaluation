ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
The Company's reserves are concentrated in several major producing areas. These include the Wattenberg Field in Colorado, central and southern Wyoming, the Piceance and Uinta Basins in the Western Slope of Colorado and Utah, the Giddings area in South Texas, the Spraberry Trend in West Texas, waterflood units in Texas, and the Appalachian Basin in eastern Ohio and Pennsylvania. See "Significant Properties."
At December 31, 1993, the Company had interests in 5,122 gross (2,187 net) producing oil and gas wells located in 15 states and in the Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 1993, estimated proved reserves totalled 31.9 million barrels of oil and 430.1 Bcf of gas. In addition to its oil and gas reserves, the Company holds interests in nine gas transportation and processing facilities. See "Business - - Gas Management."
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated yearend proved reserves for the three years ended December 31, 1993.
The following table sets forth pretax future net revenues from the production of proved reserves and the Pretax PW10% Value of such revenues.
The quantities and values in the preceding tables are based on prices in effect at December 31, 1993, averaging $12.54 per barrel of oil and $2.27 per Mcf of gas. Price reductions decrease reserve values by lowering the future net revenues attributable to the reserves and will reduce the quantities of reserves that are recoverable on an economic basis. Price increases have the opposite effect. Any significant decline in prices of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
Future prices received for such production and future production costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be developed within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. With respect to certain properties that historically have experienced seasonal curtailment, the reserve estimates assume that the seasonal pattern of such curtailment will continue in the future. There can be no assurance that actual production will equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections.
The present values shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate, and present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties operated by the Company, expenses exclude the Company's share of overhead charges. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things, general and administrative costs and interest expense.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil and gas reserve engineering must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way, and estimates of other engineers might differ materially from those shown above. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often materially different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI"), independent petroleum consultants, prepared estimates of or audited the Company's proved reserves which collectively represent more than 80% of Pretax PW10% Value as of December 31, 1993. Approximately 38% of the yearend Pretax PW10% Value was estimated internally by the Company and 62% was estimated independently by NSAI. No estimates of the Company's reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC.
Producing Wells
The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 1993 relating to the producing wells in which the Company owned a working interest. The Company also held royalty interests in 240 producing wells. Wells are classified as oil or gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
Acreage
The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 1993 relating to acreage held by the Company. Undeveloped acreage is all a acreage held under lease, permit, contract, or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for development or exploratory drilling.
Significant Properties
Although the Company's properties are widely dispersed geographically, emphasis has been placed on establishing "hubs" in certain producing basins. Interests in five producing areas accounted for approximately 90% of Pretax PW10% Value at December 31, 1993. This concentration of assets results in economic efficiencies in the management of assets and permits identification of complementary acquisition candidates. Summary information regarding reserve concentrations and more detailed information regarding the four most significant properties are set forth below.
On March 9, 1994, the closing price of the common stock was $19-1/2. Dividends were paid quarterly at the rate of $.05 per share in 1992. Due to revised payment timing, two payments were made at the $.05 rate in the second quarter of 1992. Dividends were paid at the rate of $.05 per share in the first and second quarter of 1993. In the third quarter of 1993, dividends were increased to $.06 per share. Shares of common stock receive dividends as, if and when declared by the Board of Directors. The amount of future dividends will depend on debt service requirements, dividend requirements on the Company's preferred stock, capital expenditures and other factors. On December 31, 1993, there were approximately 3,500 holders of record of the common stock and 23.3 million shares outstanding.
On March 9, 1994 the closing price of the $4 Convertible Preferred Stock was $106. Shares of $4 Convertible Preferred Stock receive quarterly dividends of $1.00 if declared by the Board of Directors. Any cumulative dividends in arrears must be paid prior to payment of any dividends on the common stock. On December 31, 1993, there were 24 holders of record of the $4 Convertible Preferred Stock and 1.2 million shares outstanding. The $4 Convertible Preferred Stock may be called beginning on January 1, 1995 at a price of $52.50 per share.
On March 9, 1994 the closing price of the depositary shares representing the $6 Convertible Preferred Stock was $27-7/8. Each depositary share represents a one-quarter interest in a share of $100 liquidation value $6 Convertible Preferred Stock. Shares of $6 Convertible Preferred Stock receive quarterly dividends of $1.50 ($.375 per depositary share) if declared by the Board of Directors. A dividend was paid June 30, 1993 at the rate of $1.17 per share ($.29 per depositary share), reflecting a partial rate since issuance in April 1993. Any cumulative dividends in arrears must be paid prior to payment of any dividends on the common stock. On December 31, 1993 there were 43 holders of records of the $6 Convertible Preferred Stock and 4.1 million depositary shares outstanding. The $6 Convertible Preferred Stock may be called beginning on March 31, 1996 at a price of $104.10 per share ($26.05 per depositary share).
ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
The following table presents selected financial and operating information for each of the five years ended December 31, 1993. Share and per share amounts refer to common shares. The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements presented elsewhere herein.
The following table sets forth unaudited summary financial results on a quarterly basis for the two most recent years.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations
Comparison of 1993 results to 1992. Total revenues rose 91% in 1993 to $229.9 million. Net income before taxes and extraordinary items more than doubled to reach $34.9 million in 1993. The increase was led by a rapid rise in production and assisted by an increase in gas processing and transportation margins. Before the effect of a favorable $3.8 million income tax accounting change in 1992 and a $1.9 million 1993 extraordinary charge on early retirement of debt, earnings per common share were $.80 in 1993 compared to $.53 in 1992, a 51% increase.
The gross margin from production operations for 1993 increased 62% to $79.7 million, which was primarily related to a 65% growth in oil and gas production. The price received per equivalent barrel decreased by 3% to $13.41. Total operating expenses including production taxes increased 60% during 1993 although operating cost per equivalent barrel ("BOE") decreased to $4.83 from $4.99 in 1992. Expense reductions gained from wells added in the DJ Basin, where operating costs averaged $2.76 per BOE, were partially offset by the late 1992 acquisition of Wyoming wells from ARCO where 1993 operating costs averaged $7.45 per BOE.
For the year ended December 31, 1993, average daily production per BOE was 25,472 Bbls, a 65% increase from 1992. Average daily production in the fourth quarter of 1993 climbed to 10,314 barrels and 105.6 MMcf (27,917 barrels of oil equivalent). The production increases resulted primarily from acquisitions and continuing development drilling in the DJ Basin of Colorado. Domestically, $51.0 million in properties were acquired in 1993, primarily in and around existing hubs in Colorado and Wyoming. The acquisitions included a significant number of development locations and should continue to add to production into 1994. In 1993, 311 wells were placed on production in the DJ Basin, with 51 wells in various stages of drilling and completion at yearend. Because the majority of the wells were added in the latter part of the year, production will not be fully impacted until 1994. Additionally, significant downtime was experienced in the fourth quarter at the major processing plant in the area and much of the gas had to be diverted, which increased line pressures and hampered production. To a lesser extent, this situation continued into early 1994.
The gross margin from gas processing, transportation and marketing activities for 1993 increased 23% to $10.0 million from $8.1 million in 1992. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million (33%) rise in transportation and processing margins as a result of additional DJ Basin production and the recent expansion of the related facilities. Gas marketing margins for 1993 decreased by $1.1 million due to reduced margins on the Oklahoma cogeneration supply contract, which declined as a result of an imposed limitation of the contract sales price and rising gas purchase costs. In 1993 the net contract margin was a loss of $267,000, which was $1.8 million less than 1992. At present gas price levels, the Company foresees continued negative or breakeven margins for the cogeneration contract through July 1994. At that time, the share of the sales price minimum attributable to gas will increase from 45% to 65% and the margin should improve. The cogeneration margin reduction was partially offset by a $667,000 (126%) rise in other gas marketing margins resulting from increased third party marketing.
Other income was $10.4 million during 1993, compared to $4.2 million in 1992. The $6.2 million increase resulted from a $3.5 million gas contract settlement received in April, a $1.7 million litigation judgment and greater gains on the sales of securities. General and administrative expenses, net of reimbursements, for 1993 represented 3% of revenues compared to 5.6% in 1992 as expenses were held essentially flat while revenues grew 91%. Interest and other expenses increased 28% primarily as a result of a rise in outstanding debt balances. Senior debt was paid down in April 1993 with proceeds from a preferred offering, but increased through yearend as a result of development expenditures, acquisitions, the investment in Command Petroleum and the retirement of the $25.0 million in subordinated debt.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization during 1993 increased 60% from the prior year. The increase was the direct result of the 65% rise in equivalent production between years. The producing depletion rate per equivalent barrel for 1993 was reduced to $4.75 from $4.79 in 1992. The rate was reduced by an ongoing drilling cost reduction program, partially offset by an increase from the discontinuation of converting Thomasville production to equivalent quantities based on relative gas prices.
The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1992. Net income for 1992 was increased by $3.8 million for the cumulative effect of the change in method of accounting for income taxes. In 1992 the income tax provision was reduced from the statutory rate of 34% by $5.5 million due to the elimination of deferred taxes as a result of tax basis in excess of financial basis. In 1993 the income tax provision was reduced from the newly enacted rate of 35% by $4.7 million upon full realization of the excess basis benefit. The Company anticipates deferred taxes will be provided in 1994 and beyond based on the full statutory rate.
Comparison of 1992 results to 1991. Revenues rose 30% in 1992 to $120.2 million, compared to $92.5 million in 1991. Net income for 1992 was $20.6 million, a 134% jump from the $8.8 million in 1991. The increases resulted from greater oil and gas production volumes, lower interest expense, reduced general and administrative expenses and a $3.8 million reversal of the cumulative effect of prior year deferred taxes with the adoption of a change in the method of accounting for income taxes.
Average daily production for 1992 rose 24% to 15,408 equivalent barrels due mostly to development drilling in the DJ Basin of Colorado as 189 wells were placed on production there. As a result, the gross margin from production increased 22% to $49.3 million in 1992. The price per equivalent barrel of oil and gas production decreased 4% during 1992.
The gross margin from gas processing, transportation and marketing activities for 1992 increased 12% to $8.1 million from $7.3 million in 1991. The growth was primarily the result of increased marketing of third party gas in New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. Gas processing and transportation margins increased moderately as volumes were increased late in the year by expansions of pipeline and plant facilities to take advantage of increasing DJ Basin production. Other income for 1992 decreased 26% to $4.2 million from a reduction in gains on sales of securities and lower interest on notes receivable.
Direct operating expenses including production taxes increased only 13% during 1992 as the operating cost per equivalent barrel decreased to $4.99 from $5.47 in 1991, due to increased DJ Basin production where operating costs have been significantly lower than average. General and administrative expenses, net of reimbursements, for 1992 represented less than 6% of revenues compared to 8% in 1991, as revenues rose 30%. Interest and other expenses dropped 39% in 1992 due to lower average outstanding senior debt after the application of proceeds from a preferred stock offering in late 1991.
Development, Acquisition and Exploration
During 1993 the Company incurred $93.1 million for oil and gas property development and exploration, $51.0 million for acquisitions and $22.6 million for gas facility expansion and other assets, for a total of $166.7 million in property and equipment expenditures. Additionally, the Company made an $18.2 million investment in an Australian based exploration and production company.
The Company has concentrated a significant portion of its development activities in the DJ Basin of Colorado. Capital expenditures for DJ Basin development totalled $75.4 million during 1993. A total of 311 newly drilled wells were placed on production there in 1993 and 51 were in progress at yearend. Additionally, 42 recompletions were performed in 1993, with seven in process at yearend. In December 1993, 16 drilling rigs were in operation in the DJ Basin. The Company anticipates putting 500 or more wells per year on production in the DJ Basin for the next few years. With additional leasing activity and through drilling costs reductions that add infill locations as proven as they become economic, the Company has increased the inventory of available drillsites. In December, the Company entered into a letter of intent with Union Pacific Resources Corporation whereby the Company will gain the right to drill wells on UPRC's previously uncommitted acreage throughout the Wattenberg area. This transaction significantly increased the Company's undeveloped Wattenberg inventory. UPRC will retain a royalty and the right to participate as a 50% working interest owner in each well, and received grants for warrants to purchase two million shares of Company stock. Of the warrants, one million expire three years from the date of grant, and are exercisable at $25 per share, while the other one million expire in four years and are exercisable at $27 per share. One year from the date of grant (February 8, 1994), the exercise prices may be reduced to 120% of the average closing price of the Company stock for the preceding 20 consecutive trading days, but not to lower than an exercise price of $21.60 per share. At that time the expiration date of the warrants may also be extended one year if the average closing price over the 20 day trading period is less than $16.50 per share.
The Company expended $14.8 million for other development and recompletion projects and $2.9 million for exploration during 1993. In Nebraska, 29 wells were added to production in 1993 as an extension of a drilling program initiated in 1992. An additional 20 wells are planned in Nebraska for 1994. In southern Wyoming, 11 wells in the East Washakie Basin development program were successfully drilled and completed during the last half of 1993 with three in process at yearend. In this program, significant cost- cutting measures were applied based on the experience gained in the DJ Basin. In central Wyoming on the properties acquired from ARCO in late 1992, efforts have been focused on increasing operating efficiency with limited development drilling and workover activity. In 1993, three successful wells were drilled in the fourth quarter and selected development and recompletion activity is scheduled for 1994. In the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, a three well test program was started in December of 1993 on acreage acquired there during the year, with one well undergoing completion, the second in progress and a third scheduled for early 1994. Current plans include a minimum of 25 wells in the basin during 1994. In South Texas, a combined operated and non-operated program was initiated, with nine wells completed in 1993 and one well abandoned. A total of 25 additional horizontal locations have been identified and drilling should continue with as many as 15 wells planned in 1994. In its domestic exploration efforts, the Company initiated a seismic program in Louisiana and began drilling early in the fourth quarter. Advanced seismic techniques are being used to identify further prospects in Louisiana and expectations are to drill up to 20 wells in 1994.
A total of $51.0 million in domestic acquisitions were completed in 1993. In May 1993, the Company purchased an interest in 121 producing wells and over 70 drilling locations in the DJ Basin area for $3.3 million. In July, an incremental 25% interest in the Company's Barrel Springs and Duck Lake Fields in Wyoming was purchased for $6.1 million. The properties are 90% gas and include 44 producing wells and 46 undeveloped locations. In August, the Company acquired interests in 225 producing wells and 272 proved undeveloped locations in the DJ Basin for $19.7 million. The proved reserves are 70% gas with more than two-thirds requiring future development to produce. Late in the year, two acquisitions were completed in the Piceance and Uinta Basins of Western Colorado for a total of $12.5 million. The majority of the value was in undeveloped locations as only 128 wells were currently producing. Numerous other producing and undeveloped acquisitions totalling $9.4 million were completed, mostly in or close to the Company's principal operating areas.
The Company's gas gathering and processing facilities have been undergoing significant transformation since late 1992. In 1993, the Company expended $20.1 million to further develop its gas related assets. The Company spent $9.4 million toward the second phase of its DJ Basin gathering expansion to construct a high pressure line to deliver gas directly to the major gas processing plant in the area and expand its gathering network for the increased drilling activity. An additional $2.6 million was expended to expand the Roggen Plant for the production increases. A total of $5.6 million in additional transportation and gathering facilities were constructed in the DJ Basin including a nine mile 16" interconnect line completed in October to relieve high line pressures, a 20" western gathering extension and numerous other extensions and connections. A gathering system that delivers third party gas to the Roggen Plant was purchased for $703,000. The Company expended $1.4 million to complete construction of a system to gather gas from its Nebraska drilling project. These projects are intended to take advantage of the significant increase in drilling activity in these areas.
In the international arena, progress continues as well. In May 1993, the Company acquired 42.8% of the outstanding shares of Command Petroleum Holdings N.L., an Australian exploration and production company, for $18.2 million. The Sydney based company is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and at December 31, 1993 had 950,000 barrels of proven oil reserves and $19.9 million of working capital. In addition, it holds interests in more than 20 exploration permits and licenses and a 28.7% interest in a Netherlands exploration and production company whose assets are located primarily in the North Sea. In Russia, the Permtex joint venture received central government approval in August and the Company executed a finance and insurance protocol with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation ("OPIC"), a United States government agency. Current plans call for 25 of the existing 45 shut-in wells to be placed on production in 1994, and that 400 development wells will be drilled over the next ten years. Extensive seismic work began in the fourth quarter of 1993 for 400 kilometers of data in Tunisia and 500 kilometers in Mongolia.
Financial Condition and Capital Resources
At December 31, 1993, the Company had total assets of $480 million and working capital of $1.3 million. Total capitalization was $412 million, of which 28% was represented by senior debt and the remainder by stockholders' equity. During 1993, the Company fully retired its $25 million of 13.5% subordinated notes and the related cumulative participating interests. During 1993, cash provided by operations was $68.3 million, an increase of 43% over 1992. As of December 31, 1993, commitments for capital expenditures totalled $7.5 million, primarily for DJ Basin drilling. The level of future expenditures is largely discretionary, and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly, depending on available opportunities and market conditions. The Company plans to finance its ongoing development, acquisition and exploration expenditures using internally generated cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and existing credit facilities. In addition, joint ventures or future public and private offerings of securities may be utilized.
In 1992, an institutional investor agreed to contribute $7 million to a partnership formed to monetize Section 29 tax credits to be realized from the Company's properties, mainly in the DJ Basin. The initial $3 million was contributed in October 1992, and at first payout in June 1993 the second contribution of $1.5 million was received. An additional $1.5 million was received in October 1993. This transaction should increase the Company's cash flow and net income through 1994. A revenue increase of more than $.40 per Mcf is realized on production generated from qualified Section 29 properties in this partnership. The Company recognized $3.8 million of this revenue during 1993. Discussions are in progress to expand this transaction so that the benefits would be extended through at least 1996.
In April 1993, the Company sold 4.1 million depositary shares (each representing a one quarter interest in one share of $100 liquidation value stock) of convertible preferred stock through an underwriting for $103.5 million. A portion of the net proceeds of $99.3 million was used to retire the entire outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at that time. The preferred stock pays a 6% dividend and is convertible into common stock at $21.00 per share. At the Company's option, the preferred stock is exchangeable into 6% convertible debentures on any dividend payment date on or after March 31, 1994. The stock is redeemable at the option of the Company on or after March 31, 1996.
Effective July 1, 1993, the Company renegotiated its bank credit facility and increased it from $150 million to $300 million. The new facility is divided into a $50 million short-term portion and a $250 million long-term portion that expires on December 31, 1997. However, management's policy is to renew the facility annually. Credit availability is adjusted semiannually to reflect changes in reserves and asset values. At December 31, 1993, the elected borrowing base was $150 million. The majority of the borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% with the remainder at prime. The Company also has the option to select CD plus 1.375%. Financial covenants limit debt, require maintenance of minimum working capital and restrict certain payments, including stock repurchases, dividends and contributions or advances to unrestricted subsidiaries. Based on such limitations, $86.5 million would have been available for the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as of December 31, 1993. The Company does not currently plan to make, and is not committed to make, any advances or contributions to unrestricted subsidiaries that would materially affect its ability to pay dividends under this limitation.
During 1993, the Company fully retired its $25.0 million of 13.5% subordinated notes and the related cumulative participating interests. An extraordinary charge to earnings of $1.9 million (net of income taxes) was made in 1993, representing the amount paid in excess of principal and accrued interest through the retirement dates. These notes were retired early in order to reduce the Company's ongoing cost of debt.
The Company maintains a program to divest marginal properties and assets which do not fit its long range plans. For 1992 and 1993, proceeds from these sales were $3.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Included in the 1993 proceeds were $4.0 million of cash receipts previously accrued for late 1992 sales. The Company intends to continue to evaluate and dispose of nonstrategic assets.
In 1990, the Company was granted a judgment in litigation regarding a leasehold assignment from the early 1980's. The Oklahoma Supreme Court refused certiorari and the judgment was upheld. As a result, a total of $1.7 million was accrued and reported in other income in 1993. The full amount was collected in January 1994. In April 1992, a jury found for the plaintiffs in a gas contract dispute related to an offshore property. In April 1993, the dispute was settled by an agreement to pay the Company a net of $5.3 million. The initial $3.5 million was received and reflected as other income in second quarter 1993. The remaining $1.8 million was received in third quarter 1993, but reflected as a reserve for possible contingencies. In April 1993, the Company was granted a $2.7 million judgment in litigation involving the allocation of proceeds from a pipeline dispute. The judgment has been appealed. The financial statements reflect these judgments only upon receipt of cash or final judicial determination.
The Company believes that its capital resources are more than adequate to meet the requirements of its business. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and gas prices, and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken.
Inflation and Changes in Prices
While certain of its costs are affected by the general level of inflation, factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations. Over the past five years, significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and gas prices. While such fluctuations have had, and will continue to have a material effect, the Company is unable to predict them.
The following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and highlights the price fluctuations by quarter for 1992 and 1993. Average gas prices exclude the Thomasville gas production. During 1993, the Company renegotiated its Thomasville gas contract and beginning in January 1994, the Company will receive a somewhat higher than market price for its Thomasville gas sales, significantly below its 1993 average price of $12.16 per Mcf. Average price computations exclude contract settlements and other nonrecurring items to provide comparability. Average prices per equivalent barrel indicate the composite impact of changes in oil and gas prices. Natural gas production is converted to oil equivalents at the rate of 6 Mcf per barrel. Equivalent prices prior to 1993 have been restated to reflect elimination of the conversion of Thomasville gas volumes based on its price relative to the Company's other gas production.
In December 1993, the Company was receiving an average of $12.54 per barrel and $2.27 per Mcf (excluding the Thomasville contract) for its production. Beginning in December 1992, the average oil price was effectively reduced by the oil production added from the Wyoming acquisition, which sells at a significant discount to West Texas Intermediate posting due to the presence of low gravity sour crude in two of the fields.

LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
SNYDER OIL CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Snyder Oil Corporation (the "Company") is engaged in the acquisition, production, development and to a lesser degree exploration of primarily domestic oil and gas properties. The Company is also involved in gas processing, transportation, gathering and marketing. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to a company formed in 1978. The Company is engaged to a modest but growing extent in international acquisition, development and exploration and maintains a number of special purpose subsidiaries which are engaged in ancillary activities including gas transmission, water disposal and management of oil and gas assets on behalf of institutional investors.
(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snyder Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). The Company accounts for its interest in joint ventures and partnerships using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are consolidated with other operations.
The Company follows the "full cost" accounting method. All costs of exploration and development are capitalized as incurred. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("depletion") is provided on the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Gas is converted to equivalent barrels at the rate of six Mcf per barrel. The depletion rates per equivalent barrel produced were $4.68, $4.79 and $4.75, respectively, in 1991, 1992 and 1993. In 1993, the practice of converting Thomasville production to equivalent quantities based on its price relative to other gas production was discontinued. No gains or losses are recognized upon the disposition of oil and gas properties except in extraordinary transactions. Proceeds are credited to the carrying value of the properties. Maintenance and repairs are expensed. Expenditures which enhance the value of the properties are capitalized. Depreciation on gas processing and transportation facilities is generally provided on a straight-line basis over 15 years.
The Company's investment in its Australian affiliate is accounted for using the equity method, whereby the cash basis investment is increased for equity in earnings and decreased for dividends received. The affiliate's functional currency is the Australian dollar. The reported foreign currency translation adjustment is the result of the translation of the Australian balance sheet into United States dollars at year-end and the related impact of exchange rates subsequent to purchase.
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Differences between primary and fully diluted earnings per share were insignificant for all periods presented. General and administrative expenses are reduced by reimbursements for well operations, drilling and management of partnerships. Reimbursements amounted to $11.1 million, $14.3 million and $17.8 million, respectively, in 1991, 1992 and 1993.
Certain amounts in the 1991 and 1992 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1993 presentation.
(3) INDEBTEDNESS
The following indebtedness was outstanding on the respective dates:
The Company maintains a $300 million revolving credit facility. The facility is divided into a $250 million long-term portion and a $50 million short-term portion. However, management's policy is to renew the facility annually. The elected borrowing base available under the facility at December 31, 1993 was $150 million. The majority of the borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% with the remainder at prime. During 1993, the average borrowing cost was 4.9%. The Company pays certain fees based on the borrowing base and outstanding loans. Covenants require maintenance of minimum working capital, limit the incurrence of debt and restrict dividends, stock repurchases, certain investments, other indebtedness and unrelated business activities. At December 31, 1992, the Company recorded the $49.8 million Wyoming acquisition commitment as other senior debt. The cash flow statement did not reflect the commitment as an increase in indebtedness until final payment was disbursed in February 1993.
The subordinated notes bore interest at 13.5% and were due in four annual payments commencing November 15, 1993. The notes were subject to optional redemption at 102% of principal after November 1994 and at par after November 1995. Cumulative rights to receive additional interest based on net cash flow above certain minimum levels were issued in connection with the notes. Cash flow has substantially exceeded the minimum since 1991, and the Company has since made the maximum payments. At December 31, 1992, based on existing market rates the subordinated notes and cumulative interest rights had a combined fair value of $27.7 million, which the Company believes approximated its cost of funds for notes with similar terms. In March 1993, the Company retired 40% of the cumulative rights. The portion of the payment representing prepaid interest was expensed as an extraordinary item, net of income taxes, for $384,000. In August 1993, the Company retired $10 million (40%) of the subordinated notes. The portion of the payment representing prepaid interest was expensed as an extraordinary item, net of income taxes, for $462,000. In November 1993, the Company retired the remaining $15 million of the subordinated notes and the related 60% of cumulative rights, with the portion of the payment representing prepaid interest expensed as an extraordinary item, net of income taxes, for $1.1 million. The Company expensed $1.1 million, $1.1 million and $516,000 as interest expense for cumulative rights in 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively.
Scheduled maturities of indebtedness are $15,000 for 1994, $17,000 for 1995 and 1996, and $114.9 million in 1997. The long-term portion of the revolving credit facility is scheduled to expire in 1997; however, management's policy is to renew the facility annually.
Cash payments for interest expense were $7.9 million, $5.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively, for 1991, 1992 and 1993.
(4) INVESTMENTS
The Company has investments in foreign and domestic energy companies and notes receivable, which at December 31, 1992 and 1993, had a total book value of $7.4 million and $29.4 million, respectively, with corresponding fair market values of $9.8 million and $54.2 million.
In May 1993, the Company acquired 92 million (42.8%) of the outstanding shares of Command Petroleum Holdings N.L. ("Command"), an Australian exploration and production company, for $18.2 million. The Sydney based company is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and holds interests in more than 20 exploration permits and licenses as well as a 28.7% interest in a publicly traded Netherlands exploration and production company whose assets are located primarily in the North Sea. The market value of the Company's investment in Command based on Command's closing price at December 31, 1993 was $39.1 million. The investment is accounted for by the equity method. Command has outstanding stock options covering the issuance of up to 53.3 million common shares that expire November 30, 1994. Given that the exercise price of the options is 44% below the year-end stock price, the Company assumes they will be exercised. In January 1994, Command completed an offering of 43 million of its common shares. As a result of this offering, the Company's ownership was reduced to 35.7%. If, as expected, all of the November 1994 options were exercised, the Company's ownership would be reduced to 29.6%.
The Company has investments in securities of publicly traded domestic energy companies, not accounted for by the equity method, having a book value and total cost at December 31, 1992 and 1993 of $680,000 and $9.7 million, respectively. The market value of these securities at December 31, 1992 and 1993 approximated $2.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 1994, the Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Under the provisions of SFAS No. 115, at December 31, 1993 the Company would have increased its investments by $3.6 million and increased stockholders' equity by $2.3 million and deferred tax liability by $1.3 million.
The Company holds $1.8 million in notes receivable due from privately held corporations. All notes are secured by certain assets, including stock and oil and gas properties. At December 31, 1992 and 1993, the fair value of the notes receivable, based on existing market conditions and the anticipated future net cash flow related to the notes, was believed to be equal to their book value.
(5) OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
The cost of oil and gas properties at December 31, 1992 and 1993 includes $4.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, of unevaluated leasehold. Such properties are held for exploration, development or resale and are excluded from amortization. The following table sets forth costs incurred related to oil and gas properties and gas processing and transportation facilities:
In December 1992, the Company acquired certain producing properties located in north central Wyoming from a major oil company for $56.1 million. An initial cash payment of $6.3 million was made in December 1992. The remaining $49.8 million was recorded as senior debt on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1992, but not reflected on the Company's cash flow statement as an acquisition until payment was made in February 1993. Costs incurred above also differ from the cash flow statement as a result of certain cost recoveries and accrual items. The remaining 1992 acquisitions were primarily for producing properties in Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas. In May 1993, the Company purchased an interest in 121 producing wells and over 70 drilling locations in the DJ Basin of Colorado for $3.3 million. In July 1993, an incremental 25% interest in the Company's Barrel Springs and Duck Lake Fields was purchased for $6.1 million. In August 1993, the Company acquired interests in 225 producing wells and 272 undeveloped locations in the DJ Basin for $19.7 million. In late 1993, two acquisitions were completed in the Piceance and Uinta Basins of Western Colorado for a total of $12.5 million. A number of other producing and undeveloped acquisitions totalling $9.4 million were completed during 1993 as well, mostly in or close to the Company's principal operating areas. In late 1992, the Company initiated projects to further develop its gas gathering and processing facilities. A $4.5 million DJ Basin low pressure gathering system expansion was completed to provide new sources of inlet gas to the Roggen plant. Simultaneously, a $2.0 million expansion at Roggen raised plant capacity by 60% to 55 MMcf per day. An additional $848,000 was expended in 1992 to acquire a Roggen net profits interest and a pipeline in the area. In 1993, the Company expended $9.4 million toward the second phase of its DJ Basin gathering expansion to construct a high pressure line to deliver gas directly to the major gas processing plant in the area and expand its gathering network for the increased drilling activity. A total of $5.6 million in additional transportation and gathering facilities were constructed in 1993 in the DJ Basin including a nine mile 16" diameter interconnect line completed in October to relieve high line pressures, a 20" diameter western gathering extension and numerous other extensions and connections. In 1993, the Roggen plant was further enhanced with $2.6 million of capital expenditures. The Company expended $1.4 million to complete construction of a system to gather gas from its Nebraska drilling project. A number of lesser facilities were purchased in 1993 to expand the Company's gathering and processing capabilities in its active hub areas.
Acquisitions are accounted for utilizing the purchase method. The following unaudited pro forma information shows the effect on the consolidated statements of operations assuming that the 1992 significant acquisitions were consummated as of January 1, 1992. Individual 1993 acquisitions did not meet the significance test, therefore no 1993 pro forma information is presented. Future results may differ substantially from pro forma results due to changes in oil and gas prices, production declines and other factors. Therefore, pro forma statements cannot be considered indicative of future operations.
(6) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
A total of 75 million common shares, $.01 par value, are authorized of which 23.3 million were issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993. In 1992, the Company issued 234,000 shares and repurchased 215,000 shares. In 1993, the Company issued 386,000 shares, with 309,000 shares issued primarily for the exercise of stock options by employees and 77,000 shares issued on conversion of 14,000 preferred shares. The Company made five quarterly dividend payments of $.05 per share in 1992 due to an acceleration in the quarterly payment date. In 1993, the Company paid first and second quarter dividends of $.05 per share and increased dividends to $.06 per share in the third and fourth quarters.
A total of 10 million preferred shares, $.01 par value, are authorized. In December 1991, 1.2 million shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock were sold through an underwriting. The net proceeds were $57.4 million. The preferred stock carries an 8% dividend and is convertible into common stock at $9.07 per share. The stock is exchangeable at the option of the Company for 8% convertible subordinated debentures on any dividend payment date. The stock is redeemable at the option of the Company on or after December 31, 1994. The liquidation preference is $50.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. During 1995, the stock is redeemable at $52.50 per share if the closing price exceeds 150% of the prevailing conversion price (currently $13.61 per share) for 20 of the preceding 30 trading days. After 1995, no minimum stock price is required. The redemption price declines $.50 per year to $50.00 per share in 2000. In 1993, 14,000 preferred shares were converted into 77,000 common shares.
In April 1993, 4.1 million depositary shares (each representing a one quarter interest in one share of $100 liquidation value stock) of convertible preferred stock were sold through an underwriting. The net proceeds were $99.3 million. The preferred stock carries a 6% dividend and is convertible into common stock at $21.00 per share. The stock is exchangeable at the option of the Company for 6% convertible subordinated debentures on any dividend payment date on or after March 31, 1994. The stock is redeemable at the option of the Company on or after March 31, 1996. The liquidation preference is $25.00 per depositary share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company paid $4.8 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in preferred dividends during 1992 and 1993.
The Company maintains a stock option plan for Company employees providing for the issuance of options at prices not less than fair market value. Options to acquire up to 3 million shares of common stock may be outstanding at any given time. The specific terms of grant and exercise are determinable by a committee of independent members of the Board of Directors. The majority of currently outstanding options vest over a three-year period (30%, 60%, 100%) and expire five to seven years from date of grant.
In 1990, the shareholders adopted a stock grant and option plan (the "Directors' Plan") for non-employee Directors of the Company. The Directors' Plan provides for each non-employee director to receive 500 common shares quarterly in payment of their annual retainer. It also provides for 2,500 options to be granted annually to each non-employee Director. The options vest over a three-year period (30%, 60%, 100%) and expire five years from date of grant.
At December 31, 1993, 1.4 million options were outstanding under both plans at exercise prices of $4.53 to $19.25 per share. At December 31, 1993, a total of 600,000 of such options were vested having exercise prices of $4.53 to $13.00 per share. During 1992, 223,000 options were exercised at prices of $3.02 to $6.00 per share, and 52,000 were forfeited. During 1993, 309,000 options were exercised at prices of $4.53 to $9.13 per share, and 23,000 were forfeited.
(7) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1992. Net income for 1992 was increased by $3.8 million for the cumulative effect of the change in method of accounting for income taxes as a result of tax basis in excess of financial basis. At December 31, 1993, the Company had no liability for foreign taxes. A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory rate to the Company's effective income tax rate follows:
For book purposes the components of the Company's net deferred asset and liability at December 31, 1992 and 1993, respectively, were:
For tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $69.1 million at December 31, 1993. These carryforwards expire between 1997 and 2008. At December 31, 1993, the Company had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.4 million and depletion carryforwards of $1.1 million, both of which are available indefinitely. Current income taxes shown in the financial statements reflect estimates of alternative minimum taxes due. Cash payments during 1992 and 1993 were $1.0 million and $75,000, respectively.
(8) SALES TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS
In 1991, 1992 and 1993, Amoco Production Company accounted for 17%, 27% and 12%, respectively, of revenues. Management believes that the loss of any individual purchaser would not have a material adverse impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
(9) DEFERRED CREDITS
In 1992, an institutional investor agreed to contribute $7 million to a partnership formed to monetize Section 29 tax credits to be realized from the Company's properties, mainly in the DJ Basin. The initial $3 million was contributed in October 1992, and at first payout in June 1993 the second contribution of $1.5 million was received. An additional $1.5 million was received in October 1993. A revenue increase of more than $.40 per Mcf is realized on production generated from qualified Section 29 properties in this partnership. The Company recognized $780,000 of this revenue during 1992 and $3.8 million during 1993.
(10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company rents office space and gas compressors at various locations under non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum future payments under such leases approximate $2.1 million for 1994, $2.2 million for 1995, $2.3 million for 1996 and 1997, and $2.1 million for 1998.
In 1990, the Company was granted a judgment in litigation regarding a disputed leasehold assignment from the early 1980's. The Oklahoma Supreme Court refused certiorari and the judgment was upheld. As a result, a total of $1.7 million was accrued and reported in other income in 1993. The full amount was collected in January 1994. In April 1992, the Company was granted a judgment in a gas contract dispute related to an offshore property. The dispute was settled in April 1993 by an agreement to pay the Company a net of $5.3 million. The Company received theses monies in 1993 and reflected $3.5 million as other income with the remaining $1.8 million recorded as a liability for possible contingencies. In April 1993, the Company was granted a $2.7 million judgment in litigation involving the allocation of proceeds from a pipeline dispute. The judgment has been appealed. The Company is a party to various other lawsuits incidental to its business, none of which are anticipated to have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations. The financial statements reflect favorable legal judgments only upon receipt of cash or final judicial determination.
(11) UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION:
Independent petroleum consultants directly evaluated 51%, 74%, and 62% of proved reserves at December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively, and performed a detailed review of properties which comprised in excess of 80% of proved reserve value. All reserve estimates are based on economic and operating conditions at that time. Future net cash flows as of each year-end were computed by applying then current prices to estimated future production less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in producing and developing the reserves. All reserves are located onshore in the United States and in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
