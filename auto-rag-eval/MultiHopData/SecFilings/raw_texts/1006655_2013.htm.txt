Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues
The SEC sets rules related to reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. These rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Subject to limited exceptions, the rules also require that proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and estimates of reserves quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available.
Estimated future net revenues discounted at 10% or PV-10 is a financial measure that is not recognized by GAAP. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies, and that it is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. Further, analysts and investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. We also use this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our Company. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure as defined under GAAP, and reconciled herein.
Summary of Oil & Gas Reserves for Fiscal Year Ended 2013
Our proved and probable reserves at June 30, 2013, denominated in equivalent barrels using six Mcf of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, were estimated by our independent petroleum engineers, W.D. Von Gonten & Co. ("Von Gonten"), Pinnacle Energy Services L.L.C. ("Pinnacle") and DeGolyer and MacNaughton ("D&M"). Von Gonten was engaged for our Texas properties due to their particular expertise in the geographic and geologic areas covered by their reports. D&M was selected for our interests in the Delhi Field due to their expertise in CO2-EOR
projects and to ensure consistency with the Operator who has utilized D&M for their reserves estimates in the Delhi Field. Our probable reserves in Oklahoma were estimated by Pinnacle Energy Services L.L.C. due to their particular expertise in Oklahoma and the Mississippian Lime reservoir. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in letters from each of those firms, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth our estimated proved and probable reserves as of June 30, 2013. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional unaudited reserve information is provided. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $91.51 per barrel of crude oil and $3.44 per MMbtu of natural gas. The price of natural gas liquids utilized was based on the historical price received versus the NYMEX basis oil price or, if no historical received price is available, historical price in the area. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.

Summary of Oil & Gas Reserves for Fiscal Year Ended 2011
Our proved and probable reserves at June 30, 2011, denominated in equivalent barrels using six Mcf of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, were estimated by our independent petroleum engineers, Von Gonten, D&M and Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. ("Keeling"). Keeling was engaged for our Eastern Oklahoma properties due to their particular expertise in the geographic and geologic areas covered by their report. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in letters from each of those firms, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2011. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional unaudited reserve information is provided. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $90.09 per barrel of crude oil and $4.21 per MMbtu of natural gas. The price of natural gas liquids utilized was based on the historical price received versus the NYMEX basis oil price. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.
June 30, 2011
Changes in Oil and Gas Reserves
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, total proved reserves increased 325 MBOE from 13,441 MBOE at June 30, 2012 to 13,766 MBOE at June 30, 2013. The increase is primarily attributable to 2,806 MBOE of upward revisions at Delhi, partially offset by 227 MBOE of production and divestitures of 2,254 MBOE of our Giddings Field properties. The upward revision of 2,806 MBOE in proved reserves in the Delhi Field is due primarily to revision of geological maps based on production results and acquired seismic data, inclusion of one reservoir with similar features, production history and suitability for EOR, and inclusion of natural gas processing at Delhi. Proved developed reserves increased to 73% of proved reserves, a 13% improvement from 60% of proved reserves that were developed at June 30, 2012. See table below for details.
The upgrade of Probable Reserves to Proved Reserves at Delhi contributed to a decline of 1,454 MBOE during the year. In addition, we sold a portion of our Mississippian Lime joint venture interest back to the operator and accordingly experienced a downward revision in reserves per Mississippian Lime drilling location. The overall decline was partially offset by the upward revision of probable reserves at Delhi due to the addition of natural gas processing. Approximately 32% of our probable reserves are developed compared to 21% as at June 30, 2012.
We added a possible reserves category this year to incorporate the probability of additional recovery of approximately 3,688 MBOE at Delhi associated with unrecovered secondary oil. These reserves are an estimate of the potential recovery of oil not previously recovered during the pressure maintenance phase of operations due to the inadequate sweep efficiency utilized in the pressure maintenance operation prior to the current patterned injection of CO2 and water. Approximately 72% of our possible reserves are developed as they are associated with current and future wells and existing plant.
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, total proved reserves declined 406 MBOE from 13,847 MBOE at June 30, 2011 to 13,441 MBOE at June 30, 2012. The decrease is primarily attributable to 208 MBOE of production, downward revisions for our Woodford properties in Oklahoma and lease terminations in Giddings Fields, partially offset by an upward revision at Delhi and extensions in South Texas and acquired well bores in the Giddings Fields. The upward revision of 210 MBO in proved oil reserves in the Delhi Field is due primarily to a slight acceleration in the projected reversion date of our approximately 24% working interest based on performance to date. The downward revision of 367 MBOE in Giddings is primarily due to our election to allow certain leases containing proved reserves to expire due to unacceptable economics based on low natural gas prices. The additions and revisions in our properties were offset by production of 208 MBOE. See table below for details.
Major changes in reserve categories and significant additions to probable reserves also occurred during fiscal 2012. Proved developed reserves increased to 60% of proved reserves, a 54% improvement from 39% of proved reserves that were developed at June 30, 2011. The 2,688 MBO increase in proved developed reserves was largely due to development activities at Delhi, wherein the operator expended $96 million of their capital for the benefit our combined accounts. We also experienced two major changes in our probable reserves during fiscal 2012. First, probable reserves increased104% increase over the 6,216 MBOE level at the end of fiscal 2011, to 12,678 MBOE. Virtually all of the 6,462 MBOE increase in probable reserves was due to the undeveloped acreage positions we acquired in the Mississippian Lime play we acquired in Kay County, OK during fiscal 2012. Secondly, probable
developed reserves at Delhi increased 39% to 2,653 MBO from 1,902 MBO at yearend fiscal 2011, due to capital expenditures mentioned above. See tables immediately above.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons with Oversight for the Company's Overall Reserve Estimation Process
Our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Operations and to be in compliance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. We provide each engineering firm with property interests, production, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Vice President of Operations and our Chief Executive Officer to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to our third party engineering firm. The scope and results of our third party engineering firms' procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A letter which identifies the professional qualifications of each of the independent engineering firms who prepared the reserve reports are also filed as exhibits to this Annual report on Form 10-K.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2013 were 3,676 MBOE. Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2013 totaled approximately $50.4 million. The 1,732 MBOE decrease in proved undeveloped reserves from 5,408 MBOE as of June 30, 2012 is attributable to the sale of 1,840 MBOE of our Giddings Field properties partially offset by positive revisions of 108 MBOE.
None of our proved undeveloped locations at June 30, 2013 have remained undeveloped for five years from the date of initial recognition as proved undeveloped reserves.
Sales Volumes, Average Sales Prices and Average Production Costs
The following table shows the Company's sales volumes and average sales prices received for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas for the periods indicated:
Average production costs, excluding ad valorem and production taxes, per unit of production (using a six to one conversion ratio of Mcf's to barrels) were approximately $8, $8 and $11 per BOE for the years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas sales volumes, net to our interest, for the year ended June 30, 2013 increased 9% to 226,819 BOE, compared to 208,156 BOE for the year ended June 30, 2012. Our sales volumes for the year ended June 30, 2013 included 180,658 Bbls of oil from Delhi compared to 136,074 Bbls of oil during the previous fiscal year, and 46,161 BOE in aggregate from our Giddings and Lopez Fields in Texas and our Oklahoma properties, compared to 72,082 BOE during the previous fiscal year. Production from our Giddings properties were impacted by the divestments of our nonGARP® producing wells during the year.
Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas sales volumes, net to our interest, for the year ended June 30, 2012 increased 79% to 208,156 BOE, compared to 116,437 BOE for the year ended June 30, 2011. Our sales volumes for the year ended June 30, 2012 included 136,074 Bbls of oil from Delhi compared to 44,141 Bbls of oil during the previous fiscal year, and 72,082 BOE in aggregate from our Giddings and
Lopez Fields in Texas and our Oklahoma properties, compared to 72,296 BOE during the previous fiscal year.
Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas sales volumes, net to our interest, for the year ended June 30, 2011 decreased 7% to 116,437 BOE, compared to 125,515 BOE for the year ended June 30, 2010. Our sales volumes for the year ended June 30, 2011 included 44,141 Bbls of oil from Delhi compared to 6,333 Bbls of oil during the previous fiscal year and 71,010 BOE from our properties in the Giddings Field in Texas compared to 119,182 BOE during the previous fiscal year.
First EOR oil production at Delhi began in mid-March 2010. Our interests in the Delhi Field comprise approximately 98% of our total proved reserves as of June 30, 2013. The average sales price per barrel of crude oil at Delhi was $106.38 for the year ended June 30, 2013, with no associated production costs.
Production from our properties in the Giddings Field decreased 43% from 69,260 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 2012 to 39,643 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 due to the divestment of our nonGARP® producing wells and normal production decline. Our remaining interests in the Giddings Field consist of a nonmaterial portion of our total proved reserves as of June 30, 2013. The average sales price per BOE at Giddings was $45.46 for the year ended June 30, 2013. The associated production cost in Giddings for the year ended June 30, 2013 (not including ad valorem and production taxes) was $28.51 per BOE.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth our drilling activity. During 2013, we completed 2 gross and 0.8 net wells in Kay County, Oklahoma. We also plugged and abandoned 1 gross and 0.2 net well in the Giddings Field. During 2012, we drilled and completed one gross and net well in the Lopez Field, declared dry two wells in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, and plugged and abandoned one well in our Giddings Field. One well drilled in the Lopez Field was temporarily inactive pending permitting. In 2011, we drilled and completed 3 gross and 0.6 net wells in the Giddings Field and plugged and abandoned one Wagoner County, Oklahoma well, drilled in the previous year as a dry hole.
Present Activities
As of June 30, 2013 there were 2 gross and 0.8 net wells in Kay County, Oklahoma that were completed during the year and one gross and 0.45 net salt water disposal well that was drilled in the previous year and completed in the current year.
Certain wells drilled and completed waiting on pipeline in Wagoner County, Oklahoma remain shut-in and we do not expect to establish pipeline connections prior to sale or lease expiration. One
well acquired and re-entered in 2011 and completed in 2012 in Haskell County, Oklahoma was established as a producing well with 5.8 MMCF of sales during 2012. In 2012, that well was shut-in and resumption of production is not expected.
Two gross and net wells were drilled and completed, but waiting on permit, as of June 30, 2012 in the Lopez Field in Texas. One of the wells is a salt water injection well and one is a producer well. Both wells are shut-in as of June 30, 2013.
The operator of the Delhi Field continued development through drilling and well re-entering activities in the western half of the field during 2013. CO2 injection was increased during the year as additional injection wells were added during the year, except for temporary cooling capacity issues early in the first quarter, scheduled plant maintenance operations during the third quarter, and a temporary suspension of injection in a portion of the field due to an environmental event late in the fourth quarter, all as discussed at "Delhi Field EOR" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As our interest in the Delhi Field is currently an overriding royalty interest, we do not show gross and net well activity in Delhi.
For further discussion, see "Highlights for our fiscal year 2013" and "Looking forward into 2013" under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
