ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, except for our interest in Peak Gold, and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage streams and royalties, as well their respective reserves, are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have royalties, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The Company manages its business under two reportable segments, consisting of the acquisition and management of stream interests and the acquisition and management of royalty interests. The description of our principal streams and royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, stream or royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our stream and royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which stream and royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues
from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such stream and royalty interests are no longer principal to our business. Currently, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically by stream and royalty interest) to be principal to our business.
Stream Interests
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
As discussed in further detail in Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2016 Business Developments, RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 100% of the gold produced from the Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered, 50% thereafter. The cash purchase price equals 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased.
Andacollo is an open-pit mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by CMCA. The Andacollo mine is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo mine by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Stream deliveries from Andacollo were 41,700 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Production attributable to our royalty interest at Andacollo during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, was 41,500 ounces of gold. Teck has indicated that they expect calendar 2016 gold grade and production to exceed calendar 2015.
Mount Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
As of June 30, 2016, RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 52.25% of the payable gold produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by Terrane, a subsidiary of Thompson Creek. The cash purchase price is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price. Please refer to Item 1, Business, Recent Business Developments, for a description of a proposed amendment to our stream interest at Mount Milligan in connection with the sale of Thompson Creek to Centerra.
The Mount Milligan project is an open-pit mine and is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mount Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were 111,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, an increase of approximately 50% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was due to higher mill throughput and gold grade.
Thompson Creek estimates that Mount Milligan gold production will be at the lower end of their calendar 2016 production guidance of 240,000 to 270,000 ounces.
Pueblo Viejo (Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic)
On September 29, 2015, RGLD Gold acquired the right to purchase 7.5% of Barrick's interest in the gold produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% thereafter. The cash purchase price of the gold is 30% of the spot price of gold delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered thereafter. RGLD Gold also owns the right to purchase 75% of Barrick's interest in the silver produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine, subject to a minimum silver recovery of 70%, until 50 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.5% thereafter. The cash purchase price of the silver is 30% of the spot price of silver delivered until 23.1 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price per ounce of silver delivered thereafter.
The Pueblo Viejo mine is located in the province of Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic, approximately 60 miles northwest of Santo Domingo, and is owned by a joint venture in which Barrick holds a 60% interest and is responsible for operations, and in which Goldcorp holds a 40% interest. Pueblo Viejo is accessed from Santo Domingo by traveling northwest on Autopista Duarte, Highway #1, approximately 48 miles to Piedra Blanca and proceeding east for approximately 14 miles on Highway #17 to the gatehouse for Pueblo Viejo. Both Highway #1 and Highway #17 are paved.
Stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were 42,200 ounces of gold and 532,600 ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. In November 2015, Barrick announced that two of three electric motors at the Pueblo Viejo oxygen plant experienced unexpected failures and that a comprehensive plan to mitigate the impact of the motor failure was implemented in December 2015, which involved installing a number of portable compressors. Barrick was able to restore capacity to 100% by mid-January 2016 with portable compressor motors. The first repaired motor was reinstalled and commissioned in late January 2016 and the second motor was repaired and reinstalled early February 2016.
In calendar 2016, Barrick expects improved throughput and plant availability as compared to calendar 2015 primarily due to overcoming the issues related to the oxygen plant motor failures which negatively impacted 2015 throughput. In addition, Barrick is focused on improving efficiency and
throughput through ore blending optimization, increasing autoclave availability, and optimization of maintenance strategies. A prefeasibility study is expected to be commissioned in the second half of calendar 2016 to evaluate a possible increase in tailings storage capacity, giving the potential to move a significant portion of the mine's 7.7 million ounces of gold and 44.7 million ounces of silver in measured and indicated resources to reserves.
Barrick delivers gold and silver to RGLD Gold on a quarterly basis (mid-March, June, September and December) based on Barrick's 60% indirect share of any provisional and final offtake settlements in the prior three calendar month period, subject to certain specific terms of the agreement (including a fixed silver recovery assumption of 70%). RGLD Gold usually sells gold and silver ounces over the three month period following physical receipt. All of these factors may result in a difference of produced ounces reported by Barrick and those reported as sold by Royal Gold for each quarter.
Wassa and Prestea (Western Region, Ghana)
As discussed in further detail in Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2016 Business Developments, on July 28, 2015, RGLD Gold acquired the right to purchase 9.25% of the gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea projects, operated by Golden Star, until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2017 or (ii) the date at which the Wassa and Prestea underground projects achieve commercial production. At that point, the stream percentage will increase to 10.5% of gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea mines until an aggregate 240,000 ounces have been delivered. Once the applicable delivery threshold is met, the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5% for the remaining term of the transaction.
The Wassa open pit mine and oxide ore mill are located near the village of Akyempim in the Wassa East District, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 50 miles north of Cape Coast and 93 miles west of the capital Accra. The main access to the site is from the east, via the Cape Coast to Twifo-Praso road, then over the combined road-rail bridge on the Pra River. There is also an access road from Takoradi in the south via Mpohor. An airport at Takoradi is capable of handling jet aircraft and is serviced by several commercial flights each day. Future Wassa production will come from both open pit and underground operations.
Prestea is currently an open pit operation producing oxide ore located in the Ashanti gold district in the central eastern section of the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 6 miles south of the town of Bogoso. Access to the property is by commercial air carrier to Accra and then by vehicle on a paved and gravel road.
Stream deliveries from Wassa and Prestea were 21,500 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Golden Star's total production in calendar 2016 is expected to be between 180,000 - 205,000 ounces of gold.
On July 12, 2016, Golden Star announced pre-commercial production commenced at Wassa underground gold mine, as scheduled. Wassa underground is expected to achieve commercial production in early calendar 2017, at which time it is expected to deliver 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of ore per day. The Prestea underground project is currently in development with a planned average annual gold production of 90,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of $468 per ounce. Golden Star expects first production from the Prestea underground project in mid-calendar 2017.
Royalty Interests
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a series of large open-pits and underground mines, utilizing mill and heap leach processing, and is operated by Barrick. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our
royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline, South Pipeline, part of the Gap pit and the Crossroads deposit, which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)Reserve Claims ("GSR1"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the "Reserve Claims," which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR royalty rate on the Reserve Claims is tied to the gold price as shown in the table below and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation.
(b)GAS Claims ("GSR2"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the "GAS Claims," which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR royalty rate on the GAS Claims, as shown in the table below, is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation.
(c)Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty ("GSR3"). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)Net Value Royalty ("NVR1"). This is a fixed 1.25% NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. The Company owns 81.098% of the 1.25% NVR (or 1.014%) while limited partners in Crescent Valley Partners, L.P., which is consolidated in our financial statements, own the remaining portion of the 1.25% NVR. A 0.618% portion of our NVR1 royalty covers the mining claims that comprise the Crossroads deposit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
The following shows the current sliding-scale GSR1 and GSR2 royalty rates under our royalty agreement with Cortez:
Production attributable to our royalty interest at Cortez decreased approximately 68% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to Barrick's production focus on Cortez Hills, where we do not have a royalty interest, and reduced production from the Pipeline, South Pipeline and Gap pits, where our royalty applies, compared to the prior fiscal year. Barrick expects calendar 2016 gold production at Cortez,
subject to our royalty interests to be down compared to calendar 2015 production. Waste stripping at Crossroads, which is subject to our royalty interest, is expected to restart later in calendar 2016.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp"). The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Gold, silver, lead and zinc production attributable to our royalty interest at Peñasquito decreased approximately 21%, 13%, 15% and 2%, respectively, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in production is attributable to lower throughput, grades and recovery. Additionally, production decreased as a result of a 10-day shutdown during the June 2016 quarter for planned mill maintenance. By July 2016, the mill returned to normal operations. Over the next three calendar years, Goldcorp expects mining activities in the pit to be focused on lower grade ore in the upper parts of the Peñasco pit while stripping is emphasized to ensure an economically optimal pit shell design to maximize the net asset value of the operation. By calendar 2019, Goldcorp expects Peñasquito's gold production to benefit from mining higher grades at the bottom of the Peñasco pit and significantly enhanced metallurgical recoveries with the planned completion of the approval of the Pyrite Leach Project ("PLP") in July 2016. The PLP is expected to increase overall gold and silver recovery by treating the zinc tailings before discharge to the tailings storage facility. Construction activities continued on the Northern Well Field ("NWF") project with 15% of the total water production commissioned by June 30, 2016. The NWF remains on schedule for completion by the end of the September 2016 quarter.
Principal Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal development stage properties. Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
We own a 0.78% to 5.45% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. The Company owns an additional royalty equivalent to 1.09% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick's operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interests are applicable to all gold and copper production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million; (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be
extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) we also increased our interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note: Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
Pascua-Lama is one of the world's largest gold and silver deposits with nearly 18 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, 676 million ounces of silver contained within the gold reserves, and an expected mine life of 25 years. Barrick expects Pascua-Lama to produce an average of 800,000 to 850,000 ounces of gold and 35 million ounces of silver annually during its first full five years of operation.
During the fourth quarter of calendar 2013, Barrick announced the temporary suspension of construction at Pascua-Lama, except for activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance. A decision to restart development will depend on improved economics and reduced uncertainty related to legal and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the timing of any such decision to restart, permitting timelines, construction schedule and timing of first production are uncertain.
Rainy River (Ontario, Canada)
As discussed in further detail in Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2016 Business Developments, RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 6.50% of the gold produced from the Rainy River project until 230,000 gold ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% thereafter; and 60% of the silver produced from the Rainy River project until 3.1 million silver ounces have been delivered, and 30% thereafter. The cash purchase price for the gold and silver ounces is 25% of the spot price per ounce of gold or silver at the time of delivery.
The Rainy River project is centered within the Richardson Township in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and is operated by New Gold. The project is approximately 40 miles northwest of Fort Frances and approximately 100 miles south of Kenora and approximately 260 miles west of Thunder Bay. The project site is easily accessible by a network of secondary all-weather roads that branch off the well-maintained Trans-Canada Highways 11 and 71.
Construction was initiated in calendar 2015. In July 2016, New Gold reported that overall construction was approximately 40%. During the June 2016 quarter, installation of the mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation equipment commenced in the grinding building and the primary crusher, and the first ball mill shell was installed. During the course of the construction of the water management facility earlier in calendar 2016, New Gold identified areas where the strength of the foundation is less than was estimated for the original designs. As a result, during the June 2016 quarter, New Gold submitted revised construction designs for regulatory review. New Gold anticipates receipt of the requisite permit amendments to begin remediation work on the water management facility within the September 2016 quarter. New Gold also is finalizing its review of the tailings management facility design, parts of which are similarly impacted by the foundation conditions, and plans to submit its proposed redesigns for regulatory review by mid-August 2016. With construction of the processing facilities and other components of the project on schedule, and the process of amending the water and tailings management facilities advancing as planned, New Gold continues to target first production at Rainy River in mid-2017.
Reserve Information
Table 1 below summarizes proven and probable reserves for gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, cobalt and molybdenum that are subject to our stream and royalty interests as of December 31, 2015, as reported to us by the operators of the mines. Properties are currently in production unless noted as development ("DEV") within the table. The exploration royalties we own do not contain proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2015. Please refer to pages 35-36 for the footnotes to Table 1.

Proven and Probable Silver Reserves
As of December 31, 2015(1)
Proven and Probable Base Metal Reserves
As of December 31, 2015(1)
(1)Reserves have been reported by the operators of record as of December 31, 2015, with the exception of the following properties: Don Mario-September 30, 2015; Gwalia Deeps, South Laverton-June 30, 2015; Hasbrouck Mountain-June 3, 2015; Wharf-June 1, 2015; Svetloye-January 1, 2015; Bald Mountain, El Morro, El Toqui, Gold Hill, Holt, Inata, La India, Meekatharra (Nannine, Paddy's Flat, Reedys and Yaloginda), Pinson, Rainy River, Ruby Hill and Soledad Mountain-December 31, 2014; Back River-October 21, 2014; Kundip-June 30, 2014; Celtic/Wonder North-November 21, 2013; Schaft Creek-December 31, 2012; Don Nicolas, Johnson Camp and Pascua-Lama-December 31, 2011; Mara Rosa-October 28, 2011; Balcooma-June 30, 2011; Kutcho Creek-February 15, 2011; Pine Cove-June 30, 2010; and Caber-July 18, 2007.
(2)Gold reserves were calculated by the operators at the following per ounce prices: A$1,500-South Laverton; A$1,474-Southern Cross $1,450-Kundip; A$1,400-Celtic/Wonder North and Meekatharra (Nannine, Paddy's Flat, Reedys and Yaloginda); $1,366-Schaft Creek; $1,350-El Toqui; A$1,310-Red Dam; $1,300-El Morro, Pinson and Svetloye; $1,275-Wharf; $1,250-Back River, Holt, Inata, La India, Mount Milligan, Mulatos and Soledad Mountain; A$1,250-Gwalia Deeps; $1,225-Hasbrouck Mountain; $1,200-Andacollo, El Limon, Gold Hill, Leeville, Pascua-Lama, Robinson, Taparko and Twin Creeks; $1,180-Dolores; $1,150-Canadian Malartic; $1,100-Bald Mountain, Don Mario, Don Nicolas, Mara Rosa, Marigold, Peñasquito, Ruby Hill, Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea and Williams; $1,000-Cortez, Goldstrike and Pueblo Viejo; and $983-Pine Cove. No gold price was reported for Balcooma, Caber or Kutcho Creek.
(3)Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Reserve" is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. "Proven (Measured) Reserves" are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established.
"Probable (Indicated) Reserves" are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
(4)Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(5)The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Royal Gold did not prepare reserve or feasibility studies and does not have the ability to independently confirm any reserve information presented. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)"Contained ounces" or "contained pounds" do not take into account recovery losses in mining and processing the ore.
(7)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $375 - 1.75%; >$375 to $400 - 2.0%; >$400 to $425 - 2.25%; >$425 - 2.5%.

(9)The royalty is capped at $10 million. As of June 30, 2016, royalty payments of approximately $4.2 million have been received.
(10)The 1.0% to 2.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty will pay 2.0% when the price of gold is above $350 per ounce and 1.0% when the price of gold falls to $350 per ounce or below. The 0.6% to 0.9% NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $300 - 0.6%; $300 to $350 - 0.7%; > $350 to $400 - 0.8%; > $400 -0.9%. The silver royalty rate is based on the price of gold.
(11)The 0.6% to 0.9% sliding-scale NSR applies to the M-ACE claims. The operator did not break out reserves or resources subject to the M-ACE claims royalty.
(12)Royalty only applies to Section 29 which currently holds about 95% of the reserves reported for the property. An additional Cordilleran royalty applies to a portion of Section 28.
(13)Additional Rayrock royalties apply to Sections 28, 32 and 33; these royalty rates vary depending on pre-existing royalties. The Rayrock royalties take effect once 200,000 ounces of gold have been produced from open pit mines on the property. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 103,000 ounces have been produced.
(14)Royalty is capped at $300,000 plus simple interest.
(15)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to under $350 - 0.0%; $350 to under $400 - 0.5%; $400 to under $500 - 1.0%; $500 or higher-2.0%.
(16)Goose Lake royalty applies to production above 400,000 ounces.
(17)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $350 - 1.0%; above $350 - 1.5%.
(18)Thompson Creek will deliver 52.25% of gold produced, at a purchase price equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce delivered or the prevailing spot price.
(19)New Gold will deliver: (a) gold in amounts equal to 6.50% of gold produced until 230,000 ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% of gold produced thereafter, and (b) silver in amounts equal to 60% of silver produced until 3.10 million ounces have been delivered, and 30% of silver produced thereafter, in each case at a purchase price equal to 25% of the spot price per ounce delivered.
(20)The Company's royalty is subject to a 2.0 million ounce cap on gold production. There have been approximately 1.55 million ounces of cumulative production as of June 30, 2016. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $299.99 - 1.0%; $300 to $324.99 - 1.50%; $325 to $349.99 - 2.0%; $350 to $374.99 - 3.0%; $375 to $399.99 - 4.0%; $400 or higher-5.0%.
(21)Operator reports reserves by material type. The sulfide material will be processed by milling. The oxide material will be processed by heap leaching.
