ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 72 Malls and non-controlling interests in 9 Malls as of December 31, 2014. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.
We classify our regional Malls into four categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass, which opened in July 2014, The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta, which opened in July 2013, and The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City, which opened in August 2011, were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2014. The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta and The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2013.
(3)
Non-core Malls - Malls where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, which may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, we have determined that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. Similar criteria apply to the classification of an Associated Center or Community Center as a Non-core Property. The steps taken to reposition Non-core Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of Non-core Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Non-core Properties. Madison Square was classified as a Non-core Mall as of December 31, 2014. Columbia Place, Citadel Mall, Chapel Hill Mall and Madison Square were classified as Non-core Malls as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, Madison Plaza, an Associated Center adjacent to Madison Square, was classified as a Non-core Property as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The foreclosure of Citadel Mall was completed in the first quarter of 2014. Chapel Hill Mall and Columbia Place were conveyed to the respective lenders holding the non-recourse mortgage loans secured by these Properties, in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively.
(4)
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on the terms of the loan secured by the related Property. As of December 31, 2014, Gulf Coast Town Center and Triangle Town Center were classified as Lender Malls. Additionally, Triangle Town Place, an Associated Center adjacent to Triangle Town Center, was classified as a Lender Property as of December 31, 2014. Lender Properties are excluded from our same-center pool because they are under cash management agreements with the respective servicers. As such, the respective servicer controls the cash flow of these Properties.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Walnut Square, WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Brookfield Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, Wausau Center and EastGate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.

(25)
Mall stores sales per square foot and occupancy percentage are not applicable as the steps taken to reposition Non-core and Lender Malls lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties.
Anchors
Anchors are an important factor in a Mall’s successful performance. The public’s identification with a mall property typically focuses on the Anchor tenants. Mall Anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.
Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to mall store tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors account for 12.9% of the total revenues from our Malls in 2014. Each Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2014, we added the following Anchors and Junior Anchors to the Malls listed below:
As of December 31, 2014, the Malls had a total of 312 Anchors, including 7 vacant Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors at our Non-core and Lender Malls and freestanding stores. The Mall Anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2014 is as follows:
(1)
Of the 31 stores owned by JC Penney, 5 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(2)
Of the 36 stores owned by Sears, 3 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company.

Of the 20 stores owned by Belk, 1 is subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(6)
Of the 2 stores owned by Bergner's, 1 is subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(7)
Of the 4 stores owned by Boston Store, 1 is subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(8)
Of the 2 stores owned by Younkers, 1 is subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(9)
Of the 2 stores owned by Nordstrom, 1 is subject to ground lease payments to the Company.

(11)
Hobby Lobby is scheduled to open in 2015 in the former JC Penney's space at Hickory Point Mall.
(12)

(1)

(2)
The former Sears building at CoolSprings Galleria is under redevelopment and will include a Belk store, H&M and others at its opening in 2015.

(4)

Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 7,603 Mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 78.2% of the occupied Mall store GLA. Although Mall stores occupy only 28.3% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 71.7% is occupied by Anchors and a minor percentage is vacant), the Malls received 81.7% of their revenues from mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2014:
(1)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable common area expenses and real estate taxes, in effect at December 31, 2014 for expiring leases that were executed as of December 31, 2014.
(2)
Total annualized gross rent, including recoverable common area expenses and real estate taxes, of expiring leases as a percentage of the total annualized gross rent of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2014.
(3)
Total GLA of expiring leases as a percentage of the total GLA of all leases that were executed as of December 31, 2014.
See page 58 for a comparison between rents on leases that expired in the current reporting period compared to rents on new and renewal leases executed in 2014. We have been successful in our efforts to upgrade our tenant mix over the past year and are continuing to focus on new tenants. We will be working in the first half of 2015 to replace tenants who made bankruptcy announcements at the end of 2014, but anticipate this will have a short-term impact on our leasing and occupancy results. For leases expiring in 2015 that we are able to renew or replace with new tenants, we anticipate that we will be able to achieve higher rental rates than the existing rates of the expiring leases as retailers seek out space in our market-dominant Properties and new supply remains constricted. Page 58 also includes new and renewal leasing activity as of December 31, 2014 with commencement dates in 2014 and 2015.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by sales. Mall store sales represents total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet. The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total Mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for the three years ended December 31, 2014:
(1)
In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls. The information in this table is based on 100% of the applicable amounts and has not been adjusted for our ownership share.
(2)
Represents reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, marketing and certain capital expenditures.

Associated Centers are retail properties that are adjacent to a regional mall complex and include one or more Anchors, or big box retailers, along with smaller tenants. Anchor tenants typically include tenants such as T.J. Maxx, Target, Kohl’s and Bed Bath & Beyond. Associated Centers are managed by the staff at the Mall since it is adjacent to and usually benefits from the customers drawn to the Mall.

Community Centers
We owned a controlling interest in six Community Centers and a non-controlling interest in five Community Centers as of December 31, 2014. Community Centers typically have less development risk because of shorter development periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain higher occupancy levels and are more stable, they typically have slower rent growth because the anchor stores’ rents are typically fixed and are for longer terms.
Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.
We own the land underlying the Community Centers in fee simple interest.
