As of December 31, 2003, the Owned Properties consisted of 147 multifamily residential communities containing 40,946 apartment units. At the time of the IPO (August 4, 1994), Home Properties owned 11 communities containing 3,065 units and simultaneously with the closing of the IPO acquired an additional four communities containing 926 units. From the time just prior to the IPO to December 31, 2003, the Company experienced a compounded annualized growth rate of 32% in the number of apartment units it owned. In 2003, Home Properties acquired 730 apartment units in two communities for a total purchase price of approximately $93 million. Also in 2003, the Company sold seven communities with a total of 1,568 units for total consideration of $59.3 million. From January 1, 2004 through March 4, 2004, the Company acquired five communities with a total of 774 units for a total purchase price of $93.6 million.
The Owned Properties are generally located in established markets in suburban neighborhoods and are well maintained and well leased. Average economic occupancy at the Owned Properties was 93% for 2003. The Owned Properties are typically two- and three-story garden style apartment buildings in landscaped settings and a majority are of brick or other masonry construction. The Company believes that its strategic focus on appealing to middle income and senior residents and the quality of the services it provides to such residents results in lower resident turnover. Average turnover at the Owned Properties was approximately 46% for 2003, which is significantly below the national average of 60.5% for garden-style apartments.
Resident leases are generally for a one year term. Security deposits equal to one month's rent are generally required.
Certain of the Owned Properties secure mortgage loans. See Schedule III contained herein (F-42 to).

Property Development --------------------
For approximately five years, from 1996 to 2000, the Company actively diversified its portfolio of market-rate communities with government assisted multifamily housing developed or re-developed by the Company. Effective December 31, 2000, the Company sold its affordable housing development operations to Conifer, LLC. Conifer, LLC is led by Richard J. Crossed, a former Executive Vice President and former director of the Company. The Company retained general partner ownership interests in and property management operations for 8,325 apartment units in 136 existing affordable communities.
In December 2002, the Company determined that it would market for sale virtually all of the assets associated with its interests in various affordable property limited partnerships. At that time, the Company announced its intention to sell the assets which include the equity interest in the affordable housing partnerships, loans, advances and management contracts, in three phases.
During 2003, the Company was successful in selling its interest in entities that own in the aggregate 84 properties containing 2,590 units. There still remains interests in entities owning 39 properties, most of which are under contract to sell in 2004. The net gain recorded from the 2003 sales was $40,000. In addition, during 2003, the Company recorded $2.5 million in impairment charges related to these assets held as general partner. A total of $822,000 represents an impairment of monies loaned during 2003 to certain affordable properties to fund operating shortfalls, which are not anticipated to be recovered from projected sales proceeds. The balance of the impairment charge, or $1.7 million, pertains to a charge taken in the third quarter to reduce the book value of certain assets associated with the remaining interest. This was triggered by the negotiation and signing of a sale contract for these assets.
The Company has retained the ability to develop new market rate communities, but does not plan to focus on this activity. Rather, it plans to engage in development activity only on a very selective basis.
Property Management -------------------
As of December 31, 2003, the Managed Properties consist of: (i) 4,832 apartment units where Home Properties is the general partner of the entity that owns the property; and (ii) 2,302 apartment units managed for others. The 4,832 apartment units where the Company is the general partner are projected to be sold during 2004 as referred to above under the Property Development section.
On January 1, 2004, the Company sold certain assets of its commercial property management division to Home Leasing LLC, which is owned by the Leenhoutses. This division managed approximately 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, as well as certain planned communities. The majority of the managed commercial properties are and have been owned in whole or in part by the Leenhoutses since before the Company's IPO in 1994. The sale was completed in order to permit the Company to focus solely on the direct ownership and management of market rate apartment communities. The contribution from the commercial property management division to Home Properties' 2003 earnings was significantly less than one-half of one percent. The initial amount paid was $67,500. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive a percentage of the management fee received by Home Leasing in connection with the management of one of the commercial properties for a period not to exceed 36 months. If Home Leasing continues to manage that property for three years, the Company is expected to receive an additional deferred purchase price of $166,000, for a total consideration of $233,500. If the management of this property is retained for the entire three years, the gain on sale will be approximately $30,000.
The Company may pursue the management of additional properties not owned by the Company, but will only do so when such additional properties can be effectively and efficiently managed in conjunction with other properties owned or managed by Home Properties.
