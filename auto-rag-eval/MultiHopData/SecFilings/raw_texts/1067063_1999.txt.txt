(3) Total base rent for 1999 minus total 1999 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP. (4) Base rent for 1999 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 1999. For those properties acquired or placed in service during 1999, amounts are annualized, as per Note 7. (5) Effective rent for 1999 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 1999. For those properties acquired or placed in service during 1999, amounts are annualized, as per Note 7. (6) Excludes space leased by the Operating Partnership aggregating 122,149 square feet. (7) As this property was acquired or placed in service by the Operating Partnership during 1999, the amounts represented in 1999 base rent and 1999 effective rent reflect only that portion of the year during which the Operating Partnership owned or placed the property in service. Accordingly, these amounts may not be indicative of the property's full year results. For comparison purposes, the amounts represented in 1999 average base rent per sq. ft. and 1999 average effective rent per sq. ft. for this property have been calculated by taking 1999 base rent and 1999 effective rent for such property and annualizing these partial-year results, dividing such annualized amounts by the net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 1999. These annualized per square foot amounts may not be indicative of the property's results had the Operating Partnership owned or placed such property in service for the entirety of 1999.
