Fencemaker Claims, Pershing County, NV
Location and Access
The Fencemaker Project is located approximately 194 kilometers northeast of the city of Reno, Nevada, and more locally approximately 60 kilometers east-southeast of the town of Lovelock, in the west central part of the state of Nevada, southwestern United States. The five (5) mining claims total 100 acres (40.47 hectares), and are referred to in general as the Fencemaker Mine. They are situated in the center of Table Mountain, northeastern Stillwater Range, Pershing County, State of Nevada. The approximate position of the property is Latitude 40° 04’20.03"N, Longitude 117° 51'36.25" W. All of the claims are in sections 31, Township 26 and section 6, Township 25 North, both in Range 37 East (T26N, R37E; T25, R37E); Mount Diablo Base and Meridian (MDB&M) + (Mine Area) Pershing County, Nevada (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). These certificates are duly recorded in book 146 at the Pershing County, Nevada Recorder’s Office and the B.L.M. Winnemucca, NV, Notice N82695. The sorting/processing plant is located at Section 32, Township 28 N, Range 32 E, Pershing County and covers 111.8 acres (45.24 hectares).
Access to the Fencemaker Project is by paved two-lane Hwy. 80 north-northeast from Lovelock for a distance of 10 kilometers, and then turning east onto East Coal Canyon Road and tertiary roads for an additional 61 kilometers to the Fencemaker minesite. The sorting/processing plant is on the west side of Hwy. 80 at the turnoff to East Coal Canyon Road.
Regional & Property Geology
Regional geology is shown below. The Fencemaker property lies in the west-central part of the Great Basin, which in turn is part of the Basin and Range Physiographic Province. The Great Basin is characterized by north-northeast trending mountain ranges separated by wide flat valleys. In this part of Nevada, the ranges are generally made up of Mesozoic and Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The Great Basin is characterized by internal drainage and a long period of episodic magmatism.
Paleozoic rocks of the Great Basin are primarily sedimentary rocks deposited along a continental margin. The early Paleozoic was a relatively quiescent geological time in the Great Basin, with slow eastward advancement of the shoreline. The Antler Orogeny deformation began in the Devonian and lasted through the mid-Mississippian. This orogeny caused uplift to the west, producing later waning of sedimentation. It imposed low angle regional scale tectonics, causing siliciclastic rocks to be thrust over the carbonate sequence. The Sonoma Orogeny of Permian/Triassic age again thrust Mesozoic age siliciclastic, turbidites, carbonates and volcanic rocks over the Antler assemblages of the eastern assemblage.
The Mesozoic sedimentary rocks have been classified into five major depositional groups of strata (Johnson, 1977). The basal Koipato Group is comprised of nonmarine volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Unconformably overlying this is the Star Peak Group, comprised of laterally interfingering limestones and dolostones. Overlying this is a thick sequence of clastic rocks, the Auld Lang Syne Group. The youngest Mesozoic unit is a pure quartzite referred to as the Boyer Ranch Formation. Mesozoic plutonic rocks are of four ages: 1) Early Triassic leucogranites and intrusive rhyolite porphyry, 2) Jurassic granodiorite and gabbro; 3) early Late Cretaceous granodiorite, and; 4) Late Cretaceous granodiorite and quartz monzonite.
Cenozoic rocks in Pershing County consist of sedimentary and volcanic sequences, including andesite and basalt flows, tuffaceous sediments and minor tuff units. These widespread volcanic and volcaniclastic units were deposited over much of central and western Nevada. By mid- Cenozoic time volcanic ash, ash flows and ash flow tuffs from numerous vent areas covered the pre-Cenozoic age rocks. Following the extrusion of these large amounts of volcanic material, extensional tectonics caused collapse that formed the numerous circular calderas that occur across much of Nevada’s Great Basin. In the Quaternary, Lake Lahontan, a large fresh water lake, was formed and covered most of central and western Nevada. Walker Lake, Pyramid Lake and several smaller lakes all exhibit internal drainage and are all that remain of the widespread Lake Lahontan (Wilson, S.E., 2010).
The compressional Laramide Orogeny (including Sonoma) occurred from Late Mesozoic (Cretaceous) to Early Cenozoic. By the Oligocene (mid-Cretaceous, approximately 30 ma) the major tectonic component had changed to extension and about 19 Ma the characteristic “basin and range” topography was formed. These extensional normal and listric faults bound most of the north to northeast trending ranges of the Great Basin and cut the major Antler and Laramide structures.
The property is situated in the center of the Table Mountain range, part of the much longer Stillwater Range of southwestern Pershing County. Permian to Early Triassic Koipato andesite flows and rhyolite tuffs and flows cap (are overthrust upon?) Late Triassic Dun Glen Formation dolomites of Auld Lang Syne Group (Burke and Silberling, 1973). Minor Tertiary sediments and tuffs may also be present. Cretaceous quartz monzonite and/or granodiorite in the immediate area may be the heat source for circulating hydrothermal metal-enriched fluids.
The Fencemaker project has not been mapped in any detail. The Mine is hosted in calcareous siltstone dolostone) of the Late Triassic Dun Glen Formation, part of the Auld Lang Syne Group. The host formation has experienced thermal metamorphism and recrystallization as shown by the coarsely crystalline marble near the mine portal. A diabase dike was reported nearby (Lawrence, 1963, pgs. 192, 193 as reported in Johnson, 1977, p. 94) but not observed during the site visit. A brief examination of the rock above the mine workings showed rusty/buff colored hematized rhyolite. Pervasive reddish brown weathering suggests andesite flows of Koipato Group. Alternately this alteration could occur along the limestone/volcanic contact.
The regional geology map (Figure 5) shows several major N-S and NNE-SSW high-angle structures in the area. These could be either high-angle imbricate faults or part of the listric and normal fault system related to extension. One or more of these probably acted as conduits for the movement of mineralizing fluids. The structure at the minesite follows an east to southeast (105o to 120o steeply south dipping (75o south-southwest) fault zone which also follows a narrow diabase dike.
Exploration
The recommended Phase 1 drill program was initiated on July 12, 2012 to test the strike and down-dip continuity of Sb mineralization known to be present at surface in the Fencemaker Mine. A total of thirteen (13) Reverse Circulation (RC) holes were drilled to a maximum depth of 235 feet (71.6 meters) below surface.
The drill program was supervised by Dr. Duncan Bain, P.Geo., who did the initial site visit and report in March 2012. The program was managed in the field by Mr. Kim Craig, a seasoned U.S. geologist with many years of experience working in Nevada.
Phase 1 drilling commenced on July 13 using a single Reverse Circulation drill supplied by National Exploration based in Elko, Nevada. The reverse circulation drill bores a hole 5 ½ inches (140 mm) in diameter. Thirteen (13) holes totaling 2350 feet (716.28 m) were drilled to intersect the known mineralization downdip from known mineralization and to explore for extension of the mineralized zone along strike of the known mineralization. Locations of drill holes are presented in Table 2 and Figures 7. Sections are shown on Figures 8 to 14. The holes were spotted with a global positioning system unit and the azimuths were set using a Brunton compass. Water was delivered to the drill sites by a water truck from a well drilled 250 feet (80 m) to the west.
Sample was in the form of chips collected in sample bags taken by the drill crew under the supervision of the geologist Mr. Craig. Each sample contained chips from a 5 foot (~1.5 m) interval from beginning to end down each hole. Each sample was tagged at the drill by the drill core. These samples were delivered to a secure core site close to the drill. Here they were given new sample numbers by the geologist to maintain independence from the numbers given by the drill crew. The chips from each sample interval were examined by the geologist to look for Sb mineralization, both in the interval expected to contain continuation of the mineralization known at surface, and any new zones of potential Sb mineralization. The longest sample taken within any geological unit was 5 feet (1.5) meters.
Each sample from the drill weighed approximately 20 pounds (~10 kg). Sample material was reduced down by a splitter to approximately 3-4 pounds (1.5-2.0 kg). Following examination by the geologist the samples from each interval considered to contain Sb mineralization and two (2 X 5 feet) samples on either side of those intervals were put into plastic bag. Each five (5) foot (1.5 m) sample went into an individual bag with a numbered sample ticket on each bag. The corresponding sample number was written on the outside of the bag with a waterproof marker. The remainder of each original sample was retained and stored in a secure site, available for re-sampling and additional examination.

Drilling to confirm continuity of Sb mineralization was successful.
Drillhole Samples and Assay Results
SAMPLING METHODS AND APPROACH
Drill chip sampling was supervised by the Mr. Craig, the geologist on site. As the drilling was performed using a Reverse Circulation machine no core was extracted. Instead rock chips were produced and collected by the drill crew. A sample of chips was taken of 5 foot (1.5 m) sections from top to bottom of hole. Each sample was examined by the geologist on site, and a brief drill log was made. From this information the geologist selected samples which he considered likely to contain antimony mineralization, in the form of stibnite. The sample numbering 1 to 195 was for the first examination of sample material from all holes. Assay results led to a review of samples to test intervals that appeared to contain mineralization not recognized in the initial examination. This led to additional samples being selected, and are labeled 1a to 80a. All samples were split and reduced down to a sample 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1.0 kg) in weight. Each of these samples was placed in a plastic bag with an identifying numbered sample tag and the bag was tied shut. The sample number was also written on the outside of the plastic sample bag and the samples were placed in larger bags not exceeding 20 kilograms in weight for transport to the laboratory. The sample number was also entered into the geologic log at the appropriate down hole interval. A total of 195 samples of 5 foot (1.5 m) intervals were sampled and samples were submitted to the laboratory for assaying.
Two duplicate samples were submitted to the same lab to check for nugget effect. To check the lab accuracy every 20th sample submitted was a blank sample. Blanks consisted of samples taken from an outcrop of massive siltstone located approximately five kilometres to the west. Standards were also analyzed. Only five (5) standards were submitted as the availability of standards of high-grade Sb are very rare.
Samples were delivered by one of the company’s representatives to a globally recognized ISO certified laboratory (ALS-Chemex Labs) in Reno for assaying. All samples were of rock chips and weighed an average of one to kilogram.
SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
Samples were taken by the author, with a label placed inside each bag. Samples were then sealed and the sample number was written ofn the outside of each bag. They were transported to Reno, where they were shipped by courier to the ALS Group Sample Preparation office in Reno. Assay results were requested to be sent only to the author. Sample and analysis methods are described below:
PREP-31B
The sample is logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried and finely crushed to better than 70 % passing a 2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std. No.10) screen. A split of up to 1000 g is taken and pulverized to better than 85 % passing a 75 micron (Tyler 200 mesh) screen. This method is appropriate for rock chip or drill samples.
ME-ICP41
The sample is digested in a mixture of nitric, perchloric and hydrofluoric acids. Perchloric acid is added to assist oxidation of the sample and to reduce the possibility of mechanical loss of sample as the solution is evaporated to moist salts. Elements are determined by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Four acid digestions are able to dissolve most minerals; however, although the term “near complete” is used, depending on the sample matrix, not all elements are quantitatively extracted.
Au-AA23
Samples were tested for low grade but anomalous Au with this method. This consisted of Fire Assay with an Atomic Absorption finish of a 30 g sample.
Sb-AA08
Ore grade sample were re-analyzed for Sb using this method. This involved a more complete 4 acid leach and Atomic Absorption analysis.
All pulps have been retained by the lab on an ongoing basis. Rejects were discarded.
Lida Valley Property
A) Lithium Agreement:
Claims
On May 31, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with GeoXplor Corp. (“Lithium Agreement”). Under this Lithium Agreement, we have been granted an exclusive four year exploration license in regards to the two mineral properties described in the Lithium Agreement. One property encompasses 58 placer claims (9280 acres) located in Lida Valley, Esmeralda County, Nevada for Lithium and Lithium Carbonate exploration (the "Lida Valley Property"), and the other encompasses 70 placer claims (11,200 acres) located in Smokey Valley, Esmeralda County, Nevada for Lithium and Lithium Carbonate exploration (the "Smokey Valley Property"). These requirements apply to both the Lida Valley Property and the Smokey Valley Property, and the Work Program requirements may be allocated to the respective properties at the discretion of the Company.

The election to obtain cash or shares of First Liberty shall be at the sole election of GeoXplor.
Lida Valley Claims, Esmeralda County, NV
Location and Access
The Lida Valley Property is located in South Western Nevada, approximately 150 miles north of Las Vegas and within 15 miles of the Montezuma peak. The project area has excellent infrastructure including a network of roads, railroads and cellular telephone coverage.
Regional & Property Geology
Lida Valley is one of a group of inter-mountain basins in west-central Nevada and is surrounded by Cuprite Hills to the Northwest, Stonewall Mountains to the East and Slate Ridge to the Southwest. It has a playa floor of about 12 square miles that receives surface drainage from an area of about 60 square miles. The playa floor contains erosion remnants of Lithium-rich rhyolite tuff and is surrounded by alluvial fan slopes of the mountain ranges. Altitudes range from 4,630 feet on the playa floor to 7,000 feet on the Stonewall Ridge.
The tertiary volcanic rocks are considered to be involved in the origin of the Lithium deposits in south-central Nevada. The volcanism that created the volcanic rocks also provided the heat energy and hydrothermal activity required to mobilize the Lithium from volcanic glass and other relatively unstable minerals. The Tertiary rhyolites from the Montezuma Range and surrounding mountain ranges are considered to be the most lithium rich rhyolites in the world, (MacDonald et. Al; 1992) Transport of the Lithium would require a hydrothermal fluid, surface water or meteoric groundwater. Evaporation concentrated the Lithium in the brine to economic grades which are considered to be in the 100 to 300 ppm range. The Lithium rich water would also alter the playa sediments to form Lithium-rich clays and Lithium rich inclusions in halite.
Exploration
In March of 2010, the Company commissioned a gravity survey on the Lida Valley Property, total cost of $85,287, undertaken by Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc. of Prescott, Arizona, which report was completed in June 2010. The gravity survey was conducted for lithium brine exploration over claims Lida Valley Property. The purpose of the survey was to map depth to bedrock or thickness of sediments, map any geologic structures that may be significant to the occurrence of lithium brine, and provide information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys.
Interpretation of the modeled gravity data indicates several areas with increased bedrock depths or lower bedrock elevations. These areas may be conducive for concentration of lithium-bearing brines, but the presence, dip and continuity of aquifer beds plus the detailed mapping of any structures both within the sedimentary section and bedrock should be determined through high resolution geophysical means prior to drilling.
In order to further detail on the above gravity survey, a 2nd gravity survey was commissioned for a cost of $22,000, which was completed in August 2010.
Based on the positive indicators found from the two gravity survey reports, two geophysical approaches were recommended in areas selected from the gravity surveys: 1) controlled-source audiomagnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSAMT/MT) surveys, and 2) reflection seismic surveys. It was recommended that the CSAMT/MT surveys be conducted because they will determine if conductive zones, possibly indicative of lithium-bearing brines, are present and continuous. Additionally these surveys may help define aquifer dip.
Based on the above recommendation, the Company engaged GeoXplor, in association with Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc., to undertake the CSAMT/MT surveys. The work was completed and a report provided to the Company in February 2011, for a total cost of $112,500. As with the previous two geophysical surveys conducted, the results were positive, and include having identified areas of potential lithium brine deposits. The mapping indicated a geologic stratigraphy and structure relative to the occurrence of lithium brine, and identified conductors that are thought to be representative of lithium-bearing brine, thus providing information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys or the identification of drilling locations.
Collectively, the three reports show several clear targets for further exploratory investigations. Drilling targets in both the southern end of the Property and in the northern area of the playa have been located based on the identification of several areas showing areas of low resistivity. The complete reports from Hasbrouck Geophysics from all exploration stages on the Property are currently available at the Company’s website, www.firstlibertystrategic.com.
Based on these results, in May 2011, the Company determined that the best and most efficient approach is to bypass seismic surveys, and proceed directly to a 3 - 5 hole drilling program, and therefore requested a work program estimate from GeoXplor, which has now been presented to the Company in October 2011. The drill program, estimated at 3000m total, will target areas of significant Lithium brine potential identified by the Company's exploration program (i.e., areas marked by gravity lows and low resistivity) through certain initial holes followed by the remaining holes depending on first results. By penetrating the formations comprising the basin fill in the Lida Valley Property, the drill results will allow the Company to identify the concentration, if any, of Lithium and other constituents in the groundwater in these target zones. GeoXplor Corp., who will perform the drilling, estimates that each hole will require one week's time, with a budgeted cost of $343,000.
The Company is required to undertake a combined total of approximately $1,500,000 worth of work on the Lida Valley Property and Smokey Valley Property prior to December 2014. The next steps for exploration, over the next year, are expected to be the drill program as indicated above. If the results are positive for the drill program, we will base our next phase exploration program on those results, though we would expect additional drilling to be involved.
As of July 31, 2012 and to date, the exploration work undertaken has provided continued positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are as of yet no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Lida Valley Property in order to determine if a commercially viable reserve does exist.
At present, the Company does not have sufficient funds for the planned drill program, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock. While initial arrangements have been made to accomplish the raising of additional funds, and the Company expects to be able to raise the required funds for the next phases of the exploration program, our success in doing so cannot be assured.
Smokey Valley Claims, Esmeralda County, NV
Location and Access
The Smokey Valley Property is also located in South Western Nevada, approximately 170 miles north of Las Vegas and within 15 miles of the Montezuma peak, positioned North-West as opposed to South, as is the Lida Valley Property. The project area, off highway 265 approximately 5 miles from Silver Creek road, the location of the lithium producing Chemetall Foote project, has excellent infrastructure including a network of paved roads, railroads and cellular telephone coverage.
Regional & Property Geology
The Smokey Valley Property, adjacent to Clayton Valley, is also located in one of a group of inter-mountain basins in west-central Nevada and is surrounded by Cuprite Hills to the Northwest, Stonewall Mountains to the East and Slate Ridge to the Southwest. It has a playa floor of an estimated 15 square miles that receives surface drainage from an area of about 140 square miles.

In the 1970’s USGS conducted a gravity survey covering Clayton Valley and the valley connecting Clayton Valley to Big Smoky where the Smokey Valley Property claims are located. The resulting maps show a relationship between the brine field in Clayton Valley and the deepest parts of the valley. The map also suggests that there is a height of bedrock between the Smokey Valley claims and Clayton Valley which may act as a barrier for water moving from Big Smokey Valley to Clayton Valley. The USGS performed two exploratory drill holes in Big Smokey Valley, (not on Smokey Valley Property) as part of a program to evaluate the lithium resource potential of the basins adjacent to Clayton Valley. Hole BS13 was terminated to 675 feet, Lithium in sediments ranged from 48-365ppm averaging 160ppm, lithium in water ranged from 100-1,700ppb. Hole BS14 was terminated at 215 feet. Lithium in sediments ranged from 40-287ppm, averaging 150ppm, lithium in water ranged from 820-1300ppb. These results were of indicative of the validity of additional work being performed on the Smoky Valley Property.
In February 2011, Hasbrouck Geophysics conducted a preliminary controlled source audio magnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSMAT/MT), the purpose of the survey was to determine if conductors that might be representative of lithium-bearing brine were present near a previously identified low value gravity anomaly. This geophysical survey indicated the presence of predominant zones of lower resistivities, which are interpreted as salty, water-saturated sediments or highly fractured bedrock, of sufficient extent and depth to further warrant additional exploration activity.
In May 2012, First Liberty commissioned a Gravity Survey report at a cost of $74,000, which survey was completed by July 2012.
A total of 116 separate gravity stations were acquired along seven profiles, as shown in Figure 1, at nominal line and station spacings of one kilometer. The station locations were first located on a topographic map, uploaded to a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS), and then staked in the field. Elevations of individual stations were acquired in the field with a Trimble GeoXH GPS unit and confirmed with elevations taken from USGS topographic maps. Because the survey was considered reconnaissance in nature, the generally better than one-half meter elevation accuracies of the stations were considered adequate.
From results of previous modeling conducted in the general area by the report author and other investigators, a density contrast between valley fill sediments and Paleozoic bedrock of 0.5 g/cm3 was chosen to best represent a two-layer case. All lines, except number 1, extended to outcrop at the beginning and/or ending stations and thus the depth to bedrock at those stations was considered as zero for modeling purposes. The middle of survey line number 1 was located near the base of the prominent cinder cone in the area with the idea that bedrock might be near the surface. The most accurate depth modeling results would require bedrock depths from drilling along the line(s) as constraints in the modeling. Since the survey was considered essentially reconnaissance, lines with identified bedrock outcrop at either or both ends were considered sufficiently accurate for the purposes of the survey.
There are two main factors that must be considered regarding target areas for lithium mineralization and concentration: 1) where is the source of the lithium, and 2) does a basin environment exist for the concentration of the lithium transported by meteoric water from the source In the Clayton Valley region it is thought that the source of the lithium is the dark gray lithium enriched rhyolite tuffs that outcrop near Montezuma Peak. Once lithium has been liberated into the water system it remains highly mobile and movement of the lithium with surface water and groundwater will follow basic hydrological principles. Hydrologic basins in Nevada consist of basin fill underlain by either low-permeability or permeable rock with water movement through the basin fill, permeable rock and along faults. Nothing more complex than a topographic low or closed basin is required to concentrate lithium-bearing water. For topographic lows with larger catchment areas there is a greater opportunity to accumulate lithium from wider sources. The water trapped in these lows may move through dipping aquifers until it reaches an impermeable barrier such as a fault scarp.
The complete Bouguer gravity map shown in Figure 2 is contoured from the total 116 stations, using Golden Software’s Surfer computer program (version 10.7.972), with a Bouguer slab density of 2.67 g/cm3. The bedrock depth map can be thought of as a thickness of sediments map, but because the surface elevation within the gravity survey area varies then the bedrock elevation map can often be more useful for identification of low bedrock areas.
If one reasonably assumes that lithium source material and transport mechanisms for this gravity survey area are present and similar to those that have supplied Clayton Valley lithium-bearing brines then areas with lower bedrock elevations (i.e., bedrock topographic lows) may be conducive to increased lithium-bearing brines concentration. Increased bedrock depth, or increased sedimentary thickness, and lower bedrock elevations that form a basin are present in the approximate middle of the survey area. This bedrock topographic low appears to be closed off to the south, but remains open to the north. The deepest portion of the bedrock low is modeled as about 1,850 meters below ground surface (bgs), or approximately -300 meters elevation, along line 7. Because no drilling results are available to those depths, the gravity modeling depths should be considered approximate. However, it is important that the gravity modeling results indicate the presence of a deep basin that extends over a large area particularly if an arbitrary depth of 600 meters is chosen to represent the boundaries of the basin. With such a large catchment area there is a greater opportunity to accumulate lithium from wider sources. On both the bedrock depth and elevation maps it appears that an additional small, closed basin at a depth of about 900 meters is present near the eastern one-third of line 3 (essentially centered between stations 313 and 314). Somewhat similarly, an anomalous area is present at about the western one-third of line 4 (near station 405) and also approximately three to four kilometers from the western beginning of line 7 (between about stations 705 and 706). These additional anomalous areas may or may not be related to the main bedrock topographic low. From these profiles (either A-A’ or BA’) it is apparent that significantly shallower bedrock is located at the southern end of the geophysically surveyed area, while the bedrock continues to deepen to the northern extent of the survey area.
Based on the interpretation of the modeled gravity data indicates a large topographic low, or basin, that appears to be closed off to the south but remains open to the north. This extensive basin area may be favorable for the accumulation of lithium-bearing brines, but additional investigations need to be conducted. Additional geophysical surveys will further determine the structure of the basin identified in this survey, and map the presence, dip and continuity of conductive zones within the basin.
Recommended additional geophysical surveys prior to drilling are: 1) extend the gravity survey along line 1 to the west and east and add one additional line one kilometer south of line 1 to better define the indicated southern basin closure, 2) acquire additional gravity data along at least two lines to the north, separated by one kilometer each, to determine if the basin closes in that direction, and 3) conduct controlled-source audio-magnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSAMT / MT) surveys in selected areas from the gravity survey(s) to determine if conductive zones, possibly indicative of lithium-bearing brines, are present and if so then to map the dip and continuity of those aquifer beds. It is estimated that to satisfy items number 1 and 2 above that approximately 60 additional gravity stations will be required. It is anticipated that nominally 100 CSAMT / MT stations will be sufficient to satisfy item number 3 above. After additional gravity data and new CSAMT / MT data are acquired, processed and interpreted then either reflection seismic surveys or drilling can be conducted. The reflection seismic surveys will detail any possible lithium-bearing brines beds (e.g., similar to the Main Ash and Lower Gravel Aquifers, amongst others, in Clayton Valley) and will map structure in greater detail than the other geophysical techniques.
At present, the Company does not have sufficient funds for the planned additional exploration program, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock. While initial arrangements have been made to accomplish the raising of additional funds, and the Company expects to be able to raise the required funds for the next phases of the exploration program, our success in doing so cannot be assured.
B) Uravan Claims, San Juan Country, Utah (“Van-Ur Property”)
On November 6, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with GeoXplor Corp. (“Agreement”). Under this Agreement, we have been granted an exclusive five year exploration license in regards to a mineral property described in the Agreement. The mineral property encompasses 13 lode claims (260 acres) located in the Canyon Country District, San Juan County, Utah for Vanadium and Uranium exploration (the "San Juan Property"). Pursuant to the Agreement, upon the completion of the required payments and work commitments, GeoXplor shall transfer title to the San Juan Property to the Company and shall retain a 3% royalty, on which we shall have the option to purchase up to 2%, for $1,000,000 per 1%.
We are required to (1) make cash payments of $500,000 over a five year period; (2) issue a total of 3,000,000 restricted shares of common stock over a five year period; and (3) comply with a work commitment of $1,000,000 within three years.
The San Juan Property encompasses certain claims previously included in agreements between the Company and GeoXplor, and this Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior agreements in respect to those claims.
The Company is in default on its obligations under the Agreement. Through to the fiscal year end and date of this report, the Company has not yet achieved a formal extension and settlement agreement. However, the Company believes it will be possible to obtain such an agreement on terms acceptable to all parties.
Location and Access
The Uravan Property is located in the northeast corner of San Juan County approximately 40 miles southeast of Moab, Utah. The area is sparsely populated with a small village of La Sal, Utah, about 10 miles west of the claim block. Utah Highway 46, an all-weather paved road provides access to the southern region of the mineral claims. A network of forest roads, drill access roads and jeep trails make most of the claim block accessible year round.
The climate of San Juan County is semi-arid with minor precipitation. The average annual precipitation is 12.83 inches with an average snowfall of 44.5 inches. The snowfalls during November to May occasionally reach 15 inches or more. The Uravan Property is located in the high desert ecosystem with erosional landscape exposing the sandstone formations. Deep canyons with canyon walls composed of alternating erosion-resistant benches and highly erodible slopes, and broad flat benches are the predominant landscape features. Vegetation consists of greasewood, salt bush, rabbit bush with willows and cottonwood in the drainage area.
Regional & Property Geology
The Uravan Mineral claims are located within the Colorado Plateau near the Utah-Colorado border. The Colorado Plateau is a broad area of regional uplift consisting mainly of flat-lying Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. The strata is gently folded and faulted by uplift, intrusion and collapse of plastic evaporite formations on the east and by intrusion of laccolithic complexes now composing the La Sal Mountains on the west.
The uranium-vanadium deposits in the La Sal quadrangle occur in the uppermost sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The ore bearing sandstone range in thickness from a few feet to 100 feet. The sandstone is a medium to fine grained quartzose interbedded with siltstone and mudstone. Near the uranium-vanadium mineralization, the sandstone is white, light gray or light brown, and the siltstone and mudstone are usually light green or gray green.
The uranium-vanadium deposits mined in the nearby producing mines occur in the uppermost sandstone beds within the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation. This unit is commonly called the ore-bearing sandstone or third rim in reference to its position above the Entrada Sandstone.
The ore-bearing sandstone is composed of a single broad lens of cross-laminated sandstone ranging from 0 to 30 feet in thickness. In other areas it is composed of overlapping sandstone lenses which have a combined thickness of 30 to 100 feet. The cross-laminated sandstone appears to have been deposited in a flood-plain environment. Scour and fill bedding consisting of cross-bedded sandstone lenses truncated by and direct contact with other truncated lenses separated by thin discontinuous mudstone lenses or mudstone conglomerate. Fragments of fossil wood are abundant in the scour and fill beds and occur either along the bedding planes or in pot like masses called “trash pockets”.
Exploration
A radon survey was completed on the Uravan Mineral Claims during September, 2009. The theory of radon soil surveys is based on the element radon which is a radioactive daughter product of uranium decay. Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium, a product of uranium and thorium decay in rocks and soils. Theoretically, radon-222 concentrations in soil should be directly related to the uranium content of the minerals in the soil and rocks. Radon is a daughter product of uranium-238 and a non-reactive, highly mobile gas that migrates away from the site of its uranium parent by diffusion and advection along joints, faults, and intergranular permeable pathways.
The magnitude of a radon anomaly associated with a parent concentration of uranium will be due to the size and grade of the parent body. Dispersion and dilution along the pathways to the surface increase the size of the radon footprint but also reduce the magnitude. The location of the anomaly relative to the uranium body will be strongly influenced by the orientation of the pathways to the surface.
The radon survey uses a system that measures the radon by utilizing an ion chamber with a electrically charged Teflon, called an electret, located inside an electrically conducting plastic chamber of known air volume. The electrets serve as a source of high voltage needed for the chamber to operate as an ion chamber. It also serves as a sensor for the measurement of ionization in air. The ions produced inside the sensitive volume of the chamber are collected by the electrets causing a depletion of charge. The measurement of the depleted charge during the exposure period is a measure of integrated ionization during the measurement period. The electrets charge is read before and after the exposure using a specially built non-contact electret voltage reader.
The Uravan mineral claims radon survey consisted of 101 readings with a minimum reading of 0.35 and a maximum reading of 27.75. The median reading was 6.75 with a midrange of 14.05. The grid results were then contoured and presented in the attached report. Proposed drill locations have also been located and presented on the following map.
The preliminary radon survey data indicates an anomalous east-west radiometric trend. The size of the anomalies appears to be similar to the size of the high grade vanadium-uranium beds mined from the Firefly, Gray Daun and Vanadium Queen Mine. A detailed radon survey would define drill targets and thereby, delineate tonnage and grade within the Uravan Claim Block.
Data compiled from mining activity and regional studies indicates ground considered favorable for Vanadium-Uranium mineralization has the following features:
•
Sandstone beds over 30 feet in thickness with a light brown to light gray color with a medium to fine grain size.
•
The sandstone contains carbonaceous material and a gray or grayish-green mudstone.
•
The beds contain mudstone as a film, pebbles or seams.
•
The sandstone is overlain by gray, greenish-gray or green mudstone
As of July 31, 2013, the exploration conducted to date has provided positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Van-Ur Property.
As the Company is no longer in possession of this property as at July 31, 2013, the provided data is for historical reference only.
