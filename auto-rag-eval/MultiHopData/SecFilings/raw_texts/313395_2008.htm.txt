ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Our administrative offices are located at 777 E. Sonterra Blvd., Suite 350, San Antonio, Texas. These offices, consisting of approximately 25,400 square feet, are leased through March 2014 at $0.6 million per year. Additionally, we have an office in the Houston area, consisting of about 6,600 square feet that is leased through August 2012 at $0.1 million per year.
All our oil and natural gas properties, reserves, and activities are located onshore in the continental United States; except for one property acquired with the Output acquisition in 2007 that is located offshore in shallow federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. There are no quantities of oil or natural gas subject to long-term supply or similar agreements with foreign government authorities.
PROVED RESERVES, FUTURE NET REVENUE AND
PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES
The following unaudited information as of December 31, 2008, relates to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, estimated future net revenues attributable to those reserves and the present value of the future net revenues using a 10% discount factor ("PV-10 Value"). Our independent reservoir-engineering firms, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and William M. Cobb & Associates, Inc., both Dallas-based worldwide petroleum-consulting firms, made these estimates for 2005 through 2008. Estimates of proved developed oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our interest at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are set forth in Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
The PV-10 Value is based on the estimated future net revenues, as prepared by our independent reservoir engineering firms in accordance with SFAS No. 69. Accordingly, the estimate is net of estimated production, future development costs and future outflows related to asset retirement obligations, and does not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expenses or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. PV-10 Value generally differs from the standardized measure by the present value of estimated income taxes.
Oil prices used in PV-10 Value are based on a December 31, 2008, Flint Hills West Texas Intermediate posted price of $41.25 per barrel, adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials and fixed price contracts for the life of each respective contract. Natural gas prices used in PV-10 Value are based on a December 31, 2008, Houston Ship Channel spot market price of $5.245 per mmBtu, adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees, and regional price differentials. Prices for hedges that are in place for a portion of our 2009 through 2011 projected sales were also used to adjust price expectations for those years. Oil and natural gas prices are held constant. While the methodology is the same across companies, the reference price and adjustments will vary between companies based on conditions in their production areas.
PV-10 Value is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. Therefore, we are including the disclosures required by Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to PV-10 Value. These disclosures include the following reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure ("standardized measure"), and discussion of how management uses the measure and why it is useful to investors.
We believe that the presentation of PV-10 Value is appropriate in our filings and relevant and useful to our investors because:
·
it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before corporate future income taxes, and
·
it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties.
Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. The PV-10 Value and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.

Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves that we can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. No reserve estimates have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign government authority or agency, other than the SEC, since our latest Form 10-K filing.
* Oil and natural gas were combined by converting oil to natural gas mcfe on the basis of 1 barrel of oil = 6 mcfe of gas.
Reserves declined 10.1 Bcfe, or 11.0%, from 91.8 Bcfe at year-end 2007. Annual production for 2008 was 9.2 Bcfe. Reserves sold during 2008 were 3.8 Bcfe. Net reserve additions for the year were 2.9 Bcfe in the face of downward revision in reserve estimates due to the decline in oil and natural gas prices in late 2008. This decline in prices was partially offset by commodity hedges in place on a portion of our oil and natural gas production.
SALES VOLUMES
The following table summarizes our net oil and natural gas production, average sales prices, and average production costs per unit of production for the periods indicated.
(1) Oil and natural gas were combined by converting oil to natural gas mcfe on the basis of 1 barrel of oil = 6 mcfe of natural gas.
(2) Production costs include direct lease operations and production taxes.
With respect to newly drilled wells, there can be no assurance that current production levels can be sustained. Depending upon reservoir characteristics, such levels of production could decline significantly.

PRODUCING PROPERTIES - WELLS AND ACREAGE
The following table sets forth our producing wells and developed acreage assignable to those wells for the last three fiscal years:
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells and wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Four of the above wells have active multiple completions.
A "gross well" or "gross acre" is a well or acre in which we hold a working interest. The number of gross wells or gross acres is the total number of wells or acres in which we own working interests. A "net well" or "net acre" is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership interest in gross wells or gross acres equals one. The number of net wells or net acres is the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE
As of December 31, 2008, we owned, by lease or in fee, the following undeveloped acres:
Ten Texas leases totaling approximately 373,555 gross acres contain varying requirements to drill a well every 90 to 180 days to keep undeveloped portions of the respective leases in effect. We presently drill in accordance with the terms of the leases and expect the leases to remain in force by virtue of production and continuous development during the year. However, due to our current liquidity problems, there can be no assurance that we can continue to hold leases by development.
DRILLING ACTIVITY
The following tables set forth our drilling activity for the last three years:
See the next page for the footnotes to this table.
- 21 -
(1) The 2008 column includes four oil wells and one natural gas well spud in prior years and completed in 2008, while the 2007 column includes two oil wells and two natural gas wells spud in prior years and completed in 2007, and the 2006 column includes three oil wells spud in prior years and completed in 2006.
(2) The dry holes in the 2006 column were wells spud in prior years.
(3) Total re-entries begun but not completed by year were: 2008 -- 10, 2007 -- 13, 2006 -- 3.
Activity: During 2008, we participated in 96 wells, including new drilling of 73 (52.88 net) wells and the re-entry of 23 (14.31 net) existing wells. We operated 57 (45.92 net) of the 73 newly drilled wells. Of the current-year drilling wells, 22 (13.61 net) remained in-progress at December 31, 2008. 12 of the re-entered wells were put on production in 2008, while the remaining re-entries were pending completion at December 31, 2008. During 2008, three (2.04 net) wells that were in progress at the beginning of the year were transferred to others by sale or exchange agreements. Additionally, we re-entered six beginning in-progress wells during 2008 that remain in completion phase.
At December 31, 2008, in-progress wells included 22 development wells spudded in 2008, four new developmental re-entries spudded in 2008, and 40 developmental wells that remained in progress from the beginning of 2008. Most of the in-progress wells are being scheduled for recompletion as horizontal wells or into other zones.
Activity: During 2007, we participated in 87 wells, including new drilling of 61 (46.81 net) wells and the re-entry of 26 (8.05 net) existing wells. We operated 43 (39.45 net) of the 61 newly drilled wells. Of the 87 wells begun in 2007, 35 (27.32 net) remained in progress at December 31, 2007. Twelve of the re-entered wells were placed on production as oil wells, one (0.02 net) was placed on production as a natural gas well and 13 (10.88 net) wells were in completion phase. Additionally, four (2.62) wells spudded during 2006 were completed and put on production in 2007.
At December 31, 2007, in-progress wells included 22 development wells spudded in 2007, 13 re-entries spudded in 2007, and 26 wells that remained in progress from the beginning of 2007.
Activity: We participated in 58 wells, including new drilling of 46 wells (41.47 net) and the re-entry of 12 (9.58 net) existing wells. We operated 36 (gross and net) of the newly drilled wells. Of the current-year drilling wells, 11 (9.50 net) remained in-progress at December 31, 2006. Six (5.45 net) of the re-entered wells were put on production as oil wells, one is being used as a water injection well, and two (1.13 net) are waiting to be plugged, while the remaining three (2.0 net) wells are in completion phase.
At December 31, 2006, in-progress wells included 11 development wells, two new developmental re-entries, and one new exploratory re-entry, all spudded in 2006, as well as 45 developmental wells that remained in progress from the beginning of 2006.
MAVERICK BASIN PLAYS
Eagle Ford Shales: The Eagle Ford is a promising, gas-prone shale resource play that underlies our entire 1 million gross acre Maverick Basin lease block. The formation underlies a large portion of South Texas, including the Maverick Basin. In addition to our partners, EnCana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. ("EnCana"), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and St. Mary Land & Exploration Company, several additional well-known companies, such as ConocoPhillips, Petrohawk and EOG, among others, have established acreage positions in the region and are now drilling or making preparations to initiate activities in this play.
- 22 -
During 2008, we entered into a farm-in agreement with Anadarko that called for the drilling of two Eagle Ford wells in Phase I. We completed Phase I in 2008 and have begun Phase II under this agreement, which calls for drilling additional wells during 2009. To date, delineation activities have included various horizontal drilling and completion innovations, progressing from uncemented, open-hole, single-stage fracture stimulations to our latest well, featuring a cemented liner completion with a 10-stage fracture stimulation test. In tests conducted in early 2009, this well flowed at rates as high as 6 mmcfed, including a high condensate content. Through February 2009, we have completed one of the wells required to earn the additional interests in the Phase II of this farm-in agreement. St. Mary Land & Exploration Company is also participating with us under this agreement.
Overall during 2008 we participated in four wells targeting the Eagle Ford formation. At year end, one of these wells was producing natural gas, one well was producing oil, one well was awaiting completion, and one well was drilling. Based on delineation results to date, both Anadarko and St. Mary have indicated their intent to accelerate drilling activities during 2009.
Pearsall Shale: This over-pressured resource natural gas shale play underlies approximately 819,000 gross acres of our Maverick Basin deep-rights holdings. We participated in the drilling, completion and testing of our first vertical Pearsall well under the EnCana agreement in the Maverick Basin during 2006, which began producing natural gas during January 2007. This data-gathering well was the first in a series targeting the natural gas resource play in a joint venture (50% WI) with EnCana as operator. To date, delineation activities have included vertical and horizontal drilling and various completion innovations, progressing from uncemented, open hole, single stage fracture stimulations to our latest well, featuring a cemented liner completion with a 9-stage fracture stimulation test.
We completed Phase I of our modified agreement with EnCana, carrying them on three wells by the end of July 2008, thus earning additional interests in the acreage block. Based on the success of the three initial wells, we elected to move to Phase II of the agreement, committing to drill four additional wells by the end of October 2009 to further increase our interest in the play, and through early March 2009, we have begun the first required well.
Overall during 2008, we participated in a total of six wells targeting the Pearsall formation. At year-end, two wells were producing natural gas, one well was waiting for pipeline connection, two wells were awaiting completion, and one well was completed as a monitor well. Based on delineation results to date, our partners, EnCana, Anadarko and St Mary have indicated their intent to accelerate drilling activities during 2009.
Glen Rose Oil: During 2008, our working interest in much of our non-operated, 95,250-gross acre Comanche Ranch lease was 75.5%. We have a proprietary 3-D seismic survey that covers the Comanche Ranch lease. We, along with our partners, acquired and processed the entire 3-D survey several years ago, identifying numerous Glen Rose prospects. While the first well found a water-bearing porosity, the second well became the discovery well for the Comanche Halsell (6500) field and tested at rates over 2,000 barrels of oil per day ("BOPD") in 2002. That well targeted a prospect on the Comanche Ranch lease, which contained evidence of multiple Glen Rose prospects stacked over a previously unidentified structure. Initial drilling found no productive reefs, but discovered a highly fractured porosity interval.
After the first three years of development, production on the Comanche Ranch lease was spread over a 20 square-mile area. Forty-degree gravity, low-sulfur oil is consistent throughout the entire area, which contains no gas. Our engineering staff completed extensive reviews of the porosity intervals and our oil and water production profiles and determined that this is a strong water-drive reservoir. Additionally, seismic was integrated with the Comanche Halsell field production profile. The water, which is produced along with the oil, is disposed of at surface locations or trucked to disposal wells.
Nine new wells and four re-entries were drilled on the Comanche Ranch lease during 2008 with our operating partner. Additionally, during 2008 we drilled or re-entered 17 Glen Rose oil wells on the adjacent Cage Ranch lease, where we hold a 100% WI. Of the combined 30 wells drilled or re-entered targeting the porosity zone, 23 were producing oil at year-end 2008, and seven were shut in pending further evaluation. For comparison, we drilled or re-entered 14 Glen Rose oil wells during 2007.
Glen Rose oil sales for 2008 totaled 813,600 barrels of oil ("BO") up from 714,200 BO during 2007. The combined number of wells drilled since the oil play's discovery in February 2002 stands at [117] through year-end 2008. Cumulative Glen Rose gross oil production since its discovery surpassed 6.1 million barrels of oil through January 2009. The project remains profitable and economics should improve as we better define the expansive play and perfect drilling techniques used to maximize the recovery of oil in this strong water-drive formation. Net proved reserves at December 31, 2008, for the Glen Rose oil porosity zone are estimated at 1.4 million BO, equivalent to 8.4 Bcfe, compared with 1.6 million (9.9 Bcfe) for the prior year. We believe that significant additional proved reserves will be established in the future.
During 2007, we contracted with Schlumberger to conduct a comprehensive reservoir optimization study that focused on multiple aspects of the GRP project, including the establishment of higher reserve levels, higher recovery rates, evaluating secondary recovery opportunities and overall operating efficiencies. Their report was delivered in 2008 and our technical staff modified certain of its procedures based on the study.

Georgetown: During 2008, we spudded six new Georgetown wells and re-entered six wells, as compared to three Georgetown wells drilled or re-entered in 2007. Of the 12 Georgetown wells started in 2008, six wells are producing oil and one well is producing gas, while four wells remain in completion and one well was dry. Georgetown natural gas sales for 2008 totaled 75.3 mmcf, compared to 38.4 mmcf during 2007, while Georgetown oil sales increased to 73,800 BO from 14,300 BO in 2007. Based on this ongoing success, we have participated in three Georgetown wells through February 2009. In order to conserve capital, we entered into a joint venture with Millenium E&P Resource Fund I, LLC ("Millenium") on December 31, 2008, whereby we are carried for a 50% interest at no cost to us.
We began using seismic coherency processing to more accurately predict the location of formation faults and fractures in this field in late 2003. The Georgetown is a fractured reservoir, which makes it difficult to predict the type and quantity of ultimate reserves for each well, as such reservoirs typically have hyperbolic decline curves with high initial production rates that rapidly fall to lower, sustained rates. Georgetown proved reserve estimates increased to 1.9 Bcfe from 0.7 Bcfe at year-end 2007.
San Miguel Waterflood: In 2002, we acquired the Pena Creek oil field in Dimmit County, Texas, which included 94 producing oil wells, 94 injection wells and 28 shut-in wells. We completed a 3-D seismic survey covering the field and surrounding acreage. We also completed an extensive geological, engineering and 3-D seismic review, including the review of historic well data acquired with the property. These evaluations enabled us to identify bypassed infill San Miguel oil reserves, establishing more than 120 potential infill locations to date, with further potential to establish additional infill locations as warranted by ongoing drilling results. We expect additional oil recovery from planned revamping of injection well configuration.
During 2008, we began 11 infill wells targeting bypassed reserves and three wells not in the waterflood zone. All of these 14 wells are producing oil at December 31, 2008. During 2007, we drilled 11 wells. San Miguel oil sales in 2008 were 77,800 BO, compared to 78,700 BO in 2007. Net proved reserves at year-end for this field were estimated at 3.4 million barrels, equivalent to 20.6 Bcfe, down slightly from 3.9 million barrels (23.2 Bcfe) at year-end 2007. The 10,000-gross acre Pena Creek prospect is contiguous to our Comanche Ranch lease.
Glen Rose Gas: In late 2001, we announced the start of a horizontal Glen Rose shoal natural gas play on a portion of our Chittim and Paloma leases. Our geologists analyzed a large carbonate shoal (or carbonate "sand" bar) located within the Glen Rose interval. The Chittim 1-141, the first well completed in this program, went on production in 2001. Pursuant to our agreement with AROC-Texas Inc., covering this portion of the Chittim lease, we drill and complete these horizontal Glen Rose shoal wells and AROC operates them. Since 2001, we have completed 32 horizontal Glen Rose natural gas wells, with one well awaiting completion.
We did not participate in Glen Rose shoal or reef wells during 2008, compared to six wells in 2007. One of the 2007 reef wells was later recompleted to the Georgetown formation. Glen Rose natural gas sales for 2008 totaled 0.7 Bcf, compared to 0.8 Bcf during 2007. The field has produced more than 16.5 Bcfe since horizontal drilling techniques were first applied in 2001. At December 31, 2008, net proved natural gas reserves for Glen Rose were estimated at 5.0 Bcfe, compared to 7.0 Bcfe for the prior year.
Oil Sands: The San Miguel Oil Sands feature ("Oil Sands") is prospective under approximately 83,500 gross acres of our existing Maverick Basin acreage. Independent reservoir engineers and geologists have estimated that there are 7 to 10 billion BO in place basin wide. We have conducted three pilot projects that have provided important information that could prove valuable when favorable crude oil prices allow commercial-scale production at some future date. Also, Conoco and Mobil did pilot projects on the San Miguel Oil Sands in the late 1970's and early 1980's and achieved recoveries of over 50% with the use of steam injection. The Oil Sands are similar to those found in Cold Lake Field in Canada. In 2005 we entered into a Participation Agreement that has resulted in a shared leasehold working interest with Newmex Energy (USA) Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pearl Exploration and Production, Ltd. (TSX Venture: "PXX") ("Pearl"). While we are the operator with a 50% WI, we are drawing on Pearl's technical expertise with similar projects in Canada. The Participation Agreement includes an Area of Mutual Interest that contains approximately 42,500 gross acres of our joint leasehold and calls for the drilling of three pilot wells at no cost to us. In addition, we hold a 100% WI in approximately 41,000 contiguous acres over the deposit.
To date, we have completed our initial, two-well cyclic steam pilot phase, having mobilized the oil and established a preliminary, favorable WTI price differential from area refiners. Based on continuing reservoir simulation studies, we decided to convert this pilot to a Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage ("SAGD") process by the addition of two horizontal wells. We used our recently purchased shallow drilling rig to drill two horizontal wells in this conversion. The SAGD technique is used extensively in Canada. This marks the first time that a SAGD pilot has been applied to the San Miguel oil sands.
- 24 -
The SAGD well pair was drilled between the existing cyclic steam wells, which were converted to temperature-monitoring wells. Existing steam generation capacity was doubled in 2008 by the addition of a second 25 mmBtu steam generator. The SAGD project continued steam injection and initial oil production began during fourth-quarter 2008. We discontinued the SAGD project in February 2009, after obtaining valuable information to document the recovery rates and costs associated with harvesting the heavy oil for future use.
We also further utilized our new drilling rig to establish a second pilot during the first half of 2008, featuring five to eight new horizontal/vertical wells utilizing a modified Fracture-Assisted Steamflood Technology (FAST), a technique proven by Conoco in years past. Two new 50 mmBtu steam generators were installed in second-quarter 2008.
Due to the sharp decline in crude oil prices, we shut-in the FAST project in December 2008 until the outlook for oil prices improves, and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $11 million for this project.
Other Plays: During 2008, we drilled three wells to the Austin Chalk formation, two of which are producing oil, while one was awaiting completion at December 31, 2008. Three wells were also spud to the Austin Chalk formation during 2007.
OTHER AREAS
Former Output Properties: As described in the "Recent Developments" section of this Item, on April 2, 2007, we closed on the purchase of Output Exploration LLC. The core of the Output assets is in the East Texas Fort Trinidad Field and is prospective for the Glen Rose, Buda, Austin Chalk, Eagle Ford/Woodbine and Bossier formations. Other Output assets acquired include acreage in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions and shallow Gulf of Mexico waters. Certain of these assets were sold during 2008.
TXCO participated in a total of nine new wells and two re-entries on former Output assets during 2008. Of the 11 total wells that we participated in three were in Oklahoma, five were in Texas and three were in shallow waters off the Louisiana coast. At December 31, 2008, three of these wells were producing, seven awaited completion and one awaits plugging. Additionally, six wells that were in progress at December 31, 2007, were completed during 2008 with five producing natural gas and one producing oil. In 2007, we participated in a total of 12 wells on former Output assets. Our 2008 net sales for former Output properties totaled 132,000 BO and 1.4 bcf, as compared to 143,600 BO and 1.2 bcf in 2007.
Marfa Basin: The Marfa Basin is located approximately 200 miles northwest of our Maverick Basin leases. It is an underexplored area along the Ouachita Overthrust that is prospective for the Barnett and Woodford Shales. We acquired an interest in 140,000 gross acres in the Marfa Basin in 2005, and in 2006 brought in Continental Resources Inc. as our 50% partner. We re-entered one vertical well targeting the Woodford shale during 2006, which tested gas. A fracture stimulation procedure was performed on the well during 2007 and certain zones were perforated in the wellbore during 2008.
Williston Basin: At December 31, 2008, we retained approximately 4,400 gross and 2,000 net acres in the Williston Basin. During 2008, we participated in the drilling of one new well (2.77% WI) in the Red River formation, which is producing oil. In 2007 we participated in one new and two re-entered oil wells in this formation. Our 2008 net sales for the Williston Basin totaled 19,900 BO and 18.3 mmcf, as compared to 19,600 BO and 26.6 mmcf in 2007.
GAS GATHERING SYSTEM
We acquired a gathering system in 2002 to enhance our infrastructure in the Maverick Basin, which we expanded over the intervening years. At December 31, 2008, the system consisted of over 90 miles of natural gas pipeline, a compressor station with three compressors and three dehydrators that allowed a deliverable capacity of 35 mmcfd, of which one-third was utilized. The pipeline begins approximately 12 miles north of Eagle Pass, Texas, in Maverick County, and runs to Carrizo Springs, Texas, in Dimmit County, where it terminates. The natural gas can be routed to five separate delivery points and either processed or sold at multiple markets. No significant additions were made to the gathering system since 2004.
This natural gas gathering system transports our production to various markets. It also transports production for other owners at a set rate per mmBtu. It sells natural gas at several points along the system with a significant portion being delivered to purchasers through the Enterprise/Gulf Terra Pipeline System, to purchasers behind the Duke Three Rivers processing plant, or to a local distribution customer in Piedras Negras, Mexico. The natural gas is processed and the natural gas liquids are removed. The residue gas is then sold to various purchasers. We receive a share of the liquids revenues. Natural gas pricing fluctuations are reflected at the wellhead for our operated natural gas properties. The following table summarizes our natural gas marketing sales volumes and average sales prices per mmBtu for the periods indicated. There can be no assurance that current access levels to third party pipelines and processing facilities can be sustained.
- 25 -
In order to enhance our liquidity, we sold all interests in the pipeline system effective February 1, 2009, to Clear Springs Energy Company LLC, a Texas limited liability company. We expect to continue to utilize this pipeline system to transport much of our natural gas production.
ITEM 3.
