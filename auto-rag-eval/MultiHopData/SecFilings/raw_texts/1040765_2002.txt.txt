RETAIL SEGMENT
The Company owns 62 retail properties of which 51 are strip shopping centers primarily located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, two are regional malls located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two are super-regional malls located in Nassau County, Long Island, New York and in Monmouth County, New Jersey and seven are retail sites located in Manhattan. The Company's strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major regional highways in mature, densely populated areas. The Company believes these properties attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place because of their location on regional highways.
The Company's strip shopping centers which contain an aggregate of 9.3 million square feet, are substantially (over 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores, membership warehouse clubs and "category killers." Category killers are large stores which offer a complete selection of a category of items (e.g., toys, office supplies, etc.) at low prices, often in a warehouse format. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price.
The Company's two regional malls are the Montehiedra Mall which contains 554,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart and Marshalls and the Las Catalinas Mall which contains 354,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears, which owns its store. On September 23, 2002, the Company increased its interest in the Las Catalinas Mall to 100% by acquiring the 50% of the mall and the 25% of Kmart's anchor store it did not already own.
The Green Acres Mall is a 1.6 million square foot super-regional mall located in Long Island, New York. The Green Acres Mall is anchored by four major department stores: three of which, Sears, Roebuck and Co., J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Federated Department Stores, Inc. ("Federated") doing business as Macy's, are operating and the fourth, also leased to Federated (previously occupied by Stern's), is currently dark, however, Federated continues to pay the rent. The complex also includes The Plaza at Green Acres, a 188,000 square foot strip shopping center which is anchored by National Wholesale Liquidators. The Company has entered into a lease with Wal-Mart for the other anchor store at the Plaza, which is subject to governmental approvals.
The Monmouth Mall, located in Eatontown, New Jersey was acquired on October 10, 2002, by a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest. The mall is a super regional mall containing 1.5 million square feet and anchored by four department store tenants (Macy's, Lord & Taylor, J.C. Penney's and Boscovs), three of which own 731,000 square feet of the 1.5 million square feet.
The following table sets forth the percentage of the Retail Portfolio 2002 rentals by type of retailer:
The Manhattan retail sites include six operating properties containing 127,000 square feet, including 43,000 square feet of new retail space at 435 Seventh Avenue leased to Hennes & Mauritz. The seventh property, 4 Union Square South, is currently under development.
The following tables set forth the occupancy rate and the average annual base rent per square foot for the retail properties at the end of each of the past five years.
STRIP SHOPPING CENTERS:
REGIONAL AND SUPER REGIONAL MALLS:
The aggregate occupancy rate for the 12.5 million square feet of retail properties at December 31, 2002 is 88.3%. The occupancy rate includes leases for 490,000 square feet at five locations (4%) which have not commenced at December 31, 2002. Three of these locations aggregating 268,000 square feet are ground leased to Lowe's which plans to demolish the existing buildings and construct its own stores at the sites and two locations containing 223,000 square feet are leased to Wal-Mart, which plans to demolish an existing building and construct its own store at one of the sites and occupy the existing store at the other site. All of these redevelopment projects are subject to governmental approvals and in some cases, the relocation of existing tenants.
The Company's shopping center lease terms range from 5 years or less in some instances for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenants' sales and pass through to tenants of the tenants' share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant's direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 1% of total shopping center revenues in 2002. None of the tenants in the Retail Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenues.
Below is a listing of tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Retail property revenues in 2002:
FORMER BRADLEES LOCATIONS:
The Company previously leased 18 locations to Bradlees which closed all of its stores in February 2001. The leases for four former Bradlees locations were assigned by Bradlees to other retailers. The Company has re-leased nine of the other former Bradlees locations; three to Kohl's, two each to Lowe's and Haynes Furniture, and one each to Home Depot and Wal-Mart. Lowe's and Wal-Mart will demolish the existing properties and construct their own stores, subject to the receipt of various governmental approvals and the relocation of existing tenants. Of the remaining five locations which are currently vacant, two of the leases are guaranteed and the rent is being paid by Stop & Shop, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koninklijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), an international food retailer. Stop & Shop remains contingently liable for rent at a number of the former Bradlees locations for the term of the Bradlees leases.
Property rentals for the year ended December 31, 2002, include $5,000,000 of additional rent which, effective December 31, 2002, was re-allocated to the former Bradlees locations in Marlton, Turnersville, Bensalem and Broomall and is payable by Stop & Shop, pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992. This amount is in addition to all other rent guaranteed at the former Bradlees locations. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. The additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012. The Company intends to vigorously contest Stop & Shop's position.
In February 2003, Koninklijke Ahold NV, parent of Stop & Shop, announced that it overstated its 2002 and 2001 earnings by at least $500 million and is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, this situation may have on Stop & Shop's ability to satisfy its obligation under the Bradlees guarantees and rent for existing Stop & Shop leases aggregating approximately $10.5 million per annum.

Since its formation, the joint venture has acquired equity interests in 91 partnerships which own approximately 19.6 million square feet of real estate and first and second mortgages secured by a portion of these properties. The Company owned a 30% interest in the joint venture with the balance owned by Apollo. On January 1, 2002, the Newkirk partnerships were merged into The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership (the "MLP") to create a vehicle to enable the partners to have greater access to capital and future investment opportunities.
