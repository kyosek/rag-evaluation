Types of Real Estate Investments. The Trust's real estate consists of commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and a shopping center) and apartments or similar properties having established income- producing capabilities. In selecting new real estate investments, the location, age and type of property, gross rentals, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Trust may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Board of Trustees may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of shareholders to the extent such policies are not governed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust.
Although the Trust has typically invested in developed real estate, the Trust may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Board of Trustees). To the extent that the Trust invests in construction and development projects, the Trust would be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.
At December 31, 1998, the Trust was making significant capital improvements to two office buildings in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Trust expects to spend a total of $2.2 million on the 225 Baronne Office Building and $3.0 million on the 1010 Common Office Building in 1999.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by the Trust are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of the Trust's real estate (other than land as described below) at December 31, 1998.

Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of the Trust's assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally secured by income-producing real estate. The Trust expects that the percentage of its assets invested in mortgage loans will continue to decrease, as it is not actively seeking to fund or acquire mortgage loans. It may, however, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. The Trust intends to service and may either hold for investment or sell any or all of the mortgage notes in its portfolio. The Trust's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. The Trust has originated its own mortgage loans as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms,
commercial banks or other qualified brokers. The Trust is generally not considering new mortgage lending, except in special circumstances or in connection with purchase money financing offered to facilitate the sale of a property. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Trust's mortgage notes. The Trust's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS--Business Plan and Investment Policy".
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The properties securing the mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1998, consisted of office buildings, a mobile home park and a building housing a health club. To the extent that the Declaration of Trust does not control such matters, the Board of Trustees may alter the types of properties subject to mortgage loans in which the Trust invests without a vote of the shareholders. In addition to restricting the types of collateral and priority of mortgage loans in which the Trust may invest, the Declaration of Trust imposes certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
At December 31, 1998, the mortgage notes receivable portfolio consisted of four mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3.5 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest. At December 31, 1998, approximately 1% of the Trust's assets were invested in mortgage notes receivable.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note receivable balance), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1998. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1998 is as follows:
First Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in first mortgage loans, with either short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the Trust's policy is to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Trust may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Trust.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1998 and to date.
In April 1998, the Trust sold five mortgage notes secured by single-family residences in Arizona and Hawaii for $319,000, receiving net cash of $304,000 after the payment of various closing costs. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale.
In June 1998, the Trust collected in full a mortgage note with a principal balance of $304,000.
In December 1998, the Trust collected in full a mortgage note with a principal balance of $547,000.
At December 31, 1998, a matured mortgage note with a principal balance of $700,000 was in default. Until July 1998, the Trust had been receiving partial interest payments monthly. In December 1998, the Trust wrote off the note after it determined that it was uncollectible. No loss was incurred in excess of the reserve previously established.
As discussed above in "Real Estate," seven of the Company's mortgage notes with a combined principal balance, at December 31, 1997, of $1.4 million were pledged as additional collateral on a $2.3 million loan, primarily secured by the AMOCO Office Building. In March 1998, the AMOCO mortgage was refinanced and the collateral loans were released.
In February 1999, the Trust sold, to the underlying lienholder, its mortgage note receivable secured by the Cypress Creek Office Building in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, for $1.6 million, receiving net cash of $111,000 after paying off $1.4 million in mortgage debt and the payment of various closing costs. The purchaser has no recourse to the Trust if the note should not be collected in full. A gain will be recognized on the sale.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage loan having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan(s) plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Trust's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties that it would otherwise make first mortgage loans. At December 31, 1998, the mortgage notes receivable portfolio contained one wraparound mortgage loan.
As discussed above in "Real Estate," the Trust provided $467,000 of seller financing in the form of a wraparound note in conjunction with the sale of the Pinemont Professional Building. The note bears interest at 10.4% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $6,281 and matures in July 2008.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower. The Declaration of Trust restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Trust's assets. At December 31, 1998, less than 1% of the Trust's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 1998 and to date.
In February 1996, the Trust funded a $1.5 million second lien mortgage secured by the Signature Athletic Club in Dallas, Texas. The note matured in October 1998. The Trust had also guaranteed the underlying first lien mortgage secured by the property, which also matured in October 1998. The Trust ceased recognizing interest income on the note in June 1996. In February 1999, the Trust obtained ownership of the partnership that owns the property. The partnership refinanced the property in the amount of $2.7 million, receiving no net cash after paying off the matured $2.6 million first lien and the payment of various closing costs. The mortgage bears interest at 8.5% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $23,000 and matures in February 2004. The Trust incurred no loss as the fair value of the property exceeded the carrying value of the Trust's note receivable and assumed first lien mortgage.
Equity Investments in Real Estate Entities
In September 1990, the Board of Trustees authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 million of the common stock of ART through negotiated or open market transactions. The officers of the Trust also serve as officers of ART. BCM, the Trust's advisor, also serves as advisor to ART. At March 5, 1999, ART owned approximately 41.1% of the Trust's outstanding shares of beneficial interest. At December 31, 1998, the Trust owned 820,850 shares of ART's common stock, approximately 7.6% of the shares outstanding, which the Trust primarily purchased in open market transactions in 1990 and 1991, at a total cost of $1.6 million.
