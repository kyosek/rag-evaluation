Item 2. Properties.
Monterey Park Building (formerly American Color Building and GE Medical Systems Office Building)
On July 10, 1986, Registrant acquired the Monterey Park Building, located in Monterey Park, California, for approximately $4,182,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Monterey Park Building and its 90,000 square feet of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan (See Item 1. - "Business-Fleet Bank Loan"). The property was built in 1985 and contains 22,250 net rentable square feet (increased from 20,250 square feet for previous tenancies). The property had been a unique combination of office space (approximately 71%) and warehouse space, but the building has been reconfigured solely for use as office, design and development space for use pursuant to a net lease for the entire premises.
The building is 100% leased to LightCross, Inc. pursuant to a lease dated as of November 17, 2000. The initial term of the lease is ten (10) years from September 1, 2001, subject to two five-year renewal options.
The lease requires approximate annual net rent of $433,915 for the first two years ($19.50 per square foot), increasing to $446,197 in the third and fourth years ($20.05 per square foot), $458,970 in the fifth and sixth years ($20.63 per square foot), $472,254 in the seventh and eighth years ($21.22 per
square foot), and $486,070 in the ninth and tenth years ($21.85 per square foot). The lease shall require payment of a fair market rental during any renewal periods. This lease is a net lease and, except for certain structural and mechanical conditions, the tenant is responsible for all costs, expenses, and obligations relating to the premises and the use, operation, occupancy, management, maintenance, and repair of the building, including insurance and real estate taxes. LightCross is expected to be a large user of electricity. Electric rates in this area have risen greatly, the effect of which could adversely affect LightCross's financial condition.
During 2001, Registrant expended approximately $1,533,000 in capital improvements and tenant improvements in connection with this lease. The improvements include enclosing the rear loading bays, converting warehouse space to office space, building a new entrance area, improving distribution of electricity, and contributing to the tenant's construction of a dust-free "clean room." In addition, the tenant expended approximately $800,000 to make further improvements to the premises.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $37,000 in real property taxes with respect to the Monterey Park Building. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at a rate of 1.2522% on an assessed value of $3,100,000.
The tenant has been granted a right of first offer to purchase the Monterey Park Building on the same terms and conditions on which Registrant may be willing to sell the building to a third party.
The Monterey Park area includes approximately 2,135,000 square feet of office space. The vacancy rate for commercial properties in such area approximates 4.4% for office buildings. Net rents (like the LightCross lease) for office space approximate $15.60 to $16.20 per square foot and gross rents approximate $19.80 to $24.60 per square foot in this area. Registrant obtained rents from LightCross in excess of those otherwise available in the Monterey Park area in consideration of agreeing to pay for construction of the "clean room" at an approximate cost of $800,000.
The Directory Building (formerly, the IBM Building)
On October 27, 1986, Registrant acquired the Directory Building, located in Las Colinas, Texas, for a purchase price of approximately $24,580,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Directory Building and its 6.67 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The Directory Building was built in 1982 and contains approximately 152,100 net rentable square feet (reduced from 154,300 square feet during IBM's tenancy).
The building is 100% leased to GTE pursuant to a lease dated as of April 20, 1994, as subsequently amended by amendments dated as of July 29, 1994 and as of February 22, 1995 and as extended by an Extension Agreement and Supplement dated as of March 31, 2000. The renewed initial term of the lease expires on September 30, 2003, subject to two (2) five-year renewal options at a rate equal to the then market rate.
The renewed lease requires approximate monthly rent of $259,873 through September 30, 2003 ($20.50 per square foot). GTE must also pay additional rent equal to excess electric charges and operating expenses over base levels. Registrant has agreed to cap most operating expenses at cumulative increases of five percent (5%) per annum for purposes of this lease.
Registrant incurred approximately $66,000 in capital expenditures at the building during 2001. Registrant has expended an aggregate of approximately $3,348,000 in capital expenditures and tenant improvements at the building.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $437,000 in real property taxes with respect to the Directory Building. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at an aggregate rate of 2.727725% on an assessed value of $16,025,940.
The Las Colinas office market includes approximately 18,365,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 13,105,000 square feet constitute Class "A" office space and 6,190,000 square feet constitute Class "B" office space. As of November 2001, approximately 75.3% of office space (80.2% of Class "A" office space and 69.6% of Class "B" office space) was leased. Average asking rents were approximately $22.01 per square foot for available Class "A" space and $18.04 for available Class "B" space. The Directory Building is considered to be Class "B+" space.
Tumi Building (formerly Austin Place Building)
On December 30, 1986, Registrant acquired the Tumi Building, a two-wing office building located in South Plainfield, New Jersey, for a purchase price of approximately $16,473,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Tumi Building and its underlying five acres of land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property was built in 1986 and contains approximately 107,900 net rentable square feet for use as a multi-tenant facility (reduced from 108,000 square feet as a single tenant facility, but subsequently increased from 106,600 square feet due to tenant expansion into common areas).
As of March 15, 2002, the property is approximately 75.7% leased, with 45,700 square feet leased to Tumi, Inc. (as discussed below) and the remainder at an average current rent of approximately $18.15 per square foot. Such other leases expire in October and November 2005 (approximately 17,400 square feet) and June 2006 (approximately 18,600 square feet).
Tumi's lease is for 45,700 square feet and expires on January 19, 2009. It requires rent payments equal to $16.00 per square foot until January 2006 and $17.00 per square foot from February 2006 to January 2009. The lease includes two 5-year renewal terms, the first at a base rent of $20.00 per square foot and the second at a then fair market rental. Tumi is also obligated to pay for its electric current consumption and its proportionate share (42.3%) of increases in operating expenses, taxes, and insurance over base year 1999 levels.
Registrant has also entered into a five year lease with AT&T Wireless PCS, LLC to permit installation and operation of a cellular telephone tower on the roof of the Tumi Building. The lease provides for annual rental payments of $19,800, five automatic five-year renewal periods and a three percent (3%) increase in rental payments at the commencement of each renewal period.
On March 9, 1999, Gdynia America Line, Inc., a tenant occupying approximately 21,650 square feet (20.3%) in the Tumi Building filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Polish Ocean Lines, a Polish corporation partially owned by the Polish Government, is jointly and severally obligated under this lease. On or about April 30, 1999, the lease, with a term expiring in May 2007 and annual rental payments of approximately $446,000, was rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding. In July 2000, Registrant obtained a judgment in an action in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division; Middlesex County against Polish Ocean Lines in the approximate amount of $618,600. On May 4, 2001, the amount of this judgment was increased to approximately $4,389,400. Registrant is pursuing enforcement of its judgment in Poland, but there can be no assurance as to its ability to collect any of the judgment against Polish Ocean Lines. This space in the Tumi Building remains vacant.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $226,000 in real property taxes with respect to the Tumi Building. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at a rate of 1.81% on an assessed value of $6,500,000.
South Plainfield is located in Middlesex County (approximately 17,058,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 13,128,000 is Class A and 3,385,000 is Class B). Vacancies in Middlesex County approximate 17.3%, including 19.1% in Class A space and 10.3% in Class B space. Average asking rents for office space in the Middlesex County approximate $24.31 per square foot, including $25.47 for Class A space and $19.21 for Class B space. Registrant has expended approximately $3,110,000 for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, all of which were incurred prior to 2001.
Marathon Oil Building (formerly, the Tenneco Building)
On March 21, 1988, Registrant acquired the Marathon Oil Building (formerly the Tenneco Building), an office building located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for approximately $10,736,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Marathon Oil Building with its 6.1 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property contains approximately 90,925 net rentable square feet on two floors, plus a 10,016 square foot basement.
Marathon Oil Company leases approximately 65,700 square feet (including approximately 4,300 in the basement) in the building. Marathon renewed its lease to extend the term from February 2001 for an additional five-year term that expires in February 2006. The lease is subject to an additional renewal option for another five-year term. Marathon's lease also was amended in February 2001 to expand its space by approximately 700 square feet.
Annual rent under Marathon's lease is approximately $716,488 ($11.25 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space), increasing to approximately $793,201 ($12.50 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space) in the third year and $869,915 ($13.75 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space) in the fourth and fifth years. Marathon must also pay additional rent equal to its proportionate share of any increases in operating costs of the building after 1996.
Registrant has leased approximately an additional 9,340 square feet in the building (plus 340 square feet of basement space) at an average current rent of approximately $13.50 per square foot (plus $5.00 per square foot for basement space). These leases expire in December 2004 (approximately 5,640 square feet plus 340 square feet of basement) and May 2006 (approximately 3,700 square feet). The remaining space (approximately 24.7% of the space) is vacant and Registrant is seeking tenants for such space.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $57,000 in real property taxes with respect to the Marathon Oil Building. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at a rate of 1.1% on an assessed value of $5,218,680.
Market conditions in the northwest section of Oklahoma City featured reduced demand and rental rates attributable to a weakening economy and the addition of Class A office space. Such market contains approximately 5,058,000 square feet of commercial space of which approximately 15.2% is vacant. Average rents for commercial space range from $8.50 to $18.50 per square foot, with an average rate of $14.31 per square foot. Registrant has expended approximately $519,250 on capital and tenant improvements at this building, $78,000 of which was spent in 2001.
475 Fifth Avenue
On December 6, 1996, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as 475 Fifth Avenue, and situated in New York, New York, for approximately $27,440,000 including capitalized costs and related costs. The property contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 241,000 square feet and is located on the southeast corner of 41st Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City; the Subsidiary Partnership owns fee title to 475 Fifth Avenue, subject to the lien of the 475 Loan.
475 Fifth Avenue is a 23-story office building with approximately 20,000 square feet of retail space on the first floor and basement, 216,300 square feet of office space, and 5,100 square feet of basement storage space. As of March 15, 2002, approximately 78.4% of the rentable square footage of office and retail space in the building was leased (including approximately 84.3% of the office space and 14.7% of the retail space), at an average current rent (base rent plus electric charges and prior year adjustments) of approximately $36.51 per square foot (approximately $34.86 per square foot of office space and $138.14 per square foot of retail space). Following is a schedule of the expirations of such leases.
During 2001, two retail tenants occupying an aggregate of approximately 16,740 square feet (plus 1,900 square feet of storage space) and paying aggregate annual rents of approximately $1,000,000 vacated 475 Fifth Avenue. One of such tenants (paying approximately $240,000 in annual rent) had its lease rejected in bankruptcy proceedings and paid rent through December 2001. The other retail tenant (paying $750,000 in annual rent) ceased paying rent after September 2001 and vacated the building in December 2001 upon forfeiture of a security deposit in the approximate amount of $91,670.
During 2001, Registrant also experienced vacancies aggregating approximately 29,950 square feet (with aggregate annual rents of approximately $1,200,000) at 475 Fifth Avenue. One of such leases (for 14,470 square feet and annual rents of approximately $607,000) was terminated early in exchange for a fee in the approximate amount of $720,000.
Registrant's leases generally provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of a porter's wage and real estate tax escalation factors; Registrant may increase the electricity charge if a review demonstrates that Registrant's cost of obtaining such electricity exceeds the charge imposed on tenants. Certain tenants (leasing approximately 20% to 25% of the space in the building) have leases that provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of operating expense and real estate tax escalation factors.
In 1997, Registrant commenced a capital improvement program, designed to increase rental rates and the value of the building. In connection with obtaining the 475 Loan, a capital reserve schedule was prepared for 475 Fifth Avenue, detailing improvements aggregating approximately $1,840,000 over a 12-year period. Registrant has completed the following improvements at 475 Fifth Avenue: roof replacement and masonry restoration above the 19th floor; elevator modernization, including mechanical cables and security system; drain and drain line replacement; installation of a new electrical panel on one side of the building; continuing installation of hot water heating and sprinkler systems and upgrading of electric service and closets on floors as vacancies occur; lobby and entrance renovation; renovating restrooms to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") requirements on floors as vacancies occur; construction and enclosing of basement staircases to conform with building code requirements; and demolition of vacant retail space to prepare it for marketing. Registrant intends to make the following additional improvements: masonry restoration on the lower floors of the building; continuation of hot water heating and sprinkler system installation, upgrading of electric service and closets, and renovating restrooms to comply with ADA on floors as vacancies occur; installing the main sprinkler distribution system; installation of a new electrical panel on the other side of the building; completion of elevator interior redecoration; and continuing window replacement. Registrant estimates that such additional improvements, planned to be made over the next several years, will cost approximately $1,900,000. In 2001, Registrant expended capital improvements and tenant improvements aggregating approximately $1,783,000 at 475 Fifth Avenue. Certain capital improvements can only be made as tenancies expire. Capital improvements and tenant improvements have been, and are expected in the future to be, funded from working capital, the repair reserve under the 475 Loan, and from increases in rental income, if any.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $1,293,000 in real property taxes with respect to 475 Fifth Avenue. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at a rate of 9.768% on an assessed value of $13,503,000.
475 Fifth Avenue is situated in the Grand Central district of the New York City midtown market. Such district includes approximately 51,920,000 aggregate rentable square feet (vacancy rate of approximately 8.7%), of which approximately 45,460,000 are Class A buildings (8.9% vacancy rate) and 6,460,000 are Class B buildings (6.9% vacancy rate). Asking rents in this district average approximately $50.44 per square foot ($51.88 for Class A buildings and $40.47 for Class B buildings). The entire midtown market includes approximately 250,496,000 aggregate rentable square feet (194,356,000 in Class A buildings and 56,140,000 in Class B buildings), an approximate 6.1% vacancy rate (5.5% for Class A buildings and 8.0% for Class B buildings), and average asking rents of approximately $51.13 per square foot ($54.94 for Class A buildings and $37.70 for Class B buildings).
Alamo Towers
On March 17, 1997, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as the Alamo Towers, and situated in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $12,002,000, including capitalized closing and related costs. The Alamo Towers contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 193,000 square feet (reduced from approximately
196,000 square feet when Registrant acquired the property). Registrant owns fee title to the Alamo Towers, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan.
The Alamo Towers is an office building consisting of two stand-alone 8-story towers with approximately 184,600 square feet of office space and 8,300 square feet of basement space. As of March 1, 2002, approximately 83.2% of the rentable square footage of office space in the Alamo Towers was leased, at an average current rent (base rent plus escalation adjustments) of approximately $15.03 per square foot. Following is a schedule of expiration of such leases.
=============================================================================== Approximate Avg. Current Expiration Year Square Feet % of Total Rent/Sq.Ft. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2002 33,580 18.2% $15.79 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 17,124 9.3% $15.91 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2004 32,151 17.5% $15.56 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005 16,701 9.1% $14.99 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006 45,806 24.9% $13.78 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2007 7,766 4.2% $15.05 ===============================================================================
The Alamo Towers has yet to achieve sustainable increases in occupancy rates, primarily because of the absence of a covered parking garage. Registrant's planned significant capital improvements for this building, delayed in large part because of the capital improvements made at 475 Fifth Avenue, began implementation in earnest in 2001. Registrant completed renovation of the lobby in the West Tower and added granite to the entrances and stairs in both towers. In 2001, Registrant completed payment for the relocation of the building's mechanical plant and replacement of all heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment. Registrant also upgraded the fire alarm panels in both towers and is continuing to separate the heating and air conditioning systems in tenant spaces (to better regulate the temperature) as vacancies occur. In 2001, Registrant also upgraded the parking lot surface and lighting.
Registrant plans to construct a covered parking garage in 2002, depending upon the availability of funds. Registrant likely will need to sell one of its properties to finance this construction. The planned garage has been scaled back to a 550 car garage at an estimated cost of $3,250,000 (as contrasted to a 1,000 car garage at a cost of $6,000,000). The garage construction is tentatively scheduled to commence in the summer of 2002 and is expected to take six to eight months to complete. In the future, Registrant may need to replace the roof (estimated at $400,000), recaulk the glass walls and windows (estimated at $200,000), install sprinklers on all floors (estimated at $250,000), and upgrade restrooms to comply with ADA (estimated at $500,000 to $600,000), but these improvements are unlikely to occur in the near future. In 2001, Registrant expended approximately $2,158,000 in tenant improvements and capital improvements to the Alamo Towers.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Registrant paid approximately $300,000 (with a discount) in real property taxes with respect to the Alamo Towers. At December 31, 2001, such taxes were imposed at a rate of 3.015365% on an assessed value of $10,000,000.
The San Antonio office market includes approximately 21,990,000 aggregate rentable square feet (including approximately 7,410,000 square feet of Class A space and 10,770,000 square feet of
Class B space), of which approximately 14.1% is currently vacant (8.7% of Class A space and 15.2% of Class B space). Asking rents in this market now average $17.86 per square foot ($21.10 for Class A space and $16.69 for Class B space). The north-central San Antonio market includes approximately 8,030,000 aggregate rentable square feet (including approximately 3,140,000 square feet of Class A space and 4,420,000 square feet of Class B space), of which approximately 12.6% is vacant (10.3% of Class A space and 12.9% of Class B space) and for which asking rents average approximately $18.46 per square foot ($20.75 for Class A space and $17.36 for Class B space). The Alamo Towers is located in the north-central market and is classified as Class B space.
