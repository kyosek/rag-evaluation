ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 51 Malls and non-controlling interests in 10 Malls as of December 31, 2020. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more anchors or junior anchors and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor and junior anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo was classified as a Non-stabilized Mall as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(3)
Excluded Malls - We exclude Malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded:
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the Property or convey the secured Property to the lender. Asheville Mall, EastGate Mall, Greenbrier Mall and Park Plaza were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2020. Hickory Point Mall and Greenbrier Mall were classified as Lender Malls as of December 31, 2019. Burnsville Center and Hickory Point Mall were returned to the lenders in December 2020 and August 2020, respectively. Lender Malls are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for Brookfield Square, Cross Creek Mall, Dakota Square Mall, EastGate Mall, Meridian Mall, St. Clair Square, Stroud Mall and WestGate Mall. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.
The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 2020. Due to temporary mall and store closures that occurred related to COVID-19, the majority of our tenants did not report sales for the full reporting period. As a result, we are not able to provide a complete measure of sales per square foot for the year ended December 31, 2020, and instead, presented below under the column Mall Store Sales per Square Foot the 2019 amounts (dollars in thousands, except for sales per square foot amounts):

Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 4,724 Mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 68.7% of the occupied Mall store GLA. Although Mall stores occupy only 34.8% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 65.2% is occupied by Anchors and Junior Anchors and a small percentage is vacant), the Malls received 77.7% of their total revenues from Mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2020.

See page 62 for a comparison between rents on leases that expired in the current reporting period compared to rents on new and renewal leases executed in 2020.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by its sales. Mall store sales represent total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet.
The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total Mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for each of the past three years:
(1)
In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls. The information in this table is based on 100% of the applicable amounts and has not been adjusted for our ownership share.
(2)
Due to the temporary mall and store closures that occurred, we do not believe occupancy cost to be an accurate measure for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Anchors and Junior Anchors
Anchors and Junior Anchors are an important factor in a Property’s successful performance. However, over the past several years the number of traditional department store anchors has declined, providing us the opportunity to redevelop these spaces to attract new uses such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness centers, casinos, grocery stores and lifestyle retailers that engage consumers and encourage them to spend more time at our Properties. Anchors are generally a department store or, increasingly, other large format retailers, whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the Property's tenants.
Anchors and Junior Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to non-anchor tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors and Junior Anchors accounted for 22.3% of the total revenues from our Properties in 2020. Each Anchor and Junior Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2020, the following Anchors and Junior Anchors were added to our Properties, as listed below:
As of December 31, 2020, the Properties had a total of 451 Anchors and Junior Anchors, including 56 vacant Anchor and Junior Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors and Junior Anchors at our Excluded Malls.
