Item 2. Properties
The Partnership has acquired a Limited Partnership Interest in each of the three hundred nine Operating Partnerships in six series identified in the table set forth below. In each instance the Apartment Complex owned by each of the Operating Partnerships is eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit. Occupancy of a unit in each Apartment Complex which initially complied with the Minimum Set-Aside Test (i.e., occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the Rent Restriction Test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to hereinafter as "Qualified Occupancy." Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective Apartment Complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable Report on Form 8-K filed during the past fiscal year. The General Partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
Please refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.
