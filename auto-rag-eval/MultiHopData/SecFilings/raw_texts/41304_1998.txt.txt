ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
The Company maintains its corporate office in Kirkland, Washington through its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc. Offices are located at the mines at, or near, Kemess South in British Columbia, Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, and Timmins in Ontario. The Company maintains an exploration office at Smithers in British Columbia.
SUMMARY OF MINEABLE (PROVEN AND PROBABLE) ORE RESERVES
Future production is contingent on available mineable ore reserves. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." The Company's estimate of ore reserves as at December 31, 1998 is presented in the following table using anticipated operating costs and a projected gold price of C$494 (equivalent to US$325) per ounce.
SUMMARY OF MINERALIZED MATERIAL
The following table presents the Company's estimate of mineralized material by property as of December 31, 1998. Mineralized material has been excluded from the mineable ore reserve estimates. The Company believes that adequate inspection, sampling and measurement has been carried out to indicate sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further exploration or development expenditures. However, these resources do not qualify under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission standards as commercially mineable orebodies until further drilling, metallurgical testwork, and other economic and technological feasibility factors based upon such work are resolved.
For details concerning the total cost and the net book value of property, plant and equipment at each of the sites, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
BRITISH COLUMBIA DIVISION
KEMESS SOUTH MINE
* Net of copper by-product revenue credit at US$0.73/lb
Note: In the period before the Kemess South Mine reached commercial production on October 1, 1998, revenue from the sale of gold-bearing copper concentrates was netted against start-up costs and deferred as pre-production expenses. From start-up until commercial production was reached, the mine produced 31,228 ounces of gold and equivalents, and 11,112,800 pounds of contained copper in concentrates from processing 4,587,143 tons of ore.
BACKGROUND
The Kemess South mine is located 182 miles northwest of Mackenzie, British Columbia, and to the east of Thutade Lake. Access to the area is by air from Smithers or Prince George to the 5,225-foot long gravel airstrip on site, and from the south by an all-weather private road from Fort St. James or Mackenzie.
In May 1993, Royal Oak acquired a 39.3% controlling interest in Geddes Resources Limited whose only significant asset was a 100%-interest in a block of mineral claims located in the vicinity of Windy Craggy mountain in northwestern British Columbia. In June 1993, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it would permanently protect, as a provincial park, the region that included Windy Craggy, and would provide compensation for holders of mineral claims in the area. Subsequently, in December 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, which includes Windy Craggy, a World Heritage Site.
In May 1995, the British Columbia provincial government commenced active negotiations with Geddes pertaining to compensation respecting Windy Craggy. In order to facilitate such negotiations, Royal Oak indicated to the British Columbia provincial government a willingness to purchase and develop the Kemess and Red Mountain properties, on condition the British Columbia provincial government provided appropriate project support and investment arrangements.
In January 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of Geddes, El Condor Resources Ltd. and St. Philips Resources Inc. at a total cost of approximately $202 million. The remaining outstanding shares of Geddes were acquired for shares of Royal Oak and cash with a total acquisition cost of $40.9 million. The outstanding shares of El Condor were acquired for shares of Royal Oak and cash valued at $110.6 million, and the outstanding shares of St. Philips were acquired for $38.6 million in cash. El Condor and St. Philips owned the Kemess South property and El Condor owned the Kemess North property. Through a series of transactions El Condor, St. Philips and Geddes were merged with Royal Oak.
The capital cost of the Kemess South Mine, concentrator and infrastructure facilities was approximately $480 million. Royal Oak received a total of $162.1 million from the British Columbia provincial government in compensation, economic assistance and investment to facilitate the development and construction of the Kemess South Mine. Construction at the mine site commenced in July 1996 and limited production began in May 1998. The mine reached commercial production in October 1998.
OWNERSHIP
The Kemess South property consists of 186 staked mineral claims and a mineral lease plus two Licenses of Occupation for power line and non-directional beacons that cover approximately 66,560 acres. Concentrate production at the Kemess South Mine is subject to two separate and distinct operating royalties. The Company is obligated to pay the British Columbia provincial government a net smelter return royalty of 4.8% on the value of all copper produced and sold from the
Kemess South Mine. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Debenture financing, the Company is obligated to pay Trilon a maximum royalty of 1.62% on all gross U.S. dollar revenue realized from the sale of concentrates from the Kemess South Mine. (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, there are two royalty agreements that affect a small number of claims.
At December 31, 1998, the net book value of the Kemess property, plant and equipment was $439.8 million (1997 - $520.0 million).
GEOLOGY
The Kemess South deposit is a large low grade gold-copper porphyry-type deposit. It is hosted by a flat-lying porphyritic quartz monzodiorite intrusion. Pyrite, the dominant sulphide, occurs as veins and fracture coatings accompanying quartz stringers. Chalcopyrite occurs as disseminated grains and in quartz stockwork veins. Native gold is included within, or is peripheral to, grains of chalcopyrite and gold grades correlate closely with those of copper in the hypogene zone.
The highest grade of gold and copper mineralization correlate with zones of intense quartz stockwork development.
A supergene zone, comprising 20% of the deposit, formed during a period of weathering synchronous with the formation of the Late Cretaceous Sustut Basin. Copper grades within this zone are locally leached or enriched, while gold concentrations remain relatively unchanged. Native copper is the dominant secondary copper mineral except at the base of the supergene zone where chalcocite becomes increasingly abundant.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
The mine plan contemplates that the Kemess South deposit will be mined at an average rate of approximately 113,000 tpd of ore and waste at an estimated mining cost of $1.69 per ton of ore. Processing at an average rate of approximately 51,000 tpd is projected to cost approximately $2.02 per ton of ore milled. The life of the Kemess South Mine is estimated to be approximately 13 years based on the average mining rate and current mineable ore reserves. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
The Company constructed a 380 km-long power line at a capital cost of $59 million that provides 90 MW of power to the Kemess mine site. The equipment at the Kemess South Mine is generally in good condition.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31,1998 the Company estimated the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserve on the Kemess South property to be 3,898,000 ounces of gold and 944,087,000 pounds of copper contained in 216,534,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.018 opt of gold and 0.218% copper. The estimate includes allowances for mining losses and dilution, but not for losses in processing. A net smelter return calculation was carried out on mineralization at the Kemess South property to determine the value that would be returned to the mine from mining and processing the ore. The estimate included all transportation, smelting and refining charges. The prices of gold and copper used in the calculations were US$325 per ounce and US$0.80 per pound, respectively, with an exchange rate of US$0.66/Cdn$1.00.
RED MOUNTAIN PROJECT
BACKGROUND
The Red Mountain project area is located in the Coastal Mountain Range, 11 miles east of the seaport of Stewart, in northwestern British Columbia. Currently, access to the property is by helicopter from Stewart, however, a road has been constructed to a potential portal site in Bitter Creek adjacent to the ore zone but at a lower elevation.
OWNERSHIP
The property consists of 127 staked mining claims that cover 79,089 acres. The Company acquired 100% of the Red Mountain property from Barrick Gold Corporation for one dollar and the obligation to spend $3 million on the property. The Company assumed all past environmental liabilities, estimated at $3.0 million, as part of this purchase. The Company expended $8.0 million on a surface and underground development program which was completed in late 1996, thereby fulfilling its expenditure obligation. Further development of the project has been postponed due to low gold prices. The prior owner is entitled to receive a 1% net smelter return royalty on all production from a portion of the property, and on
production over 1.85 million ounces of gold, an additional $10.00 per ounce of gold is payable. In addition, the Company is required to pay a 2.5% net smelter return royalty to a third party.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the British Columbia property, plant and equipment, including Red Mountain and the Smithers office, was $3.3 million (1997 - $10.3 million).
GEOLOGY
The Red Mountain orebody is a hydrothermal gold deposit related to a multiphase intrusion. Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Hazelton Group underlies the Red Mountain area. Early Jurassic plutons, sills and dykes have intruded this volcanic-sedimentary assemblage, the largest of which (the Goldslide-Hillslide intrusion) lies beneath Red Mountain. The orebody currently consists of three northwest plunging, southwest dipping elliptical zones located beneath the summit approximately at the contact between two phases of the Goldslide intrusion and hosted within both the stratified sediments and the Hillslide intrusion. Northwest plunging folds and at least two phases of brittle faulting have disrupted both the ore zones and the host rocks.
An extensive surface and underground drilling program was completed in 1996. The drilling showed that the JW Zone was truncated to the north by faulting or folding. However, drilling intersected Red Mountain type mineralization closer to the valley floor within a zone now called the SF Zone situated 1,000 feet below and 1,000 feet due north of the JW Zone. The short field season prevented sufficient drilling to fully define the SF Zone's extent and grade. No site work was undertaken in 1997. All permits have been maintained in good standing and routine environmental sampling was carried out.
MINING AND MILLING
It is estimated that over US$30 million was spent by former owners of this property, Lac Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corporation between 1991 and 1994 outlining and developing the Marc, AV and JW Zones, which included 300,000 feet of drilling. These zones remain open down-plunge and the exploration potential for the area north of the deposit is deemed by the Company to be excellent.
The Red Mountain deposit requires significant further exploration, ore reserve, and development work before production can commence.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the inventory of mineralized material on the Red Mountain property to be 981,000 ounces of gold contained in 13,238,000 tons at a grade of 0.074 opt of gold.
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES DIVISION
COLOMAC MINE
Selected Operating Data
*Mine reopened. **In 1994, revenue from gold production at Colomac was netted against start-up costs and the difference was deferred as pre-production costs.
BACKGROUND
The Colomac Mine, which is located approximately 137 miles northwest of Yellowknife in the vicinity of Indin Lake, was acquired in April 1993 from Neptune Resources Corp. ("Neptune") after having been shut down in June 1991. Stripping operations at the Colomac Mine recommenced in March 1993, and the first gold production was realized in July 1994. Operations at the Colomac Mine were suspended in December 1997 and the facilities were placed on care and maintenance. The property is accessible by winter road from Yellowknife for approximately three months each year and on a year round basis by chartered aircraft to a 5,000 foot airstrip at the mine site.
OWNERSHIP
The Company is currently seeking to option or joint venture the Colomac property which contains approximately 100 square miles of mineral rights and includes the more advanced areas described below. The Colomac property is comprised of 4 mining leases and 3 surface leases which cover approximately 3,400 acres. In 1993, the Company acquired the Colomac Mine and surrounding properties in exchange for the Company's Common Shares valued at $7,875,000. In a simultaneous transaction, the Company acquired the gross production royalty on the Colomac property in exchange for the Company's Common Shares valued at $4,000,000. The Company holds a 100% interest in the leases.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Colomac plant and equipment was $3.1 million (1997 - $11.9 million).
The option on the Kim/Cass property that was acquired in 1994 was returned to the owners in 1998.
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Colomac Mine is designed to use conventional open pit mining techniques. The mill, built in 1989, is a conventional 9,300 tpd CIP circuit with historical recoveries of approximately 88%. The mill circuitry was modified, including installation of a pebble crusher bypass in 1996, to overcome operating difficulties and to facilitate the processing of 10,000 tpd of ore. The plant and equipment are generally in good to excellent condition. Pursuant to closure of the mine, the power plant was sold. A number of pumps and ancillary equipment from the mill were moved to the Kemess South Mine.
GEOLOGY
The Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Precambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Kim/Cass zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the inventory of mineralized material on the Colomac property to be 185,000 ounces of gold contained in 3,180,000 tons at a grade of 0.062 opt of gold.
GIANT MINE
Selected Operating Data
BACKGROUND
The Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in continuous production since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all-weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the center of the property. Mining is conducted underground and an on-site mill processes the ore. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7.1 million ounces of gold.
In 1996, the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure that accesses the Supercrest orebody. Large-scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher-grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 opt gold in situ compared with 0.301 opt at Giant.
The Nicholas Lake property is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife and can be accessed by chartered aircraft from Yellowknife or by winter road. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements."
OWNERSHIP
The Company owns 100% interest in the Giant Mine property, consisting of 32 mining leases covering 3,050 acres and one surface lease covering 2,243 acres.
The Company purchased a 100% interest in the Nicholas Lake property in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., for $3.8 million. The Nicholas Lake property is subject to a 1% net smelter return production royalty and a $10,000 per year minimum advance royalty. The Company has no plans to develop the Nicholas Lake property due to low gold prices.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was $24.9 million (1997 - $57.2 million).
MILLING AND MINING FACILITIES
The Giant Mine operates as an underground mine with access provided by two large service raises, five declines and the "C" shaft, which is the principal operating opening for hoisting and extends to a depth of 2,124 feet. Mining is by conventional underground mining techniques such as cut and fill. The mine is mechanized with jumbo drills and 3-1/2 yard scoop trams. The mill at the Giant Mine is a 1,100 tpd milling and refining complex. The mine and mill operate on a seven day a week schedule. The power source for this property is Northwest Territories Power Corp. Power costs have increased significantly in the last several years and the Company has investigated alternative sources of power to reduce operating costs.
The Nicholas Lake deposit consists of eleven zones of mineralization. These zones are near vertical quartz-sulphide veins. The zones have been drilled from surface and underground at a spacing of approximately 65 feet. The orebody is accessed by a ramp that was driven in 1994 to a depth of 300 feet below surface. A total of 750 feet of cross-cuts and sills have been developed on two of the major zones in addition to detailed mapping and sampling.
The main infrastructure of the Giant Mine has been in place since 1946. An Edwards Hearth roaster was built in 1948 and a fluid bed roaster was added in 1950. In the mid-1950s, a state-of-the-art two-stage fluid-bed roaster and gas cleaning plant was constructed to replace the earlier roasters. In the early 1980s, a new effluent treatment plant was constructed, and from 1992 to 1994, the mill's flotation cells were replaced. The Company's fluid-bed roaster currently operates in compliance with all existing legislation and regulations. The Giant Mine's plant and equipment are generally in good condition.
GEOLOGY
The Giant Mine is in the Yellowknife Greenstone belt, a package of Precambrian basic volcanic rocks. Orebodies are hosted in shear zones within the greenstones. Individual orebodies are veins, quartz lenses, or silicified areas within the shear. Gold is associated with fine-grained arsenopyrite.
The Nicholas Lake deposit is a series of narrow, steeply dipping quartz veins containing gold, arsenopyrite and other sulphides. These veins occur within a granitic intrusive body.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998, the Company estimated the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserve at the Giant Mine to be 181,000 ounces of gold contained in 498,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.363 opt of gold. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.
REGULATIONS
Federal and Territorial statutes, ordinances and regulations govern operations at both the Colomac and Giant mines. Included under Northwest Territorial jurisdiction are the Apprentices and Tradesmen Regulations, the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Regulations, Business License Fire Regulations, Explosive Use Regulations, Fire Prevention Act, Labour Standards Ordinance, the Northwest Territories Mining Safety Act, Workers Compensation Act, Public Health Ordinance, Emergency Measures Act and Environmental Protection Ordinance. Under Federal jurisdiction are the Clean Air Act, the Fisheries Act, Northwest Territories Waters Act, Territorial Lands Act, Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and the Canada Mining Regulations. Failure to comply may result in cease work orders and/or fines. The Company believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any orders or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
In February 1999, the Company submitted a proposal to the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada requesting funds to carry out a feasibility study for an arsenic management project at the Giant Mine.
ONTARIO DIVISION
TIMMINS OPERATIONS
Selected Operating Data - Ontario Division
PAMOUR MINE
BACKGROUND
The Timmins operations currently comprise the Pamour and Hoyle underground mines and the No.3 open pit mine. The Pamour Mine is located approximately 15 miles east of the City of Timmins, Ontario, and has been in production since 1936. Both the Pamour and Hoyle properties are transected by Highway 101. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1936, the Pamour and Hoyle mines have produced in excess of four million ounces of gold.
OWNERSHIP
The Pamour property consists of 38 patented mining claims, 4 staked claims and one License of Occupation. Together, the property covers approximately 1,691 acres of mining rights and 1,575 acres of surface rights. Directly adjacent to the Pamour Mine is the Hoyle property that is comprised of 37 patented mining claims and 4 leased claims covering approximately 1,608 acres. The Company has a renewable 10-year lease on that portion of the Hoyle property lying south of the Timiskaming Unconformity where current mining operations are conducted. The lease terms include the payment of a minimum annual rent of $100,000, escalated by the Consumer Price Index, which is credited against a production royalty being the higher of $0.75 per ton or a 2% net smelter return. In order to renew the lease, which expires in 1999, for a further 10-year term, the Company must spend $1.0 million on exploration and mine one million tons of ore. Both conditions have been satisfied and as a result the Company is entitled to an automatic renewal of the lease. The Company has earned a 51% interest in the portion of the Hoyle property north of the Timiskaming Unconformity, which is not currently in production.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Company's property, plant and equipment at the Timmins operations, which includes 31,593 acres of exploration land and the area associated with the Pamour, Hoyle and Nighthawk properties, was $44.5 million (1997 - $81.9 million).
MINING AND MILLING
The Pamour No.1 Underground Mine and the Hoyle deposit currently produce a total of approximately 1,500 tpd of ore. The No.3 open pit operation also produces approximately 1,500 tpd of ore.
The Pamour No. 1 Underground Mine commenced operations in 1936 as the original Pamour Mine and has operated continuously since that time. The leased Hoyle Mine extension, which commenced production in April 1990, is the eastern strike extension of the Pamour orebody and is a large resource of bulk mineable conglomerate ore which has been accessed by a decline from surface and by underground drifts from the Pamour shaft. The underground mine currently produces approximately 1,500 tpd through a 3,145 foot deep five-compartment timbered shaft. The Hoyle property has the capacity to produce 50,000 tons per month. The mine is adjacent to the Pamour No. 1 operation and hosts higher-grade ore than present reserves at the Pamour No. 1 Mine.
Where possible, bulk mining methods are utilized, primarily by modified vertical crater retreat as well as sub-level blasthole stoping. The bulk mining areas are developed with large mechanized drill jumbos, scoop trams and trucks. Scoop trams and trucks move the blasted ore from the drawpoints to an internal pass. An electric trolley with 5-ton cars transports the ore from the internal pass to No.3 Shaft where it is hoisted by skips to the surface. Higher grade, narrow veins are mined by a modified open shrinkage method. The ore is developed and mined with jacklegs and stopers, which drill 1-1/4 inch blast holes. The broken ore is transported to the shaft by mechanized scoops, trucks and/or electric trains and then hoisted to the surface.
The No. 3 Pit is located immediately southeast of the Pamour Mill. This open pit was developed over the upper workings of the Pamour Mine and first came into production in 1985. Total pit production is approximately 1,500 tons of ore per day.
An additional jaw crusher was added to the Pamour Mine in the early 1990s. In 1995, all 25-cycle electrical motors in the mine were replaced due to the change in the power supply from 25 cycles to 60 cycles. Also in 1995, an additional ball mill was installed to increase capacity from 3,600 tpd to 4,000 tpd. A gold pyrite flotation concentrate is produced from the ore and is treated by a conventional cyanidation process to produce a gold precipitate that is refined into dore. The Pamour Mine plant and equipment are generally in good condition. The power source for the Timmins property is Ontario Hydro.
In 1997, the Company indefinitely postponed plans to expand the Pamour open pit and processing plant to a 15,000 tpd operation due to low gold prices.
GEOLOGY
The Pamour Mine is located approximately one mile north of the Destor-Porcupine Fault, an east-northeast to west-southwest striking structure. The majority of the historic gold producing mines in the Porcupine Gold Camp have been located near this structure. On the property, greywackes and a thick conglomerate, known as the Pamour conglomerate unconformably overlie a series of basic volcanic rocks. All rocks are of the Precambrian age. Gold occurs in narrow high grade quartz veins in the volcanics and in the sediments. The majority of the gold that has been mined from this property occurs in sheeted sets of quartz veins in the Pamour conglomerate and in the greywackes on either side of it. Gold also occurs in broad irregular zones of quartz veinlets in the volcanic rocks.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998, the Company estimated the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserve at the Pamour Mine to be 1,098,000 ounces of gold contained in 25,953,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.042 opt of gold. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.
NIGHTHAWK MINE
BACKGROUND
The Nighthawk Mine, which was operated by Porcupine Peninsular Gold Mines Limited between 1924 and 1927, is located east of the Pamour Mine. Royal Oak commenced production again in September 1995 after reopening the mine. Access is via highway, 10 miles from the Pamour Mill.
OWNERSHIP
The Company's land holdings in the Nighthawk Lake area are extensive with approximately 12,797 acres held representing 265 claims. Most of the property is held outright by the Company as staked claims. Other portions are held through various option agreements, which also provide for some form of production royalty. The Ronnoco claims on the east peninsula of the lake are held through a subsidiary company, Ronnoco Gold Mines Limited. The current producing deposit, the Nighthawk Mine, is located on the north peninsula of the lake and is subject to a production royalty being the higher of (i) $0.003 times tons mined times dollars per ounce of gold or (ii) 20% of the net profits.
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
During the period from 1924 to 1927, the Nighthawk Mine produced 99,628 tons of ore grading 0.32 ounces of gold per ton. Additional exploration was carried out periodically over the ensuing years. The Company developed the Nighthawk Mine and began production in September 1995. Current production is 900 tpd of ore from the Nighthawk Mine.
The orebody is accessed by a ramp that will ultimately be driven to 750 feet below surface. Mining methods for this underground mine are primarily longhole open stoping, with 50 feet between sublevels. Waste rock will be placed in stopes as delayed backfill. Ore is hauled to surface stockpiles in 30-ton capacity dump trucks. The material is then hauled by truck 10 miles to the Pamour mill for processing. The mine's equipment is generally in excellent condition. The power source for this property is Ontario Hydro.
GEOLOGY
The Nighthawk Mine is adjacent to a major structure called the Nighthawk Break, which is thought to be a splay off of the Destor-Porcupine Fault. The geology in this area consists mainly of steeply dipping volcanic flows. In the mine area, these have undergone intensive carbonate alteration. Gold occurs in quartz veins and silicified zones associated with minor amounts of sulphide minerals.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserve on the Nighthawk properties to be 144,000 ounces of gold contained in 2,720,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.053 ounces of gold per ton. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.
MATACHEWAN PROJECT
BACKGROUND
The Matachewan site is located approximately 56 miles southeast of the City of Timmins, Ontario and is accessed directly by Provincial Highway 566. The main area of interest is the site of two former producing mines located west of the Town of Matachewan.
The Matachewan property was mined from 1933 to 1957 by Matachewan Consolidated Mines and Young-Davidson Mines and produced a total of 956,117 ounces of gold grading 0.10 ounces per ton from both underground and open pit sources.
In 1997, the Company conducted a program of dewatering and rehabilitation of the Matachewan Consolidated Mine #3 Shaft to facilitate underground exploration of the existing mine and extensions of the deposit. Extensive design of facilities and infrastructure related to the final mining and processing plant was also undertaken. These activities progressed until August 1997, when due to declining gold prices, the Company postponed the project and placed the property on care and maintenance.
The #3 shaft has been dewatered and rehabilitated to the 1,200-foot level of the 2,450-foot deep shaft. In 1998, the mine was maintained in this partially dewatered state at the 1,200-foot level.
All permits for this advanced exploration phase are being kept in good standing. Federal approvals for the production phase are still in the review process under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. These approvals are not being actively pursued because the project has been postponed indefinitely.
OWNERSHIP
The Matachewan property is held under two lease agreements. The lease agreement with Matachewan Consolidated Mines Limited provides for advanced royalty payments of US$15,000 per year or rent of US$7,500 per year, depending on the current gold price. The Young Davidson lease agreement provides for advance royalty payments of approximately $40,000 per year. The property is subject to a minimum 3% net smelter return royalty.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Matachewan property was $13.6 million (1997 - $20.6 million).
GEOLOGY
The Matachewan deposit is hosted within a syenite body that has intruded along and near the highly deformed contact between Timiskaming Group sedimentary rocks and Larder Lake Group volcanic rocks. The main syenite body is approximately 2,460 feet long, 410 feet wide and dips steeply to the south.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserve on the Matachewan property to be 617,000 ounces of gold contained in 10,549,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.058 opt of gold. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.
DUPORT PROJECT
BACKGROUND
The Duport property is located on Shoal Lake, 28 miles southwest of the town of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, in the Lake of the Woods District. The development ramp is located on an island and is accessible by barge.
OWNERSHIP
From 1930 to 1950, various parties carried out intermittent exploration on the Duport deposit, including underground exploration. In 1973, Consolidated Professor Mines Limited obtained an option on the Duport property and conducted an extensive sampling and drilling program from 1973 to 1974. Subsequently, this option was exercised and Consolidated Professor acquired a 100% interest in this property after merging with Duport Mining Company Limited. The Company completed the acquisition of all of the shares of Consolidated Professor in May 1996 pursuant to a tender offer followed by a compulsory acquisition. There is a royalty payable to Union Carbide Canada Limited ("Union Carbide") equivalent to a 50% net profits interest until recovery of pre-production expenditures, up to a maximum of $2.0 million. Thereafter, Union Carbide will receive a 10% net profits interest until a maximum of $5.0 million in the aggregate has been paid. The Company also has a right, subject to certain terms and conditions, to buy back the royalty upon payment of a certain sum.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Duport property was $11.6 million (1997 - $16.4 million).
MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES
The Duport project is situated in the environmentally sensitive area of Shoal Lake, the source of Winnipeg, Manitoba's residential and commercial water supply. Environmental concerns were raised in 1989 by local cottage residents and the City of Winnipeg after Consolidated Professor announced its plans to advance the project to the permitting stage. The main concern was the perception of potential environmental hazards associated with the processing of the refractory gold ore and the disposal of cyanide treated tailings. Consolidated Professor had carried out impact and sensitivity studies over a six-year period to address these concerns. Following the Company's purchase of Consolidated Professor, all aspects of mining, ore transport, milling, tailings disposal and site reclamation were reconsidered with the objective of satisfying all concerned parties. Among other features, the redesigned development plan involved transporting the ore by truck to the mainland via
a year-round ferry to a mill site located 5.2 miles inland, outside of the Shoal Lake watershed. The new design concept effectively addressed every concern brought forth during the consultation process. The Company has completed a fisheries study in the potential tailings area in the Squaw Lake watershed. In due course, the Company plans to conduct studies to revise mining and milling concepts as part of a preliminary feasibility study on the Duport project. However, further work on the project has been postponed indefinitely due to low gold prices.
GEOLOGY
The northern end of the Lake of the Woods District is underlain by the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of an extensive Keewatin greenstone belt. In the general Shoal Lake area, two granodiorite intrusions, namely, the Canoe Lake Stock and the Snowshoe Bay Stock, intrude the greenstone belt assemblage and are separated by a five mile broad section of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. Within this volcanic pile is a wide deformation zone which hosts the gold mineralized zones of the Duport project which occur as en echelon lenses within highly sheared felsic tuffs.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated mineable (proven and probable) ore reserves to be 383,000 ounces of gold contained in 1,008,000 tons of ore at a grade of 0.380 opt of gold. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.

NEWFOUNDLAND DIVISION
HOPE BROOK MINE
Selected Operating Data - Newfoundland Division
BACKGROUND
The Hope Brook Mine is located approximately 5 miles inland from the southwest coast of Newfoundland, between the towns of Burgeo and Port aux Basques. Reserves and resources were depleted during 1997, which resulted in closure of the mine in September 1997.
OWNERSHIP
For five years, production from the Hope Brook Mine was subject to an operating royalty ranging from $1.3 million to $3.3 million annually in favor of the prior owner when the annual average spot price of gold exceeded US$380 per ounce. In 1996, the year in which the royalty expired, the royalty paid was $1.3 million. The Hope Brook Mine area consists of a 25-year mining lease, surface lease and extended exploration licenses which cover approximately 6,800 acres of mining rights and 490 acres of surface rights. The Company holds a 100% interest in the property.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the Hope Brook property, plant and equipment and the Cape Ray property was $6.6 million (1997 - $7.2 million).
MINING AND MILLING
The mine was shut down in 1997 after depletion of ore reserves and placed on care and maintenance. The Company considered relocating the mill to the Matachewan project in Ontario prior to indefinite postponement of the project due to low gold prices. The Company plans to sell the mill and mine equipment.
GEOLOGY
Gold mineralization occurs in an alteration zone of pervasive silica, pyrite, and pyrophyllite, which is approximately 4 kilometers long and 300 meters wide. The alteration zone exists within a mixed volcanic-sedimentary sequence. The Hope Brook orebody was located in the zone of alteration. Ore covered a strike length of 500 meters and extended from surface to a depth of 400 meters dipping steeply at an angle of seventy-five degrees.
ORE RESERVES
The Company ceased mining and milling operations at the Hope Brook Mine in September 1997 after depletion of ore reserves. The property no longer contains a mineral inventory.
REGULATIONS
The Newfoundland Division is governed by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Occupational Health and Safety Act, Department of Environment and Lands Act, The Mineral Act, Waste Material Act, the Regulation of Mines Act, and the Government of Canada's Fisheries Act and Environmental Protection Act, and all regulations passed thereunder. Failure to comply therewith can result in cease work orders and/or fines. The Company believes it is complying with the foregoing statutes and regulations where applicable and has not been the recipient of any order or directions in the past year other than in the ordinary course of business.
UNITED STATES DIVISION
COPPERSTONE PROJECT
BACKGROUND
In June 1995, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the Copperstone property, which is located 20 miles north of Quartzsite and 60 miles south of Lake Havasu City in La Paz County, Arizona.
OWNERSHIP
Royal Oak holds a 75% interest in the Copperstone property. In August, 1998 Asia Minerals, a 44.1%-owned affiliated company, purchased a 25% interest in the Copperstone property from the Company and acquired an option to earn up to an 80% interest in the property. The Copperstone property is held by the Company under a renewable 10-year lease agreement and consists of 284 unpatented mining claims totaling 5,680 acres located in La Paz County, Arizona.
As of December 31, 1998 the net book value of the U.S. and other (Namosi, Fiji) property, plant and equipment was $5.3 million (1997 - $4.8 million).
MINING AND MILLING
Between 1995 and 1997, the Company drilled in excess of 32,000 feet in 34 dual-purpose RC/Core holes to investigate the continuity and extent of auriferous, north-plunging shoots below the Copperstone open pit. The Company believes that excellent potential exists for the discovery of a well-focused, moderate sized, high-grade underground gold deposit. Several multi-ounce gold intercepts, including 2.04 opt gold over a core length of 25 feet have been intersected up to 600 feet north of the Copperstone pit. The mineralization in the D Zone is entirely oxide ore and is hosted in an intensely silicified and brecciated, semi-massive specularite-magnetite altered limestone unit. It appears extremely dense for gold ore.
The contoured grade thickness data suggest a periodicity of north-plunging auriferous shoots spaced about 300 feet apart. A predictable pattern of ore shoot geometry has been used successfully to optimize results in drilling for gold. The Company believes that there is very good potential for the discovery of additional gold-bearing shoots north of the present drill coverage.
Previous drilling by Cyprus Gold Corp. encountered high-grade gold values over significant widths from a parallel structure in the footwall below the pit floor. The intercept includes 0.646 opt gold over a core length of 15 feet and 0.268 opt gold over a core length of 40 feet.
GEOLOGY
Gold mineralization is confined to a moderately dipping, brecciated fault structure that cuts quartz latite welded tuff and limestone units. Potassium metasomatism has affected all of the feldspar-bearing rocks at Copperstone. This is believed to be a consequence of potassium-rich (evaporite) brines circulating downward in half-grabens developed during regional extension by detachment faults. Mineralization is present in the main breccia structure and is accompanied by metasomatic alkali depletion (potassium and sodium loss) and silica, iron, manganese and barium addition. The highest gold values are associated with quartz, specular hematite and chrysocolla.
ORE RESERVES
As of December 31, 1998, the Company estimated its 75% interest in the mineable (proven and probable) ore reserves on the Copperstone property to be 166,000 ounces of gold contained in 341,000 tons of ore at a grade 0.486 opt of gold. The estimate includes allowances for dilution and mining losses, but not for losses in processing.
INTERNATIONAL DIVISION
NAMOSI PROJECT
BACKGROUND
The Namosi property comprises 178,000 acres and is located 30 km northwest of Suva, the capital of Fiji.
In April 1997, the Company received consent from the Fijian government for the transfer of Namosi mining tenements SPL 1352 and SPL 1367 from Placer Pacific Namosi Ltd. ("Placer"). Following this consent, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc., received certification from the Registrar of Companies to carry out business as a foreign company in Fiji.
OWNERSHIP
Approval of the Namosi licenses was granted in August 1997 and as a result, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc. was granted the right to carry out exploration and related activities on the properties throughout 1998.
MINING AND MILLING
A detailed search for porphyry copper deposits began in 1968 when Australian Anglo American (Fiji) Pty Ltd. acquired the property. Between 1970 and 1990, various consortia conducted various exploration activities. Viti Copper Ltd. managed the project during the prefeasibility stage. Over 164,000 feet of drilling was completed and feasibility studies indicated material grading 0.43% copper for the two main Waisoi deposits.
From 1986 to 1989, Anglo Pacific Namosi Ltd. and Western Mining Corporation carried out exploration programs aimed at assessing the gold potential at the major prospects and in the vein systems peripheral to the porphyry copper deposits. In 1991, renewed investigations were begun by Placer and included 39 drill holes at Waisoi and 8 holes at Wainabama. Placer conducted a detailed economic study of the Waisoi deposit and concluded that the project required further geological exploration success to achieve viability.
In 1998, Royal Oak drilled one hole to a depth of 180 meters on the Wainabama deposit. Sampling, prospecting and mapping were also carried out in the Waivaka Corridor. The Company undertook a 1,000-sample hydrocarbon soil gas
survey covering the northern third of the island of Viti Levu to find a potential source of power that is critical to the development of the Namosi project. The survey resulted in the discovery of seven anomalies.
GEOLOGY
The major porphyry copper prospects are at Waisoi, Wainabama, Waivaka Corridor and Wainadoi, and there are a number of polymetallic vein and skarn systems around the periphery. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with high level intrusion of Wainamala tuffs and Namosi andesites. The main controls on porphyry intrusions are northeast and north northwest trending faults related to regional tectonics. High copper and gold values occur in the cupola region of the stocks and around brecciated, faulted and stockworked haloes.
ORE RESERVES
The Company has not included any portion of the Namosi property in mineable (proven and probable) reserves. The most significant part of the Namosi property is the Waisoi deposit. As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the mineral inventory on the Waisoi deposit to be approximately 9.1 billion pounds of copper and 4.0 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 1.0 billion tons at a grade of 0.430% copper and 0.004 opt of gold.
