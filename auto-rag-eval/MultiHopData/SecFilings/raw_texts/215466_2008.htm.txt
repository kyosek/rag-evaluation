SILVER AND GOLD MINING PROPERTIES
South America
Bolivia - San Bartolomé Mine
The San Bartolomé open pit silver mine, operated by Empressa Minera Manquiri SA (“Manquiri”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico Mountain bordering the town of Potosí, Bolivia. Access to the property and the Company’s pre processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potosí.
The mineral rights for the San Bartolomé mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian State Mining Company (“COMIBOL”). Manquiri controls 67 square kilometers under lease from COMIBOL and 16,600 acres under lease from the cooperatives at San Bartolomé and approximately 17.8 square miles of concessions at the Khori Huasi property, a gold exploration target south of Potosí. The San Bartolomé lease agreements, executed between 1996 and 2003 and with 25 year terms, are generally subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company acquired additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The Company incurred royalty payments for these mining rights totaling $6.6 million. commencing with operating activities in June 2008.
Coeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (“ASARCO”) on September 9, 1999. Manquiri’s principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolomé mine. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolomé.
We completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually. In 2003, SRK, an independent consulting firm, was retained to review the reserve/resource estimate to include additional sampling data to incorporate additional resources acquired with the Plahipo project at Cerro Rico. During 2003, we retained Fluor Daniel Wright to prepare an updated feasibility study which was completed at the end of the third quarter of 2004. The study provides for the use of a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit which will result in the production of a doré that may be treated by a number of refiners under a tolling agreement which results in the return of refined silver to the Company that is readily marketed by metal banks and brokers to the ultimate customer. During 2004, the Company obtained all operating permits and commercial construction activities commenced.
The property and equipment were placed into service in June 2008 and are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventative maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility. The San Bartolomé mine commenced production on June 27, 2008. Silver production for 2008 was 2.9 million ounces. Total cash costs per ounce for 2008 were $10.53 per ounce. Operational results continue to improve and the Company now expects production for 2009 to be approximately 9.0 million ounces of silver.
In November 2007, Bolivia’s Congress approved a reform to the mining tax code. The Bolivia tax rate on most mining companies has increased from 25% to 37.5%. However, mining companies similar to San Bartolomé that produce a doré product will receive a 5% credit based upon their specific operation. Thus, the tax rate for San Bartolomé will be 32.5%.
The Company obtained a political risk insurance policy from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (“OPIC”) and another private insurer. The combined policies are in the amount of $155 million and cover Coeur up to the lesser of $131 million or 85% of any loss arising from expropriation, political violence or currency inconvertibility. The policy is expected to cost approximately $3.4 million per year, which was capitalized during the development and construction phases and is now included as a cost of inventory produced (estimated at approximately $0.21 per ounce of silver produced) over the term of the policies which expire in 2019 and 2024.
The Company’s total capital cost (excluding political risk insurance premiums and capitalized interest) to place the mine into production was $237.9 million.
The silver mineralization at San Bartolomé is hosted in gravel (pallaco) and reworked gravel (sucu and troceras) deposits and oxide stockpiles and dumps from past mining that occur on the flanks of Cerro Rico. Cerro Rico is a prominent mountain in the region that reaches an elevation of over 15,400 feet (over 4,700 meters). It is composed of Tertiary-aged volcanic and intrusive rocks that were emplaced into and over older sedimentary, and volcanic, basement rocks. Silver, along with tin and base metals, is located in multiple veins and vein swarms that occur in a northeast trending belt which transects Cerro Rico. The upper parts of the Cerro Rico mineralized system were subsequently eroded and re-deposited into the flanking gravel deposits. Silver is hosted in all portions of the pallacos and sucus with the best grades segregated to the coarser-grained silicified fragments. These deposits lend themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. Of the several pallaco deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo and Santa Rita.
In 2009, exploration planned at San Bartolomé will consist of collecting additional data from new pits (pozos) to further define and/or expand the ore reserves.

Year-end Mineralized Material - San Bartolomé Mine
Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. The metal price used for current ore reserves was $13.25 per ounce of silver.
(2)
Ore reserves are open pit-minable and include variable mining recovery factors from 96.1 to 100%.
(3)
Metallurgical recoveries are variable per ore type but average 61.1% for silver and should be applied to the total contained silver ounces.
(4)
Ore reserves were prepared by B. O’Leary (Mining Engineer), J. L. Sims (Geologist), and A. Tattersall (Mining Engineer) of the Company’s technical staff.
(5)
Proven and probable ore reserves are defined by surface drill holes and pits (pozos) with an average spacing of no more than 70 meters. Proven reserves are those reserves in stockpile at the end of 2008. The grade of ore reserve block is determined by the grade of proximal drill hole and/or pit composites and three-dimensional models of geologic controls. A minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 composite were used to classify proven and probable ore reserves and variable geostatistical estimation variances. Mineralized material is similarly classified.

San Bartolomé commenced production in late June 2008.
Argentina - Martha Mine
The Martha mine is an underground silver and gold mine owned and operated by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which is located in the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina. Access to the mine is provided by all-weather gravel roads 30 miles northeast of the town of Gubernador Gregores.
The mineral rights for the Martha property are fully-owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., totaling 195 square miles (50,623 hectares) of exploration concessions (claims), 86.4 square miles (22,377 hectares) of discovery concessions, and 0.54 square miles (142 hectares) of exploitation concessions. Martha is centered on the exploitation concessions, which fully cover the area of the mine infrastructure and the ore reserves reported herein. Concessions do not have an expiration date; they are subject only to required annual fees. Surface rights covering the Martha deposit are controlled by the 137.8 square mile (35,705-hectare) Cerro 1o de
Abril Estancia which is owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Included on the estancia is a 60-person man camp, mine and exploration offices, and assay lab.
The Company acquired the property in 2002 through the purchase of a subsidiary of Yamana Resources Inc. for $2.5 million. The prior owner conducted minor underground mining on the near-surface portion of the Martha vein from late 2000 to mid 2001. The Company is obligated to pay a 2% net smelter royalty on silver and gold production to Royal Gold Corporation granted by Yamana Resources. The Company incurred royalty payments totaling $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Prior to 2008 we transported the Martha mine ore by truck approximately 600 miles by road for processing at the Company’s Cerro Bayo mill located approximately 270 miles away. In 2007, the Company commenced the construction of a 240 ton per day flotation mill which was completed in December 2007 and produces a flotation concentrate. During December 2007, the newly-constructed facility commenced operating. In 2008, we began shipping the concentrate to a third-party smelter located in Mexico. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power is provided by Company-owned diesel generators.
Production at the Martha mine in 2008 was approximately 2.7 million ounces of silver and 3,313 ounces of gold compared to 2.7 million ounces of silver and 4,127 ounces of gold in 2007. Cash cost per ounce of silver produced was $7.57 in 2008 compared to $6.27 in 2007. The increase in total cash costs per ounce was primarily due to an increase in labor and operating supplies and mill start-up related costs in 2008.
Total capital expenditures at the Martha mine in 2008 were $4.5 million and the Company plans approximately $1.6 million of additional capital expenditures there in 2009.
At Martha, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Chon Aike Formation. The veins and veinlets occur as sub-parallel clusters largely trending west-northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy) and native silver.
During 2008, we spent $2.9 million on exploration and $0.4 million on reserve development at the Martha mine, and $2.6 million at our other properties in the Santa Cruz province, to discover new silver- and gold-bearing veins and define new reserves. In 2008, exploration tested extensions at depth and on strike on the Martha, R4, Catalina, Francisca, Belen, Isabel and Betty ore-bearing structures. A total of 37,221 feet (11,345 meters) of drilling was completed in 2008. During 2009, we expect to spend $2.9 million on exploration for the discovery of new mineralization and reserve development, across all our large land holdings in the province of Santa Cruz.

Chile - Cerro Bayo Mine
The Cerro Bayo District is located south of Coyhaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and due west of the town of Chile Chico. The underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facilities lie on the east side of the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and are serviced by an all-weather gravel road from Chile Chico.
The mineral rights for the Cerro Bayo property are fully-controlled by Compañia Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd. (“CMCB”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, encompassing a 89 square mile contiguous block (23,106 hectares) of exploitation concessions and 18.1 square miles (4,700 hectares) of exploration concessions. The Company also controls several other concessions southeast of the Cerro Bayo District. The Company’s ore reserves and rights to operate are fully-contained within the exploitation concessions and separate surface use agreements from private surface land owners. Exploitation concessions are maintained by annual payments (taxes).
The Company acquired the property in 1990 from Freeport Chilean Exploration Company. No mining or processing was conducted by the prior owner. Initial mining and processing commenced, by the Company in 1995, at the Laguna Verde area, in the western portion of the holdings. Mining and processing temporarily ceased in late 2000 then recommenced in 2002 at the Cerro Bayo area on the east. The entire holdings and infrastructure are now referred to as the Cerro Bayo district. Construction of two ramps to intersect the high-grade Lucero Vein, in the Cerro Bayo zone on the east side of its holdings, commenced in November 2001. Additional mineralized high-grade gold and silver vein systems were discovered since then from surface and underground exploration.
The ore processing mill for the Cerro Bayo Mine uses a standard flotation process to produce a high grade gold and silver concentrate. During 2008, the concentrate processed at this mill was sold to third-party smelters, primarily in Japan and Mexico. The mill has a design capacity of 1,650 tons per day. During 2008, the Company experienced recovery rates of approximately 93.4% for silver and 90.2% for gold. Electrical power is generated on-site by diesel generators and process water is obtained from a combination of the adjacent General Carrera Lake and from tailings re-circulation. The property, plant and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Mining is conducted utilizing underground methods. Total capital expenditures at the Cerro Bayo property in 2008 were $8.2 million and the Company plans approximately $1.6 million of capital expenditures there in 2009.
Production at the Cerro Bayo mine in 2008 was approximately 1.2 million ounces of silver and 21,761 ounces of gold compared to 1.7 million ounces of silver and 37,479 ounces of gold in 2007. The decrease in silver production was due to a 39% decrease in tons mined. Cash costs per ounce of silver produced increased to $8.56 in 2008 from $8.22 in 2007.
On October 31, 2008, the Company announced a temporary suspension of operating activities at the Cerro Bayo mine due primarily to lower metal prices and continuing higher operating costs. During 2009, the Company will undertake efforts to further explore its holdings and develop a new mine plan and ore reserves in an effort to re-commence operations in 2010.
Silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets and lesser amounts of stockworks and breccias within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Ibañez Formation. Veins and veinlets occur in sub-parallel clusters largely trending north-northwest and dipping steeply to the west or east. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite and electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy). Numerous epithermal veins located within the Cerro Bayo district offer exploration and development opportunities for us. To date, we have discovered over 100 veins.
During 2008, the Company continued its exploration and development program in the district with its efforts concentrated in the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde zones in the east and west sections of the Company’s land holdings. In 2008, we spent approximately $2.7 million on exploration and $1.5 million on reserve development for new gold and silver mineralization and completed over 172,000 feet (52,456 meters) of core drilling. Most of this drilling was focused on exploration and definition of the new silver- and gold-bearing veins discovered approximately one mile east of the ore processing facilities at Laguna Verde; Dagny, Fabiola, Coyita, Yasna and Dalila. In the second half of 2008 a new vein, termed Delia, was discovered just to the east of the other veins. The Company plans to continue its extensive exploration and mine development programs in the district in 2009 with a budget of $3.9 million for this work.

USA - Rochester Mine
The Rochester Mine is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, which is located approximately 25 paved and all-weather gravel road miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The Company owns 100% of the Rochester Mine by virtue of its 100% ownership of its subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. (“Coeur Rochester”). The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, due south of Rochester.
Coeur Rochester controls 541 U.S. Federal unpatented claims (including 54 mill sites), 23 patented claims, and leases an additional 53 unpatented claims, totaling approximately 7,200 acres. All of the Company’s mineral resources and reserves are located within the claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and to Pershing County, which acts as administrator of the claims. Real taxes to the State of Nevada are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually; all leases are in good standing.
The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired initial interest in the adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003. Very limited mining and processing was conducted at Nevada Packard by the prior owner. Collectively, the Rochester and Nevada Packard properties comprise the Company’s Rochester silver and gold mining and processing operation.
In August of 2007, mining and crushing operations at the Rochester mine were suspended. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its estimates of silver ounces contained in the heap inventory. Consequently, the Company has extended the anticipated completion of its residual leaching phase from 2011 to 2014. At the Nevada Packard satellite deposit, located south of the Rochester deposit, the Company commenced mining of silver in the first quarter of 2003. Mining at Nevada Packard was completed in mid-2007.
The Rochester Mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid, telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office facilities. All of these facilities are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. The mine utilizes the heap leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined using conventional open pit
methods. The Company completed mining of the existing ore reserves in August of 2007. While mining operations were discontinued, it is expected that metal production will continue as a result of residual leaching until approximately 2014. Production at the Rochester mine in 2008 was approximately 3.0 million ounces of silver and 21,041 ounces of gold, compared to approximately 4.6 million ounces of silver and 50,408 ounces of gold in 2007. Cash costs per ounce of silver decreased to $(0.03) per ounce in 2008, compared to $1.52 per ounce in 2007. The decrease in cash costs per ounce is due to decreased mining and crushing costs during the year because mining and crushing operations were terminated in August 2007, as contained ore reserves were fully mined and placed on the heap leach pads for on-going leaching and metal recovery.
Based upon actual operating experience and certain metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate recovery rates from the crushed ore of between 59% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and 93% for gold.
The Company’s capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine totaled approximately $0.6 million in 2008. The Company plans capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine of $0.7 million in 2009. ASARCO, the prior owner, had a net smelter royalty interest which is payable only when the market price of silver equals or exceeds $22.54 per ounce up to a maximum rate of 5%. No royalties were required to be paid by the Company during the three years ended December 31, 2008.
At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, argentian tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein and vein swarms and stockworks) with variable but lesser amounts of pyrite.
In 2008, the Company commenced an exploration program to identify new silver- and gold-bearing structures on its large holdings in the district and to expand and define mineralized material occurring around the Rochester mine. Over 20,200 feet of reverse circulation and core drilling was completed at the new Mystic Springs targets and around the Rochester mine. During 2008, we spent $0.6 million on exploration in the Rochester area. The Company has plans to follow-up on any favorable results from this drilling in 2009.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - Rochester Mine
Year-end Mineralized Material - Rochester Mine
Operating Data
(1)
Current mineralized material is effective as of December 31, 2008. Mineralized material was estimated with a cutoff grade of 0.56 silver equivalent ounces per ton. Formula Ag equivalent = (Au*221) +Ag.
(2)
The mineralized material is in-situ and was estimated with gold and silver prices of $1,000 and $16.00 per ounce, respectively, historical metallurgical recoveries for gold and silver, historical mine operating costs within a non-optimized Whittle®
open pit model, and include no additional factors for mining dilution or recovery. The estimate of mineralized material was constrained to exclude any silver and gold mineralization beneath existing leaching operations.
(3)
The Company estimates the ultimate recovery to be approximately 61.5% for silver and 93% for gold. However, ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease which is currently estimated for 2014. Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery. Recoveries are calculated based on the ounces recovered as a percent of the ounces placed on the pad. As ore production ceased in August 2007, silver and gold recoveries increased significantly as a percent of ore placed on the pad. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Ore on Leach Pad.”
(4)
Mineralized material was estimated by J. L. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s technical staff. The firm of Reserva International, an independent consultant, was used to assist with modeling the results from the 2008 drilling conducted at Rochester to produce the new mineralized material.
(5)
Mineralized material is defined by drilling on grid of 100 feet by 200 feet, or closer, and includes open pit mine production sampling to assist with determination of gold and silver grades. In practice, the grade of mineralized material is defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. The number of drill samples used in estimation of grades must be at least 4 with a maximum search distance 150 feet at Rochester and 120 feet at Nevada Packard.
(6)
Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs.”
(7)
Mining and crushing operations terminated in August 2007. Residual leaching will continue until approximately 2014.
Australia
New South Wales - Endeavor Mine
The Endeavor Mine, an underground silver and base metal mine, is located in north central New South Wales, Australia, about 447 miles (720 kilometers) from Sydney. Access to the mine is by paved roads 30 miles (18 kilometers) to the northwest from the community of Cobar.
The ore reserves at Endeavor are covered by five Consolidated Mining Leases issued by the state of New South Wales to Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”). The leases form a contiguous block of 10,121 acres in size and expire between 2019 and 2027.
The Endeavor Mine has been in production since 1983. On September 12, 2003, CBH acquired the Elura mine and processing facilities from Pasminco and changed the name to the Endeavor Mine. On May 23, 2005, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (“CDE Australia”), acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine, which is owned and operated by CBH, for $44.0 million including transaction fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25 per ounce is also payable by CDE Australia in respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007, $2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable silver reserves under the terms of the contract. This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests acquired and is being amortized using the units of production method.
On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-sharing provision is deferred until such time as CDE Australia has received approximately two million cumulative ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever is later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. During late November 2008, the mine exceeded the two million cumulative ounce thresholds and therefore, CDE Australia realized a reduction in revenues of $73,318 as a result of the silver price-sharing provision. The conditions relating to the second payment were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In January 2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on April 1, 2008, plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. CDE Australia has received approximately 2.1 million payable ounces to date, and the current ore reserve contains approximately 13.5 million payable ounces based on current metallurgical recovery and current smelter contract terms. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the modified contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a result of the conversion of portions of the property’s existing inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries. CBH conducts regular exploration to discover new mineralization and to define reserves from surface and underground drilling platforms.
As of December 31, 2008, CDE Australia had recovered approximately 42.8% of the transaction consideration consisting of 2.1 million payable ounces, or 10.6%, of the 20 million maximum payable silver ounces to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement. No assurances can be made that the mine will achieve its 20 million payable silver ounce cap to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement.
The mine employs bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is sold to a third-party smelter. Silver recovery averaged approximately 56.5% in 2008 and 48.0% in 2007. Power to the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local communities. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition, by CBH, through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required.
Production at the Endeavor mine in 2008 was 824,093 ounces of silver compared to 772,609 ounces of silver in 2007. Cash cost per ounce of silver produced was $2.55 in 2008 compared to $2.67 in 2007.
The Company is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine.
At Endeavor, silver, lead, zinc and lesser amounts of copper mineralization are contained within sulfide lenses hosted in fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic-aged Amphitheatre Group. Sulphide lenses are elliptically-shaped, steeply-dipping to the southwest and strike to the northwest. Principal ore minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead and zinc rich sulphide zones.
CBH conducts regular exploration to define new reserves at the mine from both underground and surface core drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which is the fiscal year used by the operator (CBH), the exploration expenditure at the mine was A$0.9 million (US$0.6 million).

Operating Data (Coeur’s Share)
(1)
Ore reserves are effective as of June 30, 2008, which is the end of the most recent fiscal year of the operator, CBH. Metal prices used were $12.00 per ounce of silver.
(2)
The ore reserves are underground minable and include variable mining dilution (5% to 20% additional waste) and mining recovery factors ranging from 50% (for pillars) to 95%.
(3)
Metallurgical recovery factor of 45% should be applied to the silver reserve ounces.
(4)
Classification of reserves is based on spacing from drill hole composites to reserve block centers. For proven reserves the maximum distance is 25 meters and for probable reserves it is 40 meters. A minimum of 15 drill holes samples are used in estimation of ore reserve grades. Mineralized material is similarly classified.

New South Wales - Broken Hill Mine
The Broken Hill Mine, an underground lead, zinc and silver mine, is located in western New South Wales, Australia. Access to the mine is by paved roads leading from the adjacent community of Broken Hill.
The ore reserves at Broken Hill are covered by nine Consolidated Mining Leases issued by the state of New South Wales to Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. (“PBH”). The leases form a northeast elongate contiguous block of 18,502 acres in size and are currently being renewed. The new leases have various expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2024.
On September 8, 2005, CDE Australia acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces (24.5 million contained ounces), contained at the Broken Hill mine in Australia, which is owned and operated by PBH for $36.9 million including transaction fees. In addition, CDE Australia pays PBH an operating cost contribution of approximately $2.00 for each ounce of payable silver. Under the terms of the agreement, PBH may earn up to $0.75 million per year of additional consideration by meeting certain silver production thresholds. No additional payments pursuant to production thresholds were made during 2008.
The mine uses bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is sold to third-party smelters in Australia. Silver recovery averaged approximately 72.5% in 2008 and 83.6% in 2007. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition by PBH, through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power to the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local community.
As of December 31, 2008, CDE Australia had recovered approximately 120% of the transaction consideration consisting of 5.4 million payable ounces, or 31.4%, of the 17.2 million payable silver ounces to which it is entitled to under the terms of the silver sale agreement. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore
reserves will occur as a result of conversion of portions of the property’s inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries on the property. PBH conducts regular exploration to discover new mineralization and define reserves from surface and underground drilling platforms. For its fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, PBH has budgeted A$5.8 million (US$5.1 million) for this work. CDE Australia is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine. No assurances can be made that the mine will achieve its 17.2 million payable silver ounce target to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement.
Silver production in 2008 from the Broken Hill mine amounted to approximately 1.4 million ounces of silver compared to 1.6 million ounces of silver in 2007. The decrease in silver production is primarily due to an 18.5% decrease in ore grades. The cash cost per ounce of silver production, which includes the operating cost contribution and smelting, refining and transportation costs, was $3.41 in 2008 compared to $3.18 in 2007.
Silver, lead and zinc mineralization at Broken Hill is contained within sulfide lenses hosted in metasedimentary and igneous rocks of Precambrian-aged Broken Hill and underlying Thackaringa groups. In general sulphide lenses are tabular in shape steeply dipping to the north-northwest and striking east-northeast. Principal ore minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead- and zinc-rich sulphide zones but is higher grade in the lead zones.
PBH conducts regular exploration to define new ore reserves, largely from underground core drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which is the fiscal year used by the operator, A$11.3 million (US$7.2 million) was spent on near-mine exploration.

Discontinued Operation
USA - Coeur Silver Valley
On June 1, 2006, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary Coeur Silver Valley, Inc. to U.S. Silver Corporation for $15 million in cash and additional consideration received of $1.1 million for working capital. Coeur Silver Valley was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that owned and operated the Galena underground silver mine, an operating mine, and the Coeur and Caladay properties, which adjoin to the Galena mine, located in the heart of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District in Shoshone County, Idaho. Coeur Silver Valley’s property consisted of 6,131 acres of Company-owned fee land, patented mining claims and unpatented claims in addition to 4,800 acres of leased claims. Coeur Silver Valley’s operations were accessed by paved road from US Interstate 90 south of the town of Wallace, Idaho. Silver Valley recommenced operations at the Coeur mine in June 1996 and continued mining existing reserves there through July 2, 1998 when known reserves were depleted. Silver Valley resumed production at the Galena Mine in May 1997, and operations continued to the date of the sale.
The Galena Mine property was located immediately west of the City of Wallace in Shoshone County in northern Idaho. The property consisted of 52 patented mining claims and 25 unpatented mining claims totaling approximately 1,100 acres.
The Galena Mine was an underground silver-copper mine served by two vertical shafts. The No. 3 shaft was the primary production shaft and was 5,800 feet deep. The Galena shaft primarily provided utility access for water, electrical power and sand backfill for underground operations down to the 2,400 level.
The mine utilized conventional and mechanized cut and fill mining methods with sand backfill to extract ore from the high grade silver-copper vein deposits that constituted the majority of the ore reserves. Silver and copper were recovered by a flotation mill that produced a silver rich concentrate which was sold to third-party smelters in Canada. Silver recovery through the mill averaged 96% in 2006, the last year that the Company operated the mine.
Waste material from the milling process was deposited in a tailings pond located approximately two miles from the mine site. As of the date of the sale, the tailings containment pond, which was expanded on an as needed basis, had capacity for approximately seven additional years at current production rates.
Silver production at the Galena Mine in 2006, up to the date of the sale, was approximately 768,674 ounces of silver. Cash costs for 2006 were $9.75 per ounce. Total capital expenditures by Silver Valley at the Galena Mine in 2006 were $0.6 million.

SILVER AND GOLD DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
Mexico - Palmarejo Silver and Gold Project
The Palmarejo project is being built as an open-pit and underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facility, located in the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico. Access to the Palmarejo property is by paved and all weather dirt roads southwest from the capitol city of Chihuahua.
On December 21, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bolnisi Gold NL (“Bolnisi”) and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation (“Palmarejo”) resulting in 100% ownership of the project. The Palmarejo silver and gold mine is currently in the beginning stage of commercial production.
The Company’s property position at Palmarejo consists of 32 mining concessions totaling 46.9 square miles (12,141 hectares). Of the total concessions, 23 concessions consisting of 46.1 square miles (11,949 hectares) are owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. (Coeur Mexicana), formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), and the remaining nine concessions, representing 0.74 square miles (191.96 hectares) are held by Coeur Mexicana under various agreements and leases. All of the company’s reserves are located on concessions owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana. All concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until
at least 2029. In addition to the Palmarejo project, the Company also acquired the Yecora exploration-stage property located in Sonora, on the border with Chihuahua and the El Realito and La Guitarra exploration-stage properties in Chihuahua.
Total capital costs in 2008 were $190.3 million. This excludes $17.0 million of costs that were expensed as pre-development. The Company expects to spend approximately $100 million in capital expenditures during 2009. Silver production in 2009 is anticipated to be 5.4 million ounces and gold production is estimated to be 72,000 ounces during this initial year of operations.
On June 10, 2008, Coeur announced the results of a feasibility study for the Palmarejo silver/gold open pit/underground project. The feasibility study reflects results from geologic, engineering and economic analyses for only the Palmarejo deposit. This study established the first proven and probable mineral reserve for the Palmarejo project.
The terrain at the Palmarejo project mine is characterized by steep-sided hills and V-shaped valleys, although sites for mining infrastructures such as a mill should not pose a significant problem. Dumps and tailings will likely need to be placed within the upper reaches of drainage valleys, which would require the construction of a retention dam(s).
The Palmarejo mine is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest-trending Sierra Madre Occidental is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo project area, locally forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico.
The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo project, typical of many of the other silver and gold deposits in the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits, and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias and fractures. These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on the structures ranges from about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures gold and silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit to a gold-rich basal portion, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization. The Palmarejo property contains a number of mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the far north of the concessions which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine based on the northwest-southeast trending La Prieta and La Blanca gold-silver bearing structures. In addition to Palmarejo, mineralized vein and alteration systems in the Trogan license area have been identified on other strongly mineralized corridors, roughly sub-parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including Animas) and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property and are currently under investigation by the Company’s exploration teams.
The Company spent $8.6 million on exploration at the Palmarejo District in 2008, its first year of exploration since completion of the acquisition, to discover new silver and gold mineralization and define new ore reserves. Its exploration budget for 2009 is $8.2 million.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - Palmarejo Property
Year-end Mineralized Material - Palmarejo Property
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $13.25 per ounce of silver and $750 per ounce of gold.
(2)
The ore reserves are underground and open pit minable and include factors for mining dilution and recovery. For underground-minable reserves, 15% additional tons at 0.004 ounces per ton of gold and 0.46 oz/ton of silver was added for dilution and 100% mining recovery. For open pit-minable reserves, 10% additional tons at the same grades as mining dilution were added and a 95% mining recovery.
(3)
Metallurgical recovery factor of 90.8% and 93.8% should be applied to the contained silver and gold reserve ounces, respectively.
(4)
The ore reserves were estimated B. O’Leary (Mine Engineer), J. Sims (Geologist) and A. Tattersall (Mine Engineer) of the Company’s technical staff. Mineralized material includes estimates for the La Patria zone prepared by Mine Development Associates (“MDA”) as of September 17, 2007.
(5)
Proven and probable reserves are defined by exploration holes drilled from stations on a nominal grid spacing of 40 meters. Measured resources determination parameter is material demonstrating grade continuity that is less than or equal to 15 meters distance from the nearest hole, with a minimum of 5 samples, no more than 2 of which originate from the same diamond drill hole. The corresponding estimation parameter for indicated resource estimation is less than or equal to 35 meters.
USA - Alaska - Kensington Gold Project
The Kensington underground gold project, consisting of the Kensington and adjacent Jualin properties, is located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The mine will be accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilize conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. The ore will be processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which will be sold to third-party smelters. Waste material will be deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied to the site by on-site diesel generators. Access to the project is presently by helicopter, float plane or boat from Juneau.
Coeur Alaska, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Coeur Alaska”), controls two contiguous land groups: the Kensington and Jualin. The Kensington property consists of 51 private patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 766 acres, 407 federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 5,290 acres, and eight State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 95 acres. The Company controls the Jualin Property, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, through the cessation of mining, so long as the Company makes timely payments pursuant to the lease agreement. The Jualin Property consists of 25 patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 416.5 acres, 472 federal unpatented lode claims and one unpatented mill-site claim covering approximately 8,479 acres, and 25 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 381 acres. The Federal and State claims, as well as the private patented lode and mill-site claims, provide Coeur with the necessary rights to mine and process ore from Kensington. All of the Company’s ore reserves are located within the patented claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual filings and fees to the BLM, which acts as administrator of the claims. State claims are maintained via filings and fees to ADNR - Juneau Recorder’s Office. Real property taxes to the State of Alaska are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing.
The property is located on the east side of Lynn Canal between Juneau and Haines, Alaska. Coeur Alaska is obligated to pay a scaled net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur Alaska recoups the $32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after July 7, 1995 in connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at $400 per ounce gold prices to a maximum of 21/2% at gold prices above $475 per ounce, with the royalty to be capped at 1.0 million ounces of production.
