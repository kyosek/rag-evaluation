ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Gold Hill Projects
Overview
We hold leasehold interests within the Gold Hill Mining District in Tooele County, Utah, consisting of 296 unpatented mining claims, of which 295 are lode claims, and one is an unpatented mill site claim. This includes 42 patented claims, and three Utah state mineral leases located on state trust lands, all covering approximately 33 square miles. We have assembled all of our claims and leases in this district to create a sizeable, contiguous property package on which to conduct regional-scale exploration. Therefore, we intend to maintain our leasehold interest in the remaining mining claims for future exploration, if warranted. Over the next 12 months, if necessary funding is obtained, we intend to commence extraction of mineralized material from the Kiewit lode claims and construct and operate a heap leach facility nearby to process the material from the Kiewit claims.
The first phase of our activities has included the re-habilitation and redesign of the existing mills on the Cactus Mill site to create a pilot plant facility. Originally, a smaller mill operated on this site for several decades. A larger mill was built many years ago but required modification to accommodate the Yellow Hammer material. The rebuilt pilot mill was completed and testing was done in fall of 2010. In October 2010 we tested processing mineralized material from the Yellow Hammer claims. This activity was suspended in December 2011 due to permitting issues. We currently do not anticipate processing to resume any time in the near future. The second phase of our current operating plan will include construction of an 800,000 square foot heap leach pad and process facility near the Kiewit site to accommodate disseminated gold material from the Kiewit project. The construction of the heap leach facility and the proposed extraction activities on the Kiewit claims will require additional permits which we are in the process of securing from the appropriate governmental agencies.
We have no proven or probable reserves for this project. Management has decided, rather than allocating funds and resources on a final feasibility study and developing proven or probable reserves, to process mineralized material based on existing data supplemented with our own confirming work.
We do not have any current plans to conduct material exploration activity on the remaining Utah claims until and unless we are able to generate revenue from planned activities on our Kiewit project claims. At this time we do not consider these additional claims to be material to our current operating plan.
Project Location and Access
The Gold Hill Mining District is located in the Gold Hill and the Clifton 7½ minute quadrangles in western Utah. The district includes the north end of the Deep Creek Mountains, one of the nearly north-south ranges that are common in the Great Basin. On the east and north, the mountain area is separated by gravel slopes from the flat plain of the Great Salt Lake Desert, and on the west it is bounded by the Deep Creek Valley and groups of irregular low hills. It is approximately 190 miles west-southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, and approximately 56 miles south southeast of Wendover, Utah. The project is reached by taking Alternate 93A south from Wendover approximately 28 miles and turning east on to the Ibapah Highway, a paved two lane road. Approximately 17 miles east is a maintained two lane county road which provides access to the property approximately 11 miles southeast to the town of Gold Hill, Utah. Each of the claims and the mill site are accessible by dirt roads maintained year-round by us and Tooele County. Access to the property is maintained all year and we likewise intend to maintain roadways between the mining claims, the mill site and paved roads all year.
Mineral extraction activities on the property at this time will be open-pit with heap leach processing. We anticipate conducting underground exploration in the future.
History
The Gold Hill area is one of the oldest mining districts in the State of Utah. It reflects 43 known historical producing deposits mined primarily from the mid-1800s until the end of World War II. These deposits included gold, silver, copper, bismuth, lead, zinc, tungsten, arsenic, molybdenum, cobalt, and beryllium. Exploration and mining activities commenced in the mid-1800s as travel westward through the area to California was at its peak. Lead mineralization first attracted the attention of travelers prompting early prospecting. Placer gold was first discovered in the Gold Hill area in 1858. These early prospectors were hampered by repeated attacks of local Native American tribes and the area was abandoned until 1869 when the settlements of Gold Hill and Clifton were reestablished.
A lead smelter was constructed at Clifton in 1872 and relocated to Gold Hill in 1874. However, mining activity did not commence in earnest until 1892 when a mill and smelter were constructed at Gold Hill. Substantial quantities of gold and silver ore were processed at this site between 1892 and 1896. Mining activity gradually diminished until 1905 when exploration for copper revived the area. With the outbreak of World War I and the completion of the Deep Creek Railroad between Gold Hill and Wendover, a new revival of interest in the area commenced. Gold, silver, copper and lead were produced and approximately 3,000 residents lived in Gold Hill and Clifton at the time.
Tungsten was produced beginning in 1912. Significant amounts of gold and bismuth were also reportedly extracted during this period. Two mines produced tungsten in 1914 and 1917 and were operated primarily for the strategic requirement of tungsten during the two world wars. Gold and silver mining ceased completely with the beginning of World War II since the few remaining miners focused their attention on the production of strategic metals such as arsenic and tungsten to support the war effort.
Arsenic was produced beginning with the outbreak of World War I and was used primarily for pesticides in the cotton fields of the south. Two former copper producers also produced arsenic between 1923 and 1925. One of the mines reopened during World War II to produce arsenic for the war effort. None of the arsenic deposits previously mined are located on our claims.
The first large-scale geological study of the area was published in 1935 by T. B. Nolan as U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 177 and is referred to herein as the Nolan Report. The Nolan Report provided the first detailed data on the mining district.
The mining district remained largely dormant during the period after World War II through the mid-1970s. Between this period and the mid-1990s, several mining companies began to consolidate the fragmented land holdings in the area and a more regional-scale exploration operation was conducted. In 1993 Clifton Mining Company acquired several of the mining claims in the area and subsequently purchased Woodman Mining Company which also held claims in the district. After purchase of the claims, Clifton Mining commenced additional exploration activities and in 1997 developed road access up the Clifton Hills area. Clifton completed construction of a 50 ton per day mill at the Cactus Mill site and started construction of a 500 ton per day gravity-flotation mill at the same location. In 1999 Clifton Mining borrowed funds which financed upgrades to the mill.
Between 1994 and 1997 Kennecott Utah Copper, now owned by Rio Tinto, explored a large region of the district. In December 2002 Clifton Mining and Woodman Mining entered into an option-joint venture agreement with Dumont Nickel Inc., which in 2010 changed its name to DNI Metals Inc. The joint venture ultimately covered approximately 10.3 square miles of mineral properties but did not include the Yellow Hammer claims which were controlled by the Moeller family. In 2003 Dumont commenced exploring the properties with the objective of identifying bulk mineable gold, copper and silver targets through regional work as well as several drill programs. Beginning in 2004 Dumont completed a regional-scale grid and reconnaissance rock and soil sampling exploration program with detailed, targeted exploration work over the Clifton Shears Corridor, the Kiewit Zone and the prior zone owned by Kennecott. Ultimately, Dumont determined that the scale of the project was too small and decided to sell its interest in the project. In July 2009 Dumont completed the sale of all its mineral properties in this area to Clifton Mining Company for $255,000 cash and a 0.5% net smelter return royalty against future production proceeds from the Cane Springs Property and from portions of the Kiewit project claims. The joint venture and the option agreement were both dissolved and terminated.
Climate and Vegetation
The Gold Hill area lies within the region of the interior drainage that includes western Utah and most of Nevada, and, like the remaining portions of that area, is a high desert semiarid climate. The area is composed of a highly dissected group of hills of relatively low relief. The elevation of Gold Hill village is 5,321 feet. The Gold Hill area is bounded on the east by the Great Salt Lake Desert at an altitude of about 4,300 feet, on the north by Dutch Mountain with a higher elevation of 7,735 feet, on the west by Clifton Flat at an approximate elevation of 6,600 feet, and on the south by Montezuma Peak with an elevation of 7,369 feet.
Pronounced differences in temperatures between night and day are common, with the dryness of the air mitigating the high temperatures which predominate the summer days. Annual precipitation averages approximately 12 inches with about half falling in the months from February to May. Rainfall during summer to early fall is commonly in the form of severe thunderstorms. Snow may be expected between October and May. Fieldwork in the area is generally permitted throughout the year.
The higher portions of the Deep Creek Range and small areas near the summits of the adjoining mountains support a fairly heavy growth of yellow pine. The lower slopes of these mountains have a sparse covering of juniper and piñon trees. On the lower hills and on the gravel slopes surrounding them these trees give way to sagebrush. The floor of the Great Salt Lake Desert in the north-east corner of the district is almost completely barren of vegetation.
Title to the Claims
There are significant differences between the ownership rights associated with patented mining claims and those associated with unpatented mining claims. The granting of a patent is a relinquishment by the United States of its ownership of the land patented, and is the origin of private ownership of such land. Thus, the owner of a patented mining claim has a fee simple title to the mining claim so patented. The original locator and each subsequent owner of an unpatented mining claim, on the other hand, has only “possessory” title which is dependent upon maintaining possession and is subject to a paramount title of the United States. A mining claim locator’s possessory right is established by the physical act of “location” of an unpatented mining claim for minerals such as gold and silver on un-appropriated public land that is open to mineral location, and remains valid so long as the unpatented mining claim is maintained in compliance with the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, and other federal and state laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations require a mineral discovery, the making of the mining claim on the ground in a specific way, and the making of annual payments to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, referred to herein as the BLM, in order to maintain the unpatented mining claim. Because possessory title is dependent upon the factual basis of these requirements, a determination that appropriate documents have been recorded in the county in which the mining claim is located and filed with the BLM does not ensure valid possessory title.
A valid unpatented mining claim may be held indefinitely and the mineral deposit mined without obtaining a patent from the United States. There is no requirement that royalties be paid to the United States for minerals produced from unpatented mining claims. However, proposals repeatedly have been introduced into Congress that would substantially modify the Mining Law of 1872 which could require, among other things, the payment of royalties to the United States.
We believe that we hold valid leasehold interests in all of our Utah mining claims and state leases, in particular the patented Yellow Hammer claims, the seven unpatented lode mining claims known as the Kiewit claims, and the unpatented mill site on the Cactus Mill property. Nevertheless, there may exist conflicting interests in these claims. In 1996 Clifton Mining obtained possessory title to the Cactus Mill site under a quitclaim deed from American Consolidated Mining Co., which had previously quitclaimed the site to another entity which recorded the deed after Clifton Mining. Because Utah has a race notice recording statute and the Clifton Mining deed was recorded first, management believes Clifton Mining holds valid possessory title to the site which has been leased to us. In addition, a quitclaim deed recorded in 2009 from International Minerals & Metals Inc. and IMM-Dworkin Holdings, LLC to Clifton Mining references a royalty agreement granting a 0.5% royalty in favor of the grantors over a portion of the claims including the Kiewit claims. No royalty deed has been recorded and management has been unable to locate the royalty deed. Nevertheless, this royalty obligation may exist in favor of the original grantors. Management does not believe that any of the exceptions to clear possessory title to the claims raises a material risk to planned operations and Clifton Mining has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from certain potential encumbrances.

Geology
Our Gold Hill project is underlain by Carboniferous limestone and shale units of the Ochre Mountain Limestone, Manning Canyon, and Ochre Formations. Two distinctly separate igneous plutons intrude the sediments: a Jurassic granodiorite in the north and an Oliglocene quartz-monzonite in the south. Intense structural preparation is exhibited in different forms throughout the property with extensive primary north south fracturing exhibited in most areas. Considerable east west fracturing exists in the center of the project area and appears to control and/or host mineral occurrences. Generally, economic mineralization exhibits a close special relation to the Jurassic granodiorite with economic mineralization occurring both along the sediment contacts and the fractures within the intrusive. Nevertheless, there are no proven or probable reserves which would substantiate an established commercially minable deposit for extraction. The close, special relationship of the granodiorite to many of the mineral occurrences suggests it is the primary source of the mineralization. The Nolan Report described several separate faulting, folding, and mineralizing events in the district.
The Kiewit occurrence has been characterized as a hydrothermal disseminated gold zone in a highly fractured granodiorite intrusion. A specific horizon or low angle fault structure manifests itself as an anomalous gold blanket within the intrusion.
The Yellow Hammer mineralized material consists of several structurally controlled tabular and pipe-like copper, gold/silver, and tungsten zones hosted in the strongly altered quartz monzonite. Copper oxides consist mostly of azurite, malachite and chrysocolla. Sulfide copper minerals include chalcocite, chalcopyrite, covellite, and many other minerals including native copper. Tungsten minerals are primarily sheelite. Copper, gold, silver, and tungsten occur side by side within the shear zones.
Exploration Activities
Systematic exploration is ongoing at the Kiewit site on a limited basis. In addition, several other prospects including Oquirrh Springs the Frankie, the Lucy L and the Rustler have previously been sampled and evaluated. We do not have any current plans to conduct material exploration activities on the remaining Utah claims until and unless we are able to generate revenue from planned activities on our Kiewit project claims.
In the Kiewit area, based upon our calculation of mineralized material based on drill results from prior drilling performed by Dumont Nickel Inc. from 2004 to 2006 and recent metallurgical test work by McClellan Laboratories, we concluded that sufficient mineralized material was present to justify removing the material by open pit and processing it by leaching at a facility to be constructed near the Kiewit claims. McClellan Laboratories completed a column leach test which resulted in 70% gold recovery on minus 1/8th material and with modest reagent consumptions due to the nature of the deposit (granodiorite).
In 2011 we completed a 43-101 compliant resource calculation for the Kiewit deposit. The report included historical resource estimates as well as a general project summary.
Mineralization in the project area is manifested as: contact-metasomatic in and around limestone-granodiorite contacts (skarns), as fissure quartz-carbonate-adularia veins within the intrusive body itself, and as copper-gold replacement deposits within both the limestone and the intrusion. The report concluded that together these styles of mineralization are indicative of epithermal and related porphyry systems. Underlying thrust faults such as the Ochre Mountain thrust fault and the North Pass thrust fault along with numerous Mesazoic cross-cutting low-angle faults would have allowed magmatic or hydrothermal fluids emanating from the intrusion to migrate far from the intrusion and deep into surrounding wall rock. Clastic shale units within the property may have acted to form traps where migrating fluids would have deposited metals.
We believe the structural, lithological, and geochemical signature of the Gold Hill area is favorable for a porphyry copper-gold system (and related skarns) proximal to the Jurassic granodiorite, and for sediment hosted gold deposits distal to the granodiorite intrusion.
Exploration Plans
We intend to commence processing activities on the Kiewit Claims upon receipt of the necessary permits. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the material plans relating to these projects:
Cactus Mill Pilot Plant Rebuild. The Cactus Mill site is located approximately 1/3 mile north and west of the town site of Gold Hill and approximately four miles north of the Yellow Hammer claims. All needed access roads are already in place. Milling began on this site in about 1919. Prior to our recently completed rebuild project, the site consisted of two buildings with a concentrated storage area. Water for the area comes from the Cane Springs, located approximately 1,000 feet southwest of the pilot mill site and is piped to the pilot mill.
The pilot plant is comprised of a copper flotation circuit followed by flotation and gravity circuit for tungsten. Although most of the prior mill equipment is between 15 and 25 years old, it has been upgraded and modernized during this reconstruction process. A new feed system has been installed and all major electrical equipment has been rebuilt or replaced. A 350 KVA generator has been added to power the pilot plant initially, while a 150 KVA generator has been rebuilt to maintain support when the main generator is down. Two 60 KVA and one 70 KVA generators have been added as support for the water well and construction. We tested the facility during September 2010 and commenced processing mineralized material in October 2010. We spent approximately $1,000,000 on the remodel and reconstruction of the pilot plant.
From approximately September 27, 2010, until mid-October 2010, the pilot mill was in the startup testing phase. From October 20, 2010 through December 2011, the pilot mill operated continuously processing mineralized material from the Yellow Hammer claims. It is designed to operate at 10 tons per hour, but we have found that it operates most efficiently at approximately nine tons per hour.
We continued to adjust the specifications for the pilot mill to meet the requirements of the specific mineralized material fed into the plant. The flotation circuit performed approximately to plan in the oxidized horizon with copper recovery of between 50-60% depending on the exact feed, but the gravity circuit with the spiral classifiers followed by a Wiffley table captured more tungsten than expected and greater amounts of copper than anticipated. We estimate that as of December 31, 2011, we had produced approximately 385,000 pounds of copper concentrate and approximately 15,000 pounds of tungsten concentrate. We have currently suspended operations and processing of mineralized material and are concentrating our efforts on exploration and obtaining the necessary permits to proceed with larger scale mining at the Kiewit property. The pilot plant located on the Cactus Mill property remains on standby to process material from the district if needed as part of the Kiewit material processing.
Kiewit Gold Claims. Based on prior exploration work performed by Dumont Nickel between 2004 and 2006, management believes that mineralized material located on the Kiewit claims is a highly oxidized, highly fractured, highly disseminated and cyanide amenable hydrothermal gold deposit, with very minimal silver occurrences with the gold. Independent metallurgical testing by McClelland Laboratories in Reno, Nevada, has shown recoveries of 70% of gold are achievable with very low reagent consumptions but with the need for very fine crushing. We intend to extract mineralized material from three open pit mines and to process the material using a cyanide heap leach operation to recover gold and small amounts of silver. Mining, haulage operations, crushing and placement of the material on the leach pad is intended to be performed by outside contractors. The claims are located approximately 3000 feet northeast of the proposed leaching facility. Removal of mineralized material from these claims is subject to obtaining the necessary permits as discussed below.
Kiewit Heap Leach Facility. We intend to process any mineralized material extracted from the Kiewit claims through a heap leach facility we propose to construct approximately 3,000 feet to the southwest of the Kiewit claims on patented claims we currently lease. We estimate that the leaching facility would cover approximately 20 acres. The project will entail the construction of an 800,000 square foot clay and plastic lined pad and ponds and a 1,500 gallon per minute carbon column recovery facility. We have budgeted $3,500,000 to complete this project upon receipt of necessary permits as discussed below.
Permits
Utah regulations stipulate that, as long as any exploration projects on state lands are limited to an area within ten acres, there are no requirements to perform an extensive environmental assessment or compose a Plan of Operation. Larger projects would require a Plan of Operation which would consist of a reclamation plan and bond. The Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) has shifted some of its land management and authority to state agencies, such as the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (“DOGM”) which regulates mining activities on state and private lands. DOGM also shares authority with the BLM to stipulate and enforce environmental protection measures which are generally regulated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality. Our proposed exploration activities are located in the State of Utah and therefore require various filings with DOGM. DOGM requires all large mining operations to have an approved notice of intention and an approved reclamation contract in place and a surety bond posted. All small mining operations and exploration projects must have a complete notice of intention filed with the Division.
We have retained North American Exploration, Inc. of Kaysville, Utah, to assist us in obtaining the operating permits necessary for our principal projects on the Gold Hill claims. We have also retained JBR Environmental Consultants, Inc. of Sandy, Utah, to assist us with environmental issues relating to the permitting process. The property is located in an historical mining district that has existing disturbances and mine wastes and is in a very arid, desolate area. The property is also adjacent to, and uphill from, the Dugway Proving Grounds and Air Force Gunnery Range that is deemed an environmentally insensitive area. Existing water quality is low and relations with the few existing neighbors are good. Management believes that through our leased patented claims we have adequate private land for process facilities. There is no material access from any metropolitan area or community. Management believes that no previous work by any operator has been contested by regulators or others.
Set forth below is a summary of the status of the permitting process for the various segments of the project:
Yellow Hammer Small Mining Operations Permit: We hold a Small Mining Operations Permit from DOGM. This permit was approved by the Division on October 5, 2009. We have also posted a reclamation bond of $48,500 with the Division. This Small Mining Operations Permit stipulates that as long as any exploration or mining operations are limited to an area within ten acres, there are no requirements to perform an extensive environmental assessment or complete a Plan of Operation.
Cactus Mill Site: We currently hold a Large Mining Operations Permit from DOGM for the pilot plant which allows flotation and gravity concentration. This permit was granted in October 1995 to Ivanhoe Joint Venture and was ultimately assigned to us on April 6, 2009. We have also entered into a Reclamation Contract with the Division which was originally effective August 9, 2002, and transferred to us on April 6, 2010. We have also posted a reclamation bond in the amount of $42,802 for this project with the Division. Mineralized material for this pilot plant was generated exclusively from the Yellow Hammer claims under the above-referenced Small Mining Operations Permit. Operations at this plant are currently suspended.
Cactus Mill Heap Leach Project: The BLM and DOGM permitting processes have hampered this permit application making it too difficult to complete. Our plans to amend the Cactus Mill permit to include a heap leach project have been put on hold.
Kiewit Project: This deposit exists entirely on BLM unpatented mining claims from which an environmental assessment was previously completed by Dumont Nickel, a predecessor operator, on the affected area. The heap leach pad and process area will be located on patented mining claims approximately 3,000 feet to the southwest of the Kiewit claims.
In February 2010 we filed an application with DOGM for a Large Mining Operations Permit to commence large mining operations for three open pit mines and a heap leach gold facility. Final approval was received in November 2012. In February 2010 we also submitted a Plan of Operation to the BLM. Final approval is expected to be received in 2013. A separate Groundwater Discharge Permit through the Utah Department of Environmental Quality was issued on December 7, 2010.
In addition to completing the notice of intent filing, the BLM will require an analysis of our Plan of Operation in compliance with the National Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”). JBR Environmental Consultants has been engaged to prepare this analysis. The cost to date to prepare this analysis is $201,536 at December 31, 2012, with additional costs in 2013 expected to be about $50,000. We estimate approval of the Environmental Assessment (EA) in 2013. If we are not granted the necessary permits, our business could fail.
Yellow Hammer Exploration: In October 2008 DOGM issued an exploration permit for exploration of the Yellow Hammer claims which was used to conduct our drilling program on these claims in the fall of 2009. We have also executed a Reclamation Contract dated October 13, 2009, and have posted a reclamation bond with the Division in the amount of $12,300 for this project.
Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our planned operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or exploration costs or reduction in levels of mineralized material from future properties, if any, or require abandonment or delays in exploitation of new mining properties.
Water and Power
Pursuant to our lease agreement with Clifton Mining, we have access to Cane Springs, a natural flowing spring approximately 1,000 feet southwest of the Cactus Mill site, as well as the Cane Springs mine shaft located approximately ¼ mile south of the Cactus Mill. We have reconstructed pipe lines from Cane Springs and the Cane Springs shaft to the Cactus Mill pilot plant. Management believes the water from these two sources will be sufficient to operate the pilot plant and the initial operations at the Kiewit heap leach, if needed. We have been granted a one cubic foot per second water right from the Utah Division of Water Rights to provide water to the proposed Kiewit heap leach facility, which management believes will be sufficient to operate the proposed facility. We intend to construct a well adjacent to the facility to provide this water. Prior work on this site by Dumont Nickel has identified water at a depth of approximately 350 feet.
We believe that the generators installed with the pilot plant will be sufficient to provide the power necessary to operate the facility. We have installed an 8,000 gallon diesel fuel tank which we estimate will permit running time of approximately five weeks before refilling is required. We are also negotiating with a utility to provide a permanent power source by running power lines to the property for leaching facilities and pilot mill. We believe that all necessary easements are in place for installation of the power lines and estimate that the cost to install the lines would be approximately $13,000. We are also exploring additional alternatives for power to the property.
Offices and Other Facilities
We do not maintain separate offices for the company. Mr. Jorgensen, our CEO, provides office space in his home in Spokane, Washington, for our principal executive offices. Monthly rent for this space is $500 and commenced October 1, 2010. Mr. Havenstrite, our President, operates on site at our mining property in Tooele County, Utah. He also works from his office in Reno, Nevada. Monthly rent for the office space in Reno is $500 and commenced October 1, 2009. This office space is used primarily for RMH Overhead, LLC and Overhead Door Co. of Sierra Nevada/Reno, Inc., businesses owned by him. Agreements for the use of the office space facilities with these parties are month-to-month and can be cancelled at any time. Because of limited cash resources, these amounts are currently accruing rather than being paid. Total accrued rent to these officers at December 31, 2012 is $3,500.
We rent a core-logging facility located on the Tooele County airport grounds in Wendover, Utah. The facility includes a separate core splitting and sawing room, field supply storage rooms and sufficient floor space for logging tables and racks to hold over 21,000 feet of HQ core boxes. Monthly rent for this space is $350 and the rental arrangement is terminable at any time.
ITEM 3.
