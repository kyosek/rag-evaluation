ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
TCI’s principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for TCI’s present operations.
Details of TCI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2006, are set forth in Schedules III and IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.” The discussions set forth below under the headings “Real Estate” and “Mortgage Loans” provide certain summary information concerning TCI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
TCI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, properties held for sale, properties subject to sales contract, and investments in partnerships. The discussion set forth below under the heading “Real Estate” provides certain summary information concerning TCI’s real estate and further summary information with respect to its properties held for investment, properties held for sale and its investment in partnerships.
At December 31, 2006, none of TCI’s properties, mortgage notes receivable or investments in partnerships exceeded 10.0% of total assets. At December 31, 2006, 79.4% of TCI’s assets consisted of properties held for investment, 4.4% consisted of properties held for sale, 5.3% consisted of properties subject to sales contract, 3.2% consisted of mortgage notes and interest receivables and 2.4% consisted of investments in partnerships and equity investees. The remaining 5.3% of TCI’s assets were invested in cash, cash equivalents, and other assets. The percentage of TCI’s assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of TCI’s assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
TCI’s real estate is geographically diverse. At December 31, 2006, TCI held investments in apartments and commercial properties in each of the geographic regions of the continental United States, although its apartments and commercial properties were concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest regions, as shown more specifically in the table under “Real Estate” below. At December 31, 2006, TCI held mortgage notes receivable secured by commercial properties in the Southwest and Southeast regions of the continental United States, as shown more specifically in the table under “Mortgage Loans” below.
Real Estate
At December 31, 2006, approximately 89.1% of TCI’s assets were invested in real estate. TCI invests primarily in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or non-leveraged basis. TCI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships and properties held for sale.
Types of Real Estate Investments. TCI’s real estate consists of commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers), hotels and apartments having established income-producing capabilities. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. TCI may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Board of Directors may alter the types of criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
TCI typically invests in developed real estate. However, TCI also invests in unimproved land and apartment development and construction. To the extent that TCI continues to invest in development and construction projects, it will be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with higher risk projects.
At December 31, 2006, TCI had the following properties under construction:
No properties were completed during 2006.
For the period ended December 31, 2005, TCI completed the 70 unit Blue Lake Villas II in Waxahachie, Texas, the 272 unit Bluffs at Vista Ridge in Lewisville, Texas, the 232 unit Bridges on Kinsey in Tyler, Texas, the 208 unit Dakota Arms in Lubbock, Texas, the 240 unit Lake Forest in Houston, Texas, the 220 unit Wildflower Villas in Temple, Texas, the 398 unit Kingsland Ranch Apartments in Houston, Texas, the 240 unit Stonebridge at City Park Apartments in Houston, Texas, and the 240 unit Vistas of Vance Jackson in San Antonio, Texas.
The Company’s three office buildings in downtown New Orleans suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Management has worked with the Company’s insurance carriers to finalize all related claims. Repairs have nearly been completed for the Amoco and 1010 Common buildings. The building at 225 Baronne is
not open and few repairs have been completed. During 2006, TCI reduced the carrying value of 225 Baronne to $1.2 million, which approximated the value of the underlying land. TCI intends to redevelop 225 Baronne as an urban residential facility, which it considers the best and most profitable use of the property. In August 2006, to facilitate the marketability of the property, TCI acquired the Clarke Garage and 305 Baronne for approximately $14.0 million to provide additional parking and retail for the residential development.
At year end 2006, the Company had received approximately $49.2 million from its insurance carriers as reimbursement for both property damage as well as loss of rents. The Company has spent approximately $7.3 million to make necessary repairs to the New Orleans properties and has reserved approximately $7.2 million for additional repairs.
The Company is currently involved in litigation with certain parties including two parties who purchased properties from the Company but were still insured under the Company’s insurance policies and who suffered damage related to Hurricane Katrina. There is a dispute with these parties regarding the disbursement of additional insurance proceeds. At this time, there is no indication as to how this litigation will be resolved. Currently, the courts are holding approximately $50.8 million that is in dispute between the Company and the outside parties.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of TCI’s real estate (other than three hotels in the Midwest region, one hotel in Poland and 88 parcels of unimproved land, as described below) at December 31, 2006.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units and amount of commercial square footage and does not reflect the value of TCI’s investment in each region. TCI owns 88 parcels of unimproved land; 5 parcels, for a total of 44.82 acres in the Southeast region, 75 parcels, for a total of 5,984.22 acres in the Southwest region, 7 parcels, for a total of 118.92 acres in the Midwest; and 109.18 acres in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Following is a brief description of the most significant property acquisitions and sales in 2006:
New Orleans Properties
In August 2006, TCI purchased the Clarke Garage at 913 Gravier in New Orleans, Louisiana for $9.0 million cash. The property is adjacent to and includes 305 Baronne. 305 Baronne contains approximately 37,000 square feet of retail space and is currently occupied by retail tenants. 225 Baronne consists of approximately 417,000 square feet of office space and was significantly damaged during hurricane Katrina in September 2005. During 2006, TCI reduced the carrying value of 225 Baronne to $1.2 million, which approximated the value of the underlying land. TCI intends to redevelop 225 Baronne into an urban residential facility, which it considers the best and most profitable use of the property. To facilitate the marketability of the property, TCI acquired the Clarke Garage and 305 Baronne to provide additional parking and retail for the residential development.
One Hickory
In October 2003, TCI sold the One Hickory office building in Farmers Branch, Texas to IORI for $12.2 million and financed $12.0 million of the purchase price with a note receivable bearing interest at 5.49 percent per annum, maturing in June 2006. The $12.2 million sales price approximated TCI’s initial cost of acquiring the property in 2002 from ARI. IORI immediately sold One Hickory together with 202 acres of undeveloped land to a partnership, the general partner of which was then an affiliate of ARI for a total sales price of $37.2 million. In May 2006, the partnership sold One Hickory back to TCI in satisfaction of the $12.0 million note payable by IORI.
Circle C
In March 2005, TCI entered into an agreement to advance a third party $3.2 million for development costs relating to single-family residential lots in Austin, Texas. These advances are secured by stock in the borrower and hold a second lien on the undeveloped land. The secured note bears interest at 10 percent, requires semi-annual payments, and matures in March 2008. In September 2005, the total amount authorized under this advance was increased to $5.0 million. As of March 31, 2006, TCI had advanced $3.2 million to the borrower. TCI also guaranteed an $18 million loan secured by a first lien on the undeveloped land. In September 2005, TCI purchased for $4.1 million a subsidiary of Tacco Universal, a related party that holds two notes receivable from the borrower for $3.0 and $1.0 million, respectively. These notes are secured by approximately 142 acres of undeveloped land and membership interest in the borrower. These secured notes accrue interest at 12 percent, have an interest reserve for payments that is added to the principal balance on a monthly basis, and matured in June 2005. Both loans were extended to September 2005 and upon maturity were paid under the advance referred to at the beginning of this paragraph. In March 2006, TCI acquired all of the interests in the borrower, including ownership of the Austin, Texas land. The land is secured by the $18 million first mortgage and a $3 million subordinated loan. In March 2006, TCI secured a development loan of $31.3 million (secured by the Austin, Texas land), of which $18 million was used to pay the existing first mortgage. As of December 31, 2006 the development loan balance was approximately $22.8 million. The development loan matures in March 2008 and bears interest at Prime plus one percent. The Company intends to develop the land for sale to single-family residential builders.
Ewing Land
In December 2006, TCI acquired 17.0 acres in North Dallas known as the Ewing Land, for $3.4 million and a note payable of $10.8 million. The land was acquired for future development and borders the cities of Addison and Farmers Branch. The loan matures in December 2009 and requires interest only payments of 5.5 percent until maturity.
Galleria East
In November 2006, TCI acquired approximately 15 acres located at the intersection of the Dallas North Tollway and IH-635 (LBJ Freeway) in Dallas, Texas for a purchase price of $25.2 million. Payment was in the form of $8.8 million cash and a note payable of the $18.4 million due in December 2007. Terms of the note required interest only payments at 6.0 percent until maturity. The property is currently occupied by an automobile dealership which pays TCI a monthly rental for the use of the property. TCI intends to hold the land for future development or resale.
LaDue/Walker
In August 2006, TCI acquired from ARI, 99 acres in Farmers Branch, Texas known as LaDue/Walker for $21.5 million. Payment was made by an increase in the affiliate payable to Prime of $11.2 million and assumption of a $9.5 million note payable. Terms of the note require principal and interest payments monthly at 10.25 percent until maturity in December 2008. TCI intends to hold the land for future development as part of the Mercer Crossing development.
Galleria West
In November 2006, TCI purchased two parcels of land in independent transactions totaling approximately 9.2 acres in North Dallas for a total of approximately $7.5 million. Payment was made in the form of notes payable in the amounts of $1.5 million and $5.2 million. The notes require interest payments at 6.0 percent through maturity in December 2007. TCI intends to hold the land for future development or resale.

Properties Held-for-Sale. Set forth below are TCI’s properties held-for-sale.
Partnership Properties. TCI is a 30% general partner in Sacramento Nine (“SAC 9”), which owned the Prospect Park #29 Office Building. In December 2004, SAC 9 sold the Prospect Park #29 office building for $3.7 million, of which TCI received $1.1 million after closing costs and fees. TCI recognized a gain from the sale of $882,000.
In December 2004, TCI sold to an unrelated investment group a 95% partnership interest in Garden Centura, L.P. (“Garden Centura”). Garden Centura is the owner of the 410,901 sq. ft. Centura Tower office building located in Farmers Branch, Texas. TCI retained a non-controlling 1% general partner interest and a 4% limited partner interest in Garden Centura, L.P. TCI accounts for its investment in this partnership on the equity method.
Provision for Asset Impairments. TCI recorded no asset impairments in 2006, $3.4 million in 2005, and $6.1 million for 2004, representing the write down of certain operating properties to current estimated fair value. The asset impairment for 2005 relates to the following properties:
The Bay Walk and Island Bay Apartments are under contract to sell together and the contractual sales price was used as fair value. The impairment losses for these properties are included in 2005 discontinued operations. Centura Land was appraised for its sale to IORI and the appraised value was used as the fair value. The costs to sell are estimated closing costs and commission to be paid by TCI.
The asset impairment for 2004 relates to the following properties:
The Harmon and Mimado buildings were sold and the contractual sales prices were used as fair value. The costs to sell were the estimated closing costs and commissions to be paid by TCI. The impairment losses for these properties are included in 2004 discontinued operations. It was determined that the fair value of 225 Baronne was less than the current book value due to the pending loss of a major tenant. The Company intends to redevelop 225 Baronne as a residential project.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to investments in real estate, a portion of TCI’s assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally secured by real estate. TCI may originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of property sales. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes in TCI’s portfolio. TCI’s mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. TCI has originated its own mortgage loans, as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. Premier Funding, LLC, a related party, services TCI’s mortgage notes. TCI’s investment policy is described in ITEM 1. “BUSINESS-Business Plan and Investment Policy.”
Types of Properties Securing Mortgage Notes. The properties securing TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 2006, consisted of four office buildings, seven apartment properties, two parcels of unimproved land, two retail developments and various partnership and membership interests. Four mortgage notes receivable were unsecured at December 31, 2006. The Board of Directors may alter the types of properties securing or collateralizing mortgage loans in which TCI invests without a vote of stockholders. TCI’s Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.”
At December 31, 2006, TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio included 11 mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $22.9 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the continental United States, two mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $3.5 million secured by unimproved land in the Southwest region of the continental United States, five loans with a principal balance of $6.3 million secured by partnership or membership interests and four unsecured loans with a principal balance of $9.7 million. At December 31, 2006, 3.2% of TCI’s assets were invested in notes and interest receivable.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the mortgage note principal balance) by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as collateral for TCI’s mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2006. Excluded are $16.4 million of mortgage notes that are secured by unimproved land or other security, or are unsecured. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for further details of TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2006 is as follows:
During 2006, $20.8 million was collected in full payment of six mortgage notes and $2.1 million in principal payments were received on other mortgage notes. At December 31, 2006, less than one percent of TCI’s assets were invested in mortgage notes secured by non-income producing real estate.
First Mortgage Loans. TCI invests in first mortgage notes with short, medium and long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a “balloon” principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the borrower is required to provide a mortgagee’s title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders. TCI may grant participations in first mortgage loans it originates to other lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes first mortgage loans funded in 2006, as well as events during 2006 that affected previously funded first mortgage loans.
In March 2002, TCI sold the 174,513 Sq. Ft. Hartford Office Building in Dallas, Texas, for $4.0 million, providing $4.0 million in seller financing as well as an additional $1.4 million line of credit for leasehold improvements all in the form of a first lien mortgage note. The note bears interest at a variable interest rate, currently 8.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matures in March 2007. As of March 2006, TCI had funded $896,000 of the $1.4 million line of credit. TCI determined during the third quarter of 2005 that it would classify this note as non-performing due to the lack of debt payments received and the probability that no debt payments would be received in the future. In the fourth quarter of 2006, TCI and the borrower entered into an assumption and note modification agreement whereby the note receivable was modified to $3.6 million upon TCI’s receipt of approximately $500,000 from the original borrower. The original borrower subsequently transferred interest in the property to a new owner, which assumed the $3.6 million debt. The new note accrues interest at 8.25% for the first year, 9.25% thereafter, and matures October 30, 2008. As a result of the foregoing modification, TCI recorded a charge to earnings of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In December 2005, TCI sold 27.192 acres and 3.73 acres of the McKinney Ranch land to a third party for $10.1 million and $1.4 million, and provided $7.6 million and $1.0 million of seller financing, respectively. Both notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, require monthly interest only payments and mature in December 2008. In January 2006, TCI sold both notes to a financial institution for full face value less closing costs, plus accrued interest. The financial institution has a Put Option that would require TCI to purchase both notes back under the following conditions: (1) failure to construct agreed upon roads on the property by December 2006 (the road improvements have been substantially completed); (2) there occurs any event of default by the buyer; (3) certain escrow deposits for the road completion are not sufficient to cover the cost of the road construction; (4) any amendment, modification or assignment of certain development and escrow agreements between TCI and the buyer; and (5) failure of TCI to deliver certain documents to the financial institution within a timely manner. TCI and other related parties have also guaranteed the full payment of the note balances, including any outstanding interest and costs incurred by the financial institution.
Junior Mortgage Loans. TCI may invest in junior mortgage loans, secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10.0% of TCI’s assets. At December 31, 2006, 2.0% of TCI’s assets were invested in junior and wraparound mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loans that TCI originated in 2006 as well as events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 2006.
In August 2001, TCI agreed to loan Dallas Fund XVII LP up to $5.6 million secured by a second lien on an office building in Dallas, Texas. The note receivable initially had a variable interest rate, required monthly interest payments and originally matured in January 2003. TCI funded a total of $4.3 million on this note. In January 2003, TCI agreed to extend the maturity date to May 2003. The collateral used to secure TCI’s second
lien was subsequently seized by the first lien holder. In March 2004, TCI agreed to accept an assignment of claims in litigation as additional security for the note. TCI later agreed to a modification agreement with the borrower effective November 2003. As of the modified effective date, accrued interest of $582,000 was added to the principal balance of the note; the interest rate was fixed at nine percent per annum with all principal and interest due November 2005. TCI also received certain pledge and security agreements in various partnership interests belonging to the borrower and received various assignments of proceeds from asset sales in certain entities owned by the borrower. TCI reduced accrued interest and principal by $1.5 million from the receipt of notes receivable assigned to TCI by the borrower and by $605,000 from cash received. TCI also received $1.4 million in January 2005 that was applied to accrued interest and principal effective December 30, 2004. TCI received $1.8 million in September 2006 that was applied to accrued interest and principal. Through December 31, 2006, TCI has advanced an additional $3.0 million to the borrower. The following notes were assigned to TCI as payment on the note.
•
$678,000 from a partnership that owns an apartment building. This note is unsecured, bears no interest and has no maturity date. Distributions made from the partnership operations will be used to pay the principal on the note. TCI received $132,000 in distributions in 2005 and $27,000 in 2006.
•
$264,000, including accrued interest, secured by a second lien on 13 acres of unimproved land. This note bears interest at 9.0% and matured in February 2003. TCI’s parent company, ARI, has taken title to the collateral, giving TCI a first lien position on the collateral. This note is considered performing and no allowance has been established.
•
$466,000 secured by a second lien on 23.3 acres of unimproved land. This note bears interest at 4.0% and is payable upon demand.
•
$125,000 secured by a 100% interest in an affiliated company that owns an apartment building. This note bears interest at 12.0% and requires payments only if surplus cash is available and matures in April 2009.
In July 2002, TCI entered into an agreement with a third party developer to fund up to $300,000 under a revolving line of credit secured by 100% interest in a partnership of the borrower. The line of credit bears interest at 12.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matured in June 2005. This loan was extended to June 2006 in the second quarter of 2005 and was subsequently modified in the fourth quarter 2005. This second modification extends the loan maturity to October 2007 and limits any advances under the line of credit to $25,000 per month. As of December 31, 2006, the borrower had $153,000 of remaining available credit under the credit limit.
In October 2004, TCI sold the In The Pines apartments to a third party and provided $1.0 million of the purchase price as seller financing in the form of two notes. The first note accrued interest at 7.0% per annum, required monthly interest only payments and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance. In the event of a default, the note is also secured by membership rights in the purchaser’s entity. The second note was unsecured, accrued interest at 8.5% per annum, required monthly interest only payments and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance. Both loans were extended to October 2005 with the payment to TCI of a 2.0% extension fee. Both loans were paid in full, including unpaid interest, in October 2005.
In March 2005, TCI entered into an agreement to advance a third party $3.2 million for development costs relating to single-family residential lots in Austin, Texas. These advances are secured by stock in the borrower and hold a second lien on the undeveloped land. The secured note bears interest at 10 percent, requires semi-annual payments and matures in March 2008. In September 2005, the total amount authorized under this advance was increased to $5.0 million. As of March 31, 2006, TCI had advanced $3.2 million to the borrower. TCI also guaranteed an $18 million loan secured by a first lien on the undeveloped land. In September 2005, TCI
purchased for $4.1 million a subsidiary of Tacco Universal, a related party that holds two notes receivable from the borrower for $3.0 and $1.0 million, respectively. These notes are secured by approximately 142 acres of undeveloped land and membership interest in the borrower. These secured notes bear interest at 12 percent, have an interest reserve for payments that is added to the principal balance on a monthly basis and matured in June 2005. Both loans were extended to September 2005 and upon maturity were paid under the advance referred to at the beginning of this paragraph. In March 2006, TCI acquired all of the interests in the borrower, including ownership of the Austin, Texas land. The land is secured by the $18 million first mortgage and a $3 million subordinated loan. In March 2006, TCI secured a development loan of $31.3 million (secured by the Austin, Texas land), of which $18 million was used to pay the existing first mortgage. The development loan matures in March 2008 and bears interest at Prime plus one percent. The Company intends to develop the land for sale to single-family residential builders.
Related Parties. In January 2002, TCI purchased 100% of the outstanding common shares of ART Two Hickory Corporation (“Two Hickory”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARI, a related party, for $4.4 million. Two Hickory owns the 96,217 sq. ft. Two Hickory Centre Office Building in Farmers Branch, Texas. ARI guaranteed that the asset shall produce at least a 12.0% annual return of the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the asset failed to produce the 12.0% annual return, ARI was obligated to pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the asset failed to produce the 12.0% return for any calendar year and ARI failed to pay the shortfall, TCI could have required ARI to repurchase the shares of Two Hickory for the original purchase price. Because ARI guaranteed the 12.0% return and TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, and because ARI is a related party, management classified the consideration paid as a note receivable from ARI. In June 2002, Two Hickory was refinanced. TCI received $1.3 million of the proceeds as a principal reduction on its note receivable from ARI. In January 2005, the guaranty period ended and TCI completed the purchase of Two Hickory by recording the asset and the assumed debt, and removing the note receivable from ARI.
In April 2002, TCI purchased 100% of the following entities: ART One Hickory Corporation (“One Hickory”), Garden Confederate Point, LP (“Confederate Point”), Garden Foxwood, LP (“Foxwood”), and Garden Woodsong, LP (“Woodsong”), all wholly-owned subsidiaries of ARI, a related party, for $10.0 million. One Hickory owned the 120,615 sq. ft. One Hickory Centre Office Building in Farmers Branch, Texas. Confederate Point owned the 206 unit Confederate Apartments in Jacksonville, Florida. Foxwood owns the 220 unit Foxwood Apartments in Memphis, Tennessee. Woodsong owned the 190 unit Woodsong Apartments in Smyrna, Georgia. ARI guaranteed a minimum 12.0% return annually based on the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return, ARI was required to pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return for a calendar year and ARI failed to pay the shortfall, TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities for the original purchase price. Because ARI guaranteed the 12.0% return and TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, management classified the consideration paid as a note receivable from ARI. In July 2002, the Woodsong Apartments were sold. ARI received $2.8 million from the proceeds as payment of principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the note receivable. In October 2003, TCI sold One Hickory to IORI for $12.2 million, less prorations, for a wraparound promissory note of $12.0 million. This note bears interest at 5.49% interest, requires monthly interest and principal payments and matures in June 2006. This transaction effectively discharged the note receivable TCI had from ARI for the financing of One Hickory. Also, in November 2003, Confederate Point sold the Confederate Apartments and paid $2.1 million to TCI to pay off the loan and accrued but unpaid interest. In April 2005, the guaranty period ended and TCI completed the purchase of the Foxwood Apartments by recording the asset and removing the note receivable from ARI.
In December 2003, TCI purchased a note receivable secured by a second lien on 33 acres of raw land in Travis County, Texas known as “Pioneer Development”, at par value from ARI for $2.4 million as a paydown on an affiliate loan balance. The note bears interest at ten percent per annum, requires interest only payments beginning in November 2007 and matures in October 2008.
Other. In July 2003, TCI advanced $2.3 million to the Class A Limited Partners of TCI Countryside, L.P. of which TCI is the general partner. This loan bears interest at 7.25% and matures in January 2007. TCI also
agreed to advance $1.1 million to the Class A Limited Partners by advancing $105,000 in July 2003 and every year thereafter for ten years. This loan bears interest at 7.25% and matures in July 2012. Interest due to TCI will be deducted from the quarterly return owed by TCI to the Class A Limited Partners, eliminating the quarterly payments. In October 2005, TCI agreed to settle the remaining obligations under this loan by paying a lump sum of $425,000, making the total amount advanced $740,000. After January 2007, TCI may redeem the Class A Limited Partners interests in exchange for cancellation of both notes.
In March 2004, TCI sold the Texstar Warehouse in Arlington, Texas to BCM for $2.4 million, including the assumption of debt. TCI also provided $1.3 million of the purchase price as seller financing. The unsecured note bears interest at the prime rate plus 2%, which is currently 10.25%, and matured in April 2005. This note was extended to April 2008.
In March 2004, TCI sold a K-Mart in Cary, North Carolina to BCM for $3.2 million, including the assumption of debt. TCI also provided $1.5 million of the purchase price as seller financing. The unsecured note bears interest at the prime rate plus 2%, which is currently 10.25%, and matured in April 2005. This note was extended to April 2008.
In December 2004, TCI sold the Centura Tower office building to a partnership and retained a 1% non-controlling general partner interest and a 4% limited partner interest. TCI has certain obligations to fund the partnership for rent abatements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other cash shortfalls. $4.1 million of these obligations were escrowed by TCI with the lender at loan closing. Through December 31, 2006, TCI has funded $6.5 million of these obligations, with $6.5 million recorded in the form of a note receivable from the partnership. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum. The note will be paid out of excess cash flow or from sales proceeds, but only after certain partner preferred returns are paid.
At December 31, 2006, TCI owned 746,972 shares of ARI common stock which were primarily purchased in open market transactions in 1990 and 1991 at a total cost of $1.6 million. The executive officers of TCI also serve as executive officers of ARI. Prime also serves as advisor to ARI and at March 23, 2007, ARI owned approximately 82.2% of TCI’s outstanding Common Stock. At December 31, 2006, the market value of the ARI common shares owned by TCI was $6.0 million.
In November 2006, ARI purchased Windmill Farms, 3,035 acres in Kaufman County, Texas for $52.0 million. The purchase price was funded by $39.1 million debt and $10.0 million Preferred Stock of TCI. In connection with the purchase by ARI, TCI issued $10.0 million of Series D Preferred Stock to the sellers of the property. The transaction was recorded on the books of TCI as a reduction in the amount payable to affiliate of $10.0 million.
In August 2006, TCI purchased 99 acres in Farmers Branch, Texas known as the LaDue/Walker tract, from ARI for $21.5 million. The transaction was financed by assumption of $9.9 million note payable and an increase in the amount payable to affiliate of $11.2 million.
In May 2006, TCI acquired the 102,615 square feet One Hickory office building in Farmers Branch, Texas from IORI. The purchase price was paid by forgiveness of the $12.2 million note receivable from IORI.
