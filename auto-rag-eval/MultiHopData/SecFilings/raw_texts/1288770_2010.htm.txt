Description of Properties
Except for our Kibi Project, each of our other mineral exploration projects; namely our Kwabeng, Project, our Pameng Project, our Banso Project, our Muoso Project and our Edum Banso Project are currently at an early stage of evaluation. As at the date of this Report, no mineralized material or reserve estimates have been made at any of our Projects. As of the date of this Report, except for the 2011 Drill Program at our Kibi Project located on the Kibi Gold Belt, there are no exploration activities currently being conducted on our other Projects or have any such activities been planned for the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date. Prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year covered by this Report, we had completed preliminary lode gold exploration programs at our Kibi, Banso, Muoso and Edum Banso Projects and their respective results are noted hereunder.
Three concessions totaling 118.92 sq km; namely our Kibi Project, which is located to the south of our Kwabeng and Pameng Projects, and our Kwabeng Project and our Pameng Project, are contiguous to our Banso and Muoso Projects.
Title to Properties
We hold 30-year mining leases expiring on July 26, 2019 on our Kwabeng and Pameng Concessions (see “Kwabeng Project - Kwabeng Mining Lease” and “Pameng Project - Pameng Mining Lease”), a 7-year mining lease on our Apapam Concession expiring on December 17, 2015 (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease”), a 14-year mining lease on our Banso Concession (see “Banso Project - Banso Mining Lease” and a 13-year mining lease on our Muoso Concession (see “Muoso Project - Muoso Mining Lease”). Our interest in our Edum Banso Project is held through an option agreement (see “Edum Banso Project - Option Agreement for Prospecting License”).
VTEM Survey
As of the date of this Report, an airborne Versatile Time-domain Electromagnetic (“VTEM”), Magnetic and Radiometric survey (the “VTEM Survey”) was completed by our company on the above-noted Projects and encompassed approximately 4,000 line-kilometers at 200 meter (“m”) line spacing, with approximately 490 line-kilometers of detail 100 m line spacing coverage over the core Kibi Project mining lease area. The VTEM system is renowned for its superior penetration depth of greater than 400 m, low base frequency for enhanced penetration in conductive ground cover and high spatial resolution which permits the spotting of drill targets directly off the airborne anomalies. The primary purpose of the VTEM Survey was to delineate auriferous graphic or sulphidic shears but resistivity-depth data may also help further define and/or identify the granitoid bodies hosting the Kibi Project mineralization In addition to helping map lithological contacts, including the gold prospective granitoid bodies, the aeromagnetic survey will permit the detection of low-magnetic domains possibly reflecting demagnetization resulting from intense gold-related hydrothermal alteration. The radiometric survey may also help further define and/or identify the gold-hosting granitoid bodies. The VTEM will be incorporated into the geological compilation within the next few months upon reception of the final survey interpretation data from Geotech. This integrated survey, in combination with previous soil geochemistry and reconnaissance geology surveys will help further define the extent and regional controls of the gold-bearing structures discovered to date by scout trenching on the Ankaase Gold Trend, located on the Muoso Concession, and Banso Area No. 3 gold-in-soil anomalies; with the objective of guiding follow-up trenching designed to outline high priority, cost effective drill targets.
Recovery of Placer Gold
In 2007 and 2008, we recovered and sold placer gold from our Kwabeng Project. We did not recover any placer gold during 2009. During the Fiscal Year, in July 2010, we entered into (a) agreements with independent Ghanaian contract miners to recover placer gold and produce the mineralized material from our Kibi and Pameng Projects; (b) an agreement with Ravenclaw Mining Limited (“Ravenclaw”), a Swiss company, to assist in overseeing the contract miners to (i) limit our involvement in the recovery of placer gold operations; and (ii) enable our company to focus on the 2011 Drill Program and any other exploration activities we may conduct during 2011. Our General Manager of XG Mining received compensation from Ravenclaw for assisting Ravenclaw in fulfilling its contract with our company (see Item 11 - Executive Compensation - Summary Compensation Table and Item 13 -Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Consulting Agreement with Principal Shareholder” for further details.
Kibi Project
Overview
Our Kibi Project (also referred to as the “Apapam Concession”) is comprised of 33.65 sq km and our company’s interest in the Apapam Concession is secured by the Apapam Mining Lease controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; with the remaining 10% interest held by the Government of Ghana (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease”). Our Kibi Project is our company’s flagship project and is the only material project of our company.
- 18 -
Our Kibi Project land position also encompasses two (2) land staking applications: (i) a reconnaissance license contiguous to the southwest extremity of our Kibi Project covering an area of 7.0 sq km (700 ha) (the “Akim Apapam Concession”); and, (ii) a ground extension along the northwest boundary of the Kibi Project covering an area of 1.42 sq km (142 ha) (the “Apapam Concession Extension”). The Akim Apapam Concession was made to provide a buffer area. Our company has not conducted any exploration on the Akim Apapam Concession and there is no current knowledge of past exploration activity or lode gold on this ground. The Apapam Concession Extension was made to cover certain trench and drill gold intercepts. The applications for the Akim Apapam Concession and the Apapam Concession Extension were submitted by the Company to Mincom on January 15, 2008 and, as at the date of this Report, approval of these applications is still pending and there is no assurance that either of them will be granted.
The Apapam Concession contains two (2) small scale mining (“SSM”) licenses, comprising approximately 0.1012 sq km (10.12 ha) located within the northwest portion of the concession which were granted to third parties prior to our company’s application for the Apapam Concession. None of the in situ, lode gold mineralization occurrences described in the 43-101 Report are located within and/or proximal to these third party SSM licenses, and there is no current knowledge of any lode gold occurrences being present on these parcels. No information is available on past and/or current alluvial gold mining activity on these SSM licenses.
Location and Access
Our Kibi Project lies within the Kibi-Winneba area in the Eastern Region of Ghana and is located on the eastern flank of the Atewa Range along the headwaters of the Birim River in the immediate vicinity of the district capital of Kibi, approximately 75 km NNW of the nation’s capital city of Accra. Access to our Kibi Project is by driving northwest from Accra on the paved Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road which is the main national highway for approximately 90 km until the town of Kibi, marked by a road sign, is reached. One would make a left hand turn at the Kibi sign and drive southwest for approximately 5 km to arrive at our Apapam concession. A tarred road emanating from the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road approximately 15 km northeast of Kibi dissects the north-central and south-eastern portions of our concession, while the tarred road servicing the town of Apapam provides access to the concession’s south-western extremity. Our Kibi Project is located approximately 20 km south-southeast from our Field Camp.
The Kibi-Winneba area is characterized by a narrow sequence of Birimian metavolcanics underlying most of the Atewa Range, which is covered by an extensive laterite/bauxite capping, and surrounded by a thick package of Birimian metasediments dominating the flanks and the lower lying areas. Our Kibi Project covers the Birimian volcanic-sediment contact which we believe represents a highly favorable environment for the hosting of lode gold deposits throughout Ghana.
Historic Work
Prior to the exploration work conducted by our company as noted hereunder, very little systematic exploration work for bedrock gold deposits has been conducted in the Kibi area since the 1930s.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
General
All gold results for the following exploration programs are reported in “ppm Au” (part per million gold). The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for any exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
2008 Follow-Up Program
Exploration work on our Kibi Project located on the Apapam Concession during 2008 was aimed at advancing the lode gold targets identified within the the Kibi Gold Belt; an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four (4) extensive, higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area.
An extensive soil geochemistry survey covering approximately 47 line-kilometers (1,827 samples) was implemented in early 2008 to further define the extensive Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The entire Apapam grid was also covered by IP / Resistivity (62 km) and ground magnetometer (79 km) surveys to help map the extent of the granitoid bodies spatially associated with the gold occurrences, and to provide information on the strike extent and attitude of the mineralized structures.
Our Kibi Project trenching program encompassed 22 trenches totaling approximately 1,375 linear meters, including: 8 trenches (425 m) on Zone 2 (TKB006-013); and 14 trenches (950 m) on Zone 3 (TAD008-021) of the 5.5 km long Kibi gold-in-soil trend.
- 19 -
A Phase I scout drilling program (the “Phase I Drill Program”) encompassing 18 diamond drill holes, ranging from 60 m to 320.5 m in length, and totalling 3,001 linear meters was implemented on the Apapam Concession from August 30 to October 28, 2008. This reconnaissance drilling was designed to test the depth continuity of gold mineralization discovered in trenches excavated on Zone 2 and Zone 1 of our Kibi Project.
This initial reconnaissance drilling program yielded very encouraging results and demonstrated that the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization occurrences intersected along the Kibi gold-in-soil trend offers potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth.
At the time of the above-noted work programs, recommended work to further advance our Kibi Project included: (a) additional mechanical trenching to further define the geological / structural nature and extent of the granitoid-host gold mineralization in Zone 2 and 3; and (b) a 5,000 m combined reverse circulation / diamond drilling program.
Apapam Grid Expansion
The Apapam grid was expanded to provide control for detail (100 m) soil sampling coverage of the gold-in-soil anomalies yielded by the Phase I (2006) work program and the gold occurrences identified in the 2007 trenching, located at the northwestern extremity of the Apapam Concession, and for reconnaissance (200 m) soil sampling to follow-up on anomalous gold-in-silt samples identified in streams at the southwestern extremity of the property. A total of 54.45 line-kilometers of cross-lines and 2.1 km of baselines were established. The expanded grid now covers the entire northwestern portion of the Apapam Concession with a total of 78.8 line-kilometers of southeast trending cross-lines extending along a 6.1 km baseline.
Soil Geochemistry Survey
An extensive soil geochemistry survey was undertaken on the Apapam Concession to provide detailed (100 m) soil sampling coverage of the gold-in-soil anomalies yielded by the Phase I (2006) work program and the gold occurrences identified in the 2007 trenching, located at the northwestern extremity of the concession, and for reconnaissance (200 m) soil sampling to follow-up on anomalous gold-in-silt samples identified in streams at the southwestern extremity of property during the 2004 Regional Exploration program. A total of 1,827 soil samples were collected at 25 m intervals along the 46.975 line-kilometers of cross lines. Including the Phase I (2006) work program, a total of 2,859 soil samples have been collected on the Apapam grid.
The anomalous threshold for the soil sample results was set at 0.075 ppm gold based on past exploration experience on the Apapam Concession. 666 (23%) out of the 2,859 soil samples returned gold values greater than the 0.075 ppm anomalous threshold, including: 236 (8%) samples over 0.150 ppm; 95 (3.5%) samples over 0.30 ppm; and 61 (2%) samples over 0.5 ppm gold.
The expanded soil survey outlined an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend (“Kibi gold-in-soil trend”) characterized by four (4) extensive, higher grade zones (i.e. Zone 1 to 4) ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area. This gold-in-soil anomalous trend (> 0.075 ppm Au) tends to be patchy in nature and/or to pinch-out along its 5.5 km extent. The gold-in-soil anomalies exhibit a good spatial relationship with the bedrock gold occurrences identified to date in trenches at the northwestern extremity of the Apapam Concession.
IP / Resistivity and Magnetometer Surveys
An IP / Resistivity survey covering the entire 5.5 km extent of the Kibi gold-in-soil trend was conducted to help define drill targets for the Phase I drill program. The 61.9 line-kilometer IP / Resistivity (Time Domain) survey, covering the entire extent of the Kibi gold-in-soil trend at 200 m spacing, with some 100 meter detail sections centred on known gold showings, was conducted using a Pole-Dipole Array with a dipole length of 50 m and dipole separations of n = 1 to 6. This survey design should yield an approximate depth of investigation of about 175 to 200 m at n=6.
The IP / Resistivity survey helped map the extent of the granitoid bodies spatially associated with the gold occurrences identified to date by trenching and drilling, and yielded information on the strike extent and attitude of the mineralized structures.
A ground magnetometer survey encompassing 78.8 line-kilometers was also conducted on the Apapam grid. The magnetometer survey was implemented to help map the geology of the Kibi gold-in-soil trend area and to assist in the IP / Resistivity survey interpretation. The geophysical surveys were implemented in August to September 2008 by Sagax Afrique of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
2008 Kibi Project Trenching Program
The trenching program at the Kibi Project in 2008 (the “2008 Kibi Project Trenching Program”) encompassed 22 trenches totaling approximately 1,375 linear meters, including 8 trenches (425 m) on Zone 2 (TKB006-013) and 14 trenches (950 m) on Zone 3 (TAD008-021) of the 5.5 km long Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The 19 hand dug and 3 mechanical trenches, ranging from 20 m to 154 m in length and from 1.5 m to 4.0 m in depth, were designed to test the geochemical signature at depth, within the in situ saprolite (oxidized rock) horizon, of the gold-in-soil anomalies. As at the year ended December 31, 2008, a total of 35 trenches totaling approximately 2,320 m have been excavated on our Kibi Project.
- 20 -
Trenching exposed widespread occurrences of classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization in Zone 2 and 3. Mineralization is hosted by swarms of granitoid bodies interpreted to be emplaced along splay structures off an inferred NE-trending regional structure. The broadly spaced trenching encountered significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization, over trench lengths ranging from 10 m to 45 m, spread out over approximately 975 m and 500 m E-W distances in Zone 2 and 3, respectively. In addition several granitoid occurrences yielded lower grade but still exploration significant anomalous gold values. Significant gold intercepts from the 2008 Kibi Project Trenching Program, as well as significant intercepts from the 2007 Zone 2 trenching, are presented in Table 3 below. The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
A total of 14 manual trenches totaling approximately 950 linear meters (TAD008-TAD021) were completed in 2008 on Zone 3 of the Kibi gold-in-soil trend, located approximately 700 m southwest of the Phase I drilling area on Zone 2. To date saprolitic occurrences of altered granitoid exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and oxidized sulphide sites have been encountered in six (6) trenches on Zone 3.
The Zone 3 trenching yielded two (2) significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts: 4.93 ppm gold over 45 m, including 10.12 ppm gold over 12 m; and 1.60 ppm gold over 18 m, including 9.89 ppm gold over 2 m, in trenches TAD019 and TAD016, respectively. In addition, reconnaissance trenching of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly in 2007 yielded an intercept of 1.09 ppm gold over a 10 m trench length in trench TAD001-TAD004. The remaining three (3) mineralized granitoid occurrences yielded lower grade but exploration significant, anomalous gold values.

Results of Phase I Drill Program
The Phase I Drill Program on our Kibi Project encompassed 18 diamond drill holes (NQ2 core), ranging from 60 m to 320.5 m in length, and totaling 3,001 linear meters. This reconnaissance drilling was designed to test the depth continuity of gold mineralization discovered in trenches excavated on Zone 2 and Zone 1 of our Kibi Project; an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four (4) extensive, higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area. The Phase I Drill Program was implemented from August 30 to October 28, 2008 by Burwash Drilling of Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada.
This initial reconnaissance drilling program yielded very encouraging results and demonstrated that the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization occurrences intersected along the Kibi gold-in-soil trend offers potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth.
The first 15 holes of the Phase II Drill Program targeted gold mineralization discovered in four (4) trenches, TKB005, TKB004, TKB006, and TKB009-010, spread out over an approximately 975 m E-W distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Thirteen (13) out of the 15 holes on Zone 2 yielded significant gold intercepts, including 10 holes intersecting significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over 7 m to 45 m core lengths. Significant gold intercepts are presented in Table 4 below. The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining, and disseminated sulphides. Mineralization discovered by trenching and/or drilling on Zone 2 and Zone 3 appears to be hosted by swarms of granitoid bodies, ranging from 5.5 m to 79 m in core length, interpreted to be emplaced along splay structures off an inferred NE-trending regional structure.
Limited drilling to date traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over a 200 m strike length and to a vertical depth of 100 m at the Trench TKB004 Zone, including gold intercepts of: 2.11 ppm gold over 25.4 m; 0.87 ppm gold over 15 m and 1.28 ppm gold over 33 m; 2.24 ppm gold over 16 m; and 2.78 ppm gold over 15 m in holes KBD08012, KBD08013, KBD08014, and KBD08015, respectively. Similarly, mineralization at the Trench TKB005 Zone was traced over an approximately 135 m strike length and to a vertical depth of 76 m in holes KBD08003 and KBD08004 and KBD08010 and KBD08011, including significant intercepts of 8.49 ppm gold over 12 m and 4.83 ppm gold over 7 m in holes KBD08004 and KBD08010, respectively.
Limited Zone 1 scout drilling (3 holes) intersected a typical “Ashanti” style shear zone setting developed proximal to a metavolcanic-metasediment contact with a spatially associated granitoid body. Hole KBD08017 yielded intermittent, exploration significant, anomalous gold values over a 60 m core length, including encouraging intercepts of 1.43 ppm gold over 13.5 m, 1.04 ppm gold over 6 m, and 1.02 ppm gold over 8 m. In addition, Trench TKB012 excavated on a gold-in-soil anomaly, located approximately 100 m west of hole KBD08017, returned a channel sample intercept of 2.51 ppm gold over a 4 m trench length.
Recommended work to further advance our Project includes: (a) additional mechanical trenching to further define the geological / structural nature and extent of the granitoid-host gold mineralization in Zone 2 and 3; and (b) a 5,000 m combined reverse circulation / diamond drilling program. The estimated cost of the follow-up exploration program is approximately $800,000.

Phase II Drill Program
The Phase II drill program (the “Phase II Drill Program”) on our Kibi Project encompassed 50 RC holes, ranging from 40 m to 150 m in length, and totalling 4,715 linear meters including 27 holes for 2,478 m on Zone 2 and 23 holes totaling 2,237 m on Zone 3. Fifteen initial RC holes targeted the Trench TKB005 and Trench TKB004 gold zones located at the southeast extremity of Zone 2 of the Kibi Gold Trend; an over 5.5 km long, northeast trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four extensive higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75 to 300 m to 1,000 m by 100 to 500 m in area. The Phase II Drill Program was designed to: (i) test the dip and strike extensions of the four gold target zones identified in Zone 2 during the Phase I Drill Program; (ii) assess the depth continuity of gold mineralization discovered in trenches excavated in Zone 3, an approximately 1,000 m by 100 to 500 m gold-in-soil anomaly located approximately 700 m southwest of the Zone 2 drilling conducted under the Phase I Drill Program in 2008; and (iii) test IP / Resistivity anomalies spatially associated with the Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The Phase II Drill Program was designed to build upon the 2008 Phase I diamond drill results and to continue to demonstrate that the widespread, classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization developed along our Kibi Project offers potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth. The Phase II Drill Program was implemented from July 14, 2009 to September 26, 2009 by BLY Ghana Ltd., a subsidiary of Boart Longyear.

Drilling Results from Trenches TKB005 and TKB004 Zones (15 Holes) - Zone 2 - Kibi Project
Eleven out of the initial 15 of the 27 RC holes on Zone 2 yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from one m to 78 m in core length. Mineralization identified by trenching and drilling on Zone 2 appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence. Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides. Significant gold intercepts for the Trench TKB005 and TKB004 zones are set forth in Table 3 hereunder.
As at September 28, 2009, gold mineralization at the Trench TKB005 zone has been traced over an approximately 220 m strike length and to a vertical depth of approximately 75 m. Highlights from the present drilling includes intercepts of 6.29 g/t over 23 m, including 8.55 g/t over 10 m, in hole KBRC09047 and 2.97 g/t over 18 m, including 6.32 g/t over 8 M in hole KBRC09042. These two holes tested the central portion of the zone in a scissor pattern designed to better characterize the lithological and structural controls of the gold mineralization intersected in diamond drill holes KBD08003 and KBD08004 from the Phase I drill program. Field and trench mapping indicates that the Trench TKB005 zone mineralization is hosted by a moderate, easterly dipping granitoid body exhibiting an extensive, shallow to moderate, westerly dipping, sheeted quartz vein system. Hole KBD09042 (270° AZ / -50° dip) intersected the host granitoid sill at approximately right angles from a collar position on the eastern (hanging wall) flank of the granitoid body. While hole KBRC09047 (090° Az / -55° dip) was drilled down the dip of the host granitoid sill in order to transect the westerly dipping, sheeted quartz veining at approximately right angles, with the hole remaining within the confines of the host granitoid body to a down hole depth of 23 m.

Drilling Results from Trenches TKB006 and TKB010 Zones (12 Holes) - Zone 2 - Kibi Project
Seven out of the 12 remaining drill holes on Zone 2 were designed to better define gold mineralization at Trench TKB006 and Trench TKB010 zones identified during the initial scout Phase I Drill Program at the northwest extremity of Zone 2 of our Kibi Project; one hole targeted a new gold zone exposed in recent trenching (trenches TKB014E and TKB014F); two holes probed previously untested gold-in-soil anomalies and two holes tested an IP / Resistivity anomaly spatially associated with a gold-in-soil anomaly. In addition, a total of 960 linear meters of mechanized trenching (38 trenches) was also conducted on Zone 2 in conjunction with this drill program to better define the surface trace of the host granitoid bodies, to test strike extension of known mineralization and to test gold-in-soil anomalies and geophysical targets.
Five out of the above-noted seven holes targeting the Trench TKB006, TKB010 and TKB014E-TKB014F zones yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from one meter to 76 m in core length. As at October 28, 2009, mineralization identified by trenching and drilling, spread out over an approximately 975 m east-west distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil trend, appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence.
Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides.
Drilling highlights include granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut) including 10.0 m grading 33.15 g/t gold uncut (10.95 g/t gold cut) in drill hole KBRC09060 and 76.0 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 20.0 m grading 3.36 g/t gold (and including 5.25 g/t gold over 9.0 m) in hole KBRC09068. Significant gold intercepts for holes KBRC09057 to KBRC09068 are set forth in Table 4 hereunder.
- 25 -
Table 4: Significant Drill Intercepts - Kibi Project - Zone 2 - RC Holes KBRC09057 to KBRC09068
Holes KBRC09057, KBRC09059 to KBRC09061 and KBRC09065 further tested the Trench TKB006 gold zone situated in the north-central portion of the approximately 1,000 m long Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Additional mechanized trenching and geological mapping during this drilling campaign appears to indicate that the Trench TKB006 Zone is characterized by two, NNW-trending, approximately eight (8) m and 40 mwide, sill-like granitoid bodies lying approximately 25 m apart within a metasediment rock sequence. Hole KBRC09060 targeting an extensive system of NE to SE trending quartz veining developed within the wider, eastern granitoid body returned an intercept from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut), including 10.0 m grading 33.15 g/t gold uncut (10.95 g/t gold cut). Drilling, including initial scout drill hole KBD08005, which returned intercepts of 1.18 g/t gold over 17.0 m and 1.02 g/t gold over 15.0 m, has traced the Trench TKB006 gold zone mineralization over an approximately 160 m strike distance.

Hole KBRC09062, designed to undercut gold mineralization discovered by trenching of a previously untested gold-in-soil anomaly lying approximately 225 m west-northwest of the Trench TKB006 zone, yielded a granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercept of 4.03 g/t gold over 4.0 m, including one m grading 9.32 g/t gold. The two target trenches positioned end to end on the same soil geochemical anomaly line both returned significant channel sample intercepts separated by an approximately 20.5 m distance, including 8.49 g/t gold over a 5.0 m trench-length, including 2.0 m grading 14.85 g/t gold, in trench TKB014E and 6.86 g/t gold over an 8.0 m trench-length, including 1.0 m grading 22.4 g/t gold, in trench TKB014F. This new gold zone is considered especially interesting given the values defined at this early stage and the extent of the untested gold-in-soil anomalies present along lines 167N to L169N within the approximately 400 m gap between the Trench TKB006 and TKB010 zones.
Holes KBRC09067 and KBRC09068 further tested the Trench TKB010 gold zone located at the north-western extremity of the approximately 1,000 meter long Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Hole KBRC09068 targeting an extensive system of NE to NW trending quartz veining exposed in Trench TKB010 returned a granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercept from surface of 76.0 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 20.0 m grading 3.36 g/t gold (and including 5.25 g/t gold over 9.0 m). Drilling and trenching to date, including initial scout drill hole KBD08008, which returned an intercept of 1.01 g/t gold over 45.0 m (including 2.01 g/t gold over 12.0 m), have traced the Trench TKB010 gold zone mineralization over an approximately 150 meter distance along the inner, northern margin of an east to southeast trending granitoid body.
Results from 23 Scout RC Holes - Zone 3-- Kibi Project
Drilling highlights for Zone 3 include granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 30.0 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 14.0 m grading 6.47 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 8.0 m in hole KBRC09019; 4.0 m grading 4.86 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 26 m in hole KBRC09023 and 8.0 m grading 4.95 g/t gold, including 3.0 m grading 12.89 g/t gold, from surface in hole KBRC09024. Significant gold intercepts for holes KBRC09019 to KBRC09041 are set forth in Table 5 hereunder.
Similarly to Zone 2, all Zone 3 mineralization targets are near surface, remain open in all directions and offer potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth. The limited scout drilling returned several significant gold intercepts over an approximately 825.0 m E-W distance across Zone 3. Zone 2 and Zone 3 drilling has traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over an approximately 2,100 m distance along the NE-trending Kibi Gold Trend.
This initial Zone 3 scout drilling formed part of the 4,715 meter Phase II RC Drill Program which included 27 holes for 2,478 m on Zone 2 and 23 holes totaling 2,237 m on Zone 3; an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four extensive higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area. The present drilling was designed to undercut surface gold mineralization exposed in reconnaissance trenches, and to test geophysical Induced Polarization (“IP”) / Resistivity and /or gold-in-soil anomalies on Zone 3; an approximately 1,000 m by 100-500 m, gold-in-soil anomaly located approximately 700 m to the southwest of the main Zone 2 drilling area.

As at February 11, 2010, drilling included five holes to test the Trench TAD019 and TAD007 targets located at the southeastern extremity of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly, and 18 holes to assess the Trench TAD001 - TAD004, TAD015 - TAD021 and TAD016 targets within the north-central portion of the gold-in-soil anomaly. Fourteen out of the 23 scout holes returned significant gold intercepts, with an additional three holes yielding anomalous gold intercepts. (see QA-QC disclosure section for “Significant” and “Anomalous” intercept criteria). All mineralized intercepts consisted of granitoid-hosted and/or granitoid-associated gold mineralization, with mineralized material typically consisting of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides.
Hole KBRC09019 targeting an extensive system of granitoid-hosted, NE-trending, moderately NW-dipping, sheeted quartz veins discovered in Trench TAD019 returned a significant mineralized intercept of 30.0 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 14.0 m grading 6.47 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 8.0 m. For reference purposes, Trench TAD019 yielded a channel sample intercept of 4.93 g/t gold over 45.0 m, including 10.12 g/t gold over 12.0 m. Hole KBRC09039, representing the second hole of a scissor drill pattern designed to determine the dip attitude of the host granitoid body, returned an intercept of 39.80 g/t gold over 1.0 m from a quartz vein in mafic metavolcanic rock along the footwall flank of the granitoid body. Hole KBRC09020, targeting a zone of anomalous gold values in Trench TAD007 located approximately 65.0 m to the west of the KBRC09019 collar, yielded granitoid-hosted mineralization intercepts of 1.01 g/t gold over 3.0 m and 4.10 g/t gold over 2.0 m.
A total of 18 holes were drilled within the north-central portion of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly which is characterized by an approximately 800 meter long IP Chargeability anomaly exhibiting a spatial relationship with a geophysically inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend. Eleven of these holes tested the north-eastern, Moderate Chargeability / Very High Resistivity portion (200 m) of the IP anomaly exhibiting a coincidental gold-in-soil signature and anomalous trench results (i.e. Trench TAD001 - TAD004 Zone).
The limited, shallow RC drilling outlined an approximately 135.0 meter wide, NE-trending, granitoid hosted, structural corridor appearing to encompass at least five (5) distinct, gold-bearing, sheeted vein zones ranging from 1.0 m to 31.0 m in core length. Eight (8) out of the 11 Trench TAD001 - TAD004 Zone holes returned significant gold intercepts, including seven (7) holes yielding multiple significant and/or anomalous gold intercepts.
- 29 -
The mineralized structural corridor is characterized by significant gold intercepts over 1.0 m to 8.0 m core lengths occurring within more extensive, lower grade, mineralization envelopes attaining 15.0 m to 31.0 m in core length. Holes KBRC09024 and KBRC0937, intersecting what appears to be the same sheeted vein zone approximately 35.0 m horizontally apart within the central section of the structural corridor returned mineralized intercepts of 8.0 m grading 4.95 g/t gold, including 3.0 m grading 12.89 g/t gold, and 28.0 m grading 0.87 g/t gold, respectively. Similarly, holes KBRC09023 and KBRC09038, drilled in a scissor pattern along the northern margin of the structural corridor, yielded 4.0 m grading 4.86 g/t gold and 31.0 m grading 0.57 g/t gold, respectively from intercepts located approximately 8.0 m horizontally apart along the same mineralized structure.
Thirteen out of the 18 holes described above were drilled on open ground along the northern flank of the Apapam Mining Lease (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease” for details of this mining lease), with the drill traces extending from approximately 50.0 m to 300.0 m outside the concession boundary, and two (2) additional holes straddle the concession boundary. Following the completion of a professional land survey, the approximately 1.42 sq km wedge of open ground lying between the Apapam Mining Lease and the Atewa Forest Reserve boundary was staked by us to cover the mineralization targets identified by the holes in question. The staking application was formally received by Mincom on November 19, 2009 and is currently being processed, thus securing our priority staking status, however, as at the date of this Report, the application is still pending and there is no absolute assurance that this parcel of ground will be granted to our company. Refer to Significant Intercept Table above for claim status of individual Zone 3 drill holes.
NI 43-101 Report
In July 2010, SEMS prepared an independent technical report (the “43-101 Report”) consistent with the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, Form 43-101F1 - Technical Report and Companion Policy 43-101 CP (“NI 43-101”) on our Kibi Project.
Detailed Structural Study of the Kibi Project
In February 2010, we engaged SRK to conduct a detailed structural study of our Kibi Project, including (i) conducting field and drill core investigations; (ii) assisting with the analysis of geological and structural data collected to date; and (iii) providing insights on the geological and structural controls on the distribution of the gold mineralization.
Phase III Drill Program
Based on the results of the 2009 Phase II Drill Program, we commenced and completed our follow-up Phase III Drill Program on our Kibi Project during the Fiscal Year to: (i) further test the dip and strike extensions of the gold mineralization zones identified in the Phase I and Phase II drill programs; and (ii) test IP / Resistivity anomalies spatially associated with the Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The Phase III Drill Program was implemented from July 2010 to December 15, 2010 by Burwash Drilling of Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada.
Results of Phase III Drill Program
Drilling highlights from the South Ridge Granitoid of Zone 2 include surface or near surface granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 19.5 m grading 1.52 g/t gold in drill hole #KBDD10085; 25.5 m grading 1.50 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10086 and 23 m grading 1.74 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10090. Hole #KBDD10091 encountered a 17.0 m intersection grading 2.42 g/t gold as noted in the following table. These holes yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from 2 m to 72 m in core length. Drilling and trenching traced an extensive system of en echelon extension vein arrays across an approximately 440 m distance along the SE-trending South Ridge Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite to tonalite composition. Additional trenching/drilling is required to further define the extent and strike length of the quartz vein arrays, the structural controls of the mineralization and the contacts of the host granitoid body.

Ongoing diamond drilling has significantly expanded known gold mineralization down dip on the Zone 2 - Central Granitoid at our Kibi Project. Three step-back holes (685 m) successfully expanded the gold mineralization to a down dip depth of up to approximately 115 m. Drilling highlights include classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 20 m grading 2.43 g/t gold in KBDD10099; 58 m grading 2.46 g/t gold, including 28 m grading 3.67 g/t gold, in KBDD10101; 27 m grading 1.98 g/t gold and 25 m grading 1.76 g/t gold in KBDD10103.
- 31 -
The above-noted drill holes targeted the depth potential of the gold mineralization along the southeast portion of the Central Granitoid body located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. All three holes were designed to test the down dip extension of gold mineralization along an approximately 100 m strike extension of the host granitoid body; with the drilling centered on a flexure or possible fold nose imparting a change from a northwesterly trend to an easterly trend to the moderate, northerly dipping granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite to tonalite composition.
Hole #KBDD10099 was drilled in a southwest direction on the NW-trending segment of the granitoid body. It was designed to undercut a mineralized intercept of 27.0 m grading 4.03 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10069 and yielded two significant mineralization intercepts located approximately 75 m down dip of the #KBDD10069 intercept, including: 20.0 metres grading 2.43 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 141 m; and 7.0 m grading 2.53 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 176 m. Significant mineralization was traced over an approximately 115 m down dip distance from surface on the KBDD10069 - KBDD10074 - KBDD10099 drill section.
Hole #KBDD10101, consisting of a south trending borehole designed to test the nose of the flexure in the granitoid body at depth below an intercept of 25.4 m grading 2.11 g/t gold yielded by scout diamond core hole #KBD08012, returned a wide mineralized intercept of 58.0 m grading 2.46 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 112 m; approximately 45 m down dip of the #KBD08012 intercept. This 58 m mineralized intercept encompasses an essentially barren, 11.0 m core-length interval (130 m -141 m) appearing to reflect the truncation of the mineralization by a post mineralization dyke; with the mineralized section above the dyke yielding an intercept of 18.0 m grading 2.18 g/t gold (112 m - 130 m), and the segment below the dyke returning 28.0 m grading 3.67 g/t gold (142 m - 170 m), including 15 m grading 5.42 g/t gold. Hole #KBDD10103, also consisting of a south trending borehole collared approximately 50 m to the east of hole #KBDD10101 along the northern, hanging wall flank of the easterly trending granitoid body, was designed to undercut intercepts of 15.0 m grading 0.87 g/t gold and 33 m grading 1.28 g/t yielded by scout diamond core hole #KBD08013. Hole #KBDD10103 returned two significant mineralization intercepts extending approximately 45 m to 75 m down dip from the lower #KBD08013 mineralized intercept, including: 27.0 m grading 1.98 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 131.0 m, including 15.0 m grading 3.23 g/t gold; and 25.0 m grading 1.76 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 180.0 m.
- 32 -
Drilling and trenching traced significant gold mineralization within the southeastern segment of the Central Granitoid over an approximately 300 m strike extension of the host granitoid body and down to a maximum down dip distance 115 m. The mineralization remains open in all directions and drilling to further define the extent and geological controls of the mineralization is currently ongoing.
Gold Intercept Reporting Criteria
Unless otherwise indicated, “Reported Intercepts” represent core-lengths; true width of mineralization is unknown at this time. Individual sample results were length weighted to yield average composite interval grades as reported. “Significant Intercepts” satisfy following criteria: greater than (>) 5.0 gram gold x meter product and > 0.5 g/t gold. “Anomalous” signifies at least one intercept > 2.0 gram gold x meter product and >0.25 g/t gold. Intersections are constrained with a 0.25 g/t gold minimum cut-off grade at the top and bottom of the intercept, with a 50 g/t upper cut-off grade applied, and a maximum of five consecutive meters of internal dilution (less than 0.25 g/t gold). All internal intervals yielding above 10 g/t gold are indicated within the intersection.
Quality-Control Program
We have implemented a quality-control program to ensure best practice in the sampling and analysis of the drill core, RC samples and trench channel samples. Drill core is HQ diameter (63.5 mm) in upper oxidized material (regolith) and NQ diameter (47.6 mm) in the lower fresh rock portion of the hole. Drill core is saw cut and half the core is sampled in standard intervals. The remaining half of core is stored in a secure location. RC samples are taken at one meter intervals under dry drilling conditions by experienced geologists, with all samples weighed on site. Trench samples consist of continuous, horizontal channels collected from a canal excavated along the bottom sidewall of the trench (~ 0.10 meter above floor). All samples are transported in security-sealed bags to the ALS Chemex Laboratory (“ALS Chemex”) in Kumasi, Ghana. ALS Chemex is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory. A one kg split of the sample is pulverized to better than 85% passing 75 microns, and analyzed by industry standard 50 gram fire assay fusion with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish; with gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 10 g/t gold. Our company inserts a certified reference standard (low to high grade), analytical blank, and field duplicate sample in every batch of 20 drill core / RC chip / trench channel samples. Validation parameters are established in the database to ensure quality control.
Work in Progress
2011 Drill Program
On January 15, 2011, we commenced our 2011 Drill Program on our Kibi Project. The drilling was primarily designed to expand known gold mineralization along strike and at depth within the southeast portion of the Central Granitoid body located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. The drilling yielded widespread visible gold occurrences distributed over an approximately 250 m strike extension of the host Granitoid body, and down to a vertical depth of approximately 220 m.
Future Exploration Plans
We plan to continue our 2011 Drill Program throughout 2011 at an estimated cost of $5,000,000.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Kibi Project.
Apapam Mining Lease
XG Mining’s interest in the Kibi Project was previously held by a prospecting license granted by the Government of Ghana on March 29, 2004 covering a licensed area of 33.65 sq km. Subsequently, in May 2008, XG Mining made an application to the Government of Ghana to convert the prospecting license to a mining lease. Our application received parliamentary approval resulting in the Government of Ghana granting and registering the Apapam Mining Lease to XG Mining on the following terms and conditions.

Kwabeng Project
Overview
Our Kwabeng Project (also referred to as the “Kwabeng Concession”) is comprised of 44.76 sq km and our company’s interest in the Kwabeng Concession is secured by the Kwabeng Mining Lease controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; with the remaining 10% interest held by the Government of Ghana (see “Kwabeng Project - Kwabeng Mining Lease”).
Location and Access
The Kwabeng Concession is located in the East Akim District of the Eastern Region of the Republic of Ghana, along the western, lower flank and base of the Atewa Range, approximately 8.5 km north-northwest of our Kibi Project which is located on the Apapam Concession. The eastern boundary of the Kwabeng Concession is demarcated by the Atewa Forest Reserve.
Access to our Kwabeng Project can be gained by driving northwest from the City of Accra on the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road, which is the main paved national highway, for approximately 110 km until arrival at Anyinam. Make a left hand turn at the road sign that reads “Kwabeng” in the middle of the Town of Anyinam and drive in a southwesterly direction approximately 10 km until arrival at a sign reading “Xtra-Gold Mining” before reaching the town of Kwabeng.
Historical Work
There has been very little exploration for lode source gold deposits at our Kwabeng and Pameng Projects; however, there has been detailed exploration for placer gold deposits. Our Kibi, Kwabeng and Pameng Projects contain approximately 12,583,000 bank cubic meters (“BCM”) with an average grade of 0.568 grams of gold/BCM. In addition to the mineralized material, there is potential to define reserves with further exploration.
The placer gold deposit currently located at our Kwabeng Concession was mined by the former owner in the early 1990’s for 15 months and produced approximately 16,800 ounces of gold before operations were ceased due to mining difficulties as noted hereunder. The placer gold is contained in a gravel deposit distributed across the floor of the river valleys west of the Atewa Range which can easily be excavated.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for any exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
2008 to 2010 Exploration Programs
Except for the Bulk Test noted under “Recovery and Sale of Placer Gold”, no work program was carried out by our company on the Kwabeng Concession during 2008 and 2009. No significant work was carried out by our company on this concession in 2010.
Future Exploration Plans
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date. A work program to further evaluate the Kwabeng Old Mine prospect is currently under consideration for 2011.
Recovery and Sale of Placer Gold
In January 2007, we commenced an early stage pre-production mining process whereby a sample area of ore was processed, the results of which assisted us in determining the best way and most profitable manner in which to mine the placer gold to be recovered from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project. The foregoing process was internally referred to by our company as a “Bulk Test”. We tested 32,906.70 BCM of mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project that we processed through our floating placer gold washing processing plant and recovered 608.50 ounces of placer gold. Following completion of the Bulk Test, our company made modifications to our Wash Plant. We recovered placer gold from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project since January 19, 2007. In October 2008, we temporarily suspended our operations at the Kwabeng Project while management of our company considered a more economic and efficient manner in which to extract and process the placer gold recovered from the mineralized material at this Project. As at December 31, 2010, we have sold an aggregate of 8,814.82 ounces of placer gold recovered from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project, however we did not conduct any recovery of placer gold operations at this Project during the Fiscal Year. We did not have an exclusive agreement with any company or entity to buy the placer gold that we recovered.
- 35 -
Resumption of Recovery of Placer Gold Operations at our Kwabeng Project
We do not plan to resume recovery of placer gold operations at our Kwabeng Project. As stated elsewhere in this Report, we plan to focus our efforts and our financial resources primarily on planned exploration activities on our Kibi Project. In particular, as of the date of this Report, we have been conducting our 2011 Drill Program at our Kibi Project (see “Kibi Project - 2011 Drill Program”) since January 15, 2011. With respect to any mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project, we plan to enter into negotiations with independent Ghanaian contract miners and operators to assume such operations at this Project on fixed payment terms to our company. Also, the current gold price (approximately $1,417 per ounce) is significantly greater compared to the gold price during the previous mining effort by the former operator of this Project (approximately $300 per ounce). On the basis of an annual recovery of placer gold of approximately 360,000 BCM, we anticipate that recovery of placer gold operations at this Project could be sustained for 20 years, however, this will depend upon numerous factors including the grade and commercial recoverability of the mineralized material and the selling gold price at the relevant time.
Former Ownership
In the early 1990’s, the former mining lessee invested approximately $24,000,000 to open and operate a mine at the Kwabeng concession. The mining operation lasted for 15 months and 16,800 ounces of gold was produced before the mine was shut down due to a poor gold price, mining methodology and a lack of funds to continue mining operations.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Kibi Project.
Kwabeng Mining Lease
Our subsidiary, XG Mining, which is owned by us as to a 90% interest, entered into the Kwabeng Mining Lease on July 26, 1989 with the Government of Ghana, which holds a 10% interest in XG Mining. The Kwabeng Mining Lease covers an area of 44.76 sq km (the “Kwabeng Lease Area”). The Kwabeng Mining Lease has a 30 year term expiring on July 26, 2019. We have been granted surface and mining rights by the Government of Ghana to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area (including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials). With respect to the Kwabeng Mining Lease, we are: (i) required to pay applicable taxes and annual rental fees of approximately $15 to the Government of Ghana; and (ii) committed to pay a royalty in each quarter through the Commissioner of Internal Revenue based on the production for that quarter within 30 days from the quarter end as well as a royalty on all timber felled in accordance with existing legislation.

We purchase spare parts for all of our equipment either locally or from suppliers overseas and store such parts in the secure spare parts warehouse located at our Field Camp.
Workspace
There is adequate office space at our Field Camp to accommodate our administrative, geology, surveying, equipment maintenance and other departments, as well as their technical support and our laborers.
Equipment Purchases
During the Fiscal Year, we purchased a bulldozer, an excavator, a Mack truck and a lowboy trailer to assist us with our exploration activities. During the next 12 months, we plan on purchasing another bulldozer and excavator to assist us with our exploration activities. In addition, in connection with our exploration activities at our Projects, we own the equipment necessary to carry out such activities, except for a drill rig which we plan to rent.
Equipment Maintenance
Any maintenance of our excavator, or other equipment which we may own, will be carried out in the workshops located within our Field Camp.
Capital Expenditures
We do not anticipate any significant capital expenditures in the next 12 months in connection with recovery of placer gold operations as we have not planned to conduct such operations during this period. As stated elsewhere in this Report, we plan to negotiate with independent Ghanaian contract miners and operators to resume such operations.
Pameng Project
Overview
Our Pameng Project (also referred to as the “Pameng Concession”) is comprised of 40.51 sq km and our company’s interest is secured by the Pameng Mining Lease controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; with the remaining 10% interest held by the Government of Ghana (see “Pameng Project - Pameng Mining Lease”).
- 37 -
The Pameng Concession is located in the East Akim District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, along the western, lower flank and base of the Atewa Range, approximately 2 km west-northwest of our Kibi Project which is located on the Apapam Concession. Access to our Pameng Project can be gained by driving northwest from the City of Accra on the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road, which is the main paved national highway, for approximately 125 km until arrival at the village of Pameng where there is a road sign reading “Pameng”. Make a left hand turn at the Pameng sign and drive southwest approximately 2 km to reach our Pameng Concession. Our Pameng Concession is located approximately 15 km south-southwest from our Field Camp.
Historical Work
To the best of our company’s knowledge, the Pameng Concession has never been subjected to modern, systematic exploration for lode gold mineralization.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
General
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
2008 to 2010 Exploration Programs
No significant work program was carried out in 2008 through to 2009. Lode gold exploration efforts to date by our company on our Pameng Project have been limited to a few reconnaissance geology/prospecting traverses. No significant lode gold exploration work was conducted in 2010 on this Project.
Future Exploration Plans
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date. A first pass work program including soil geochemistry and scout trenching is currently under consideration for 2011.
Recovery and Sale of Place Gold
During the Fiscal Year, we negotiated with independent Ghanaian contract miners and operators in connection with their recovery of placer gold operations on fixed payment terms to our company.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Pameng Project.
Pameng Mining Lease
Our subsidiary, XG Mining, which is owned by us as to a 90% interest, entered into the Pameng Mining Lease on July 26, 1989 with the Government of Ghana, which holds a 10% interest in XG Mining. The Pameng Mining Lease covers an area of 40.51 sq km (the “Pameng Lease Area”). The Pameng Mining Lease has a 30 year term expiring on July 26, 2019. We have been granted surface and mining rights by the Government of Ghana to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area (including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials). See “Kwabeng Project - Mining Lease” for identical terms for the Pameng Mining Lease, except for the name of the mining lease and the lease area.
Banso Project
Overview
Our Banso Project (also referred to as the “Banso Concession”) is comprised of 55.28 sq km and, as at the end of the Fiscal Year, our company’s interest was secured by a single prospecting license (the “Banso and Muoso PL”) registered to XGEL covering the Banso Concession and the Muoso Concession. We subsequently converted the Banso and Muoso PL and, in January 2011, XG Mining was granted a mining lease covering the Banso Concession (the “Banso Mining Lease”).
Location and Access
The Banso Concession is located in the East Akim District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 11 km south-southeast from our Field Camp.
- 38 -
Both of the Banso Concession and the Muoso Concession lie in the Kibi-Winneba Gold Belt on the western flanks of the prominent Atewa Range, which is underlain by Birimian greenstone, phyllites, meta-tuffs, epi-diorite, meta-greywacke and chert. The valleys, over which this concession isare located, are underlain by thick sequences of Birimian metasediments. The north-western end of the Atewa Range is the type-locality for the Birimian metasediments and metavolcanics. The area where both of our Banso and Muoso Projects are located is one of the oldest placer gold mining areas of Ghana, dating back many centuries.
Access to the Banso Concession is gained by driving northwest approximately 136 km from Accra on the paved Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road.
Historic Work
Historical exploration and mining has mainly focused on placer gold. Prior to the acquisition of our interest in the Banso Concession, to the best of our knowledge and based on mining records in Ghana, there has never been a detailed documented bedrock exploration program conducted on this concession.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
General
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
All gold results for the following exploration programs are reported in “ppm Au” (part per million gold). The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
2008 to 2010 Exploration Programs
Our Banso Project is at an early stage of evaluation and no mineralized material or reserve estimates have been made. Prior to the period covered by this Report, we had completed preliminary lode gold exploration programs including grid establishment, soil sampling, prospecting/geological mapping, pitting/trenching and geophysics, aimed at identifying lode gold (hardrock) mineral occurrences at our Banso Project, the results of which are noted hereunder.
Banso Target Follow Up Program
Exploration work on the Banso Concession during 2008 was aimed at advancing the lode gold targets produced by the Phase I (2005) and Phase II (2006) work programs. Work focused on the further evaluation of the Banso Area 3 and Ankaase gold-in-soil anomalies located at the southern extremity of the Banso Concession.
The Banso Concession was subjected to manual trenching and soil geochemistry on an intermittent basis from late November 2007 to May 2008. All geotechnical field work such as mapping and sampling was conducted in-house by XGEL personnel. Grid establishment (line cutting) and manual trench excavation was conducted on a contract basis by Amofah and Associates of Accra and Andaco Enterprises Limited of Kwabeng, respectively.
Banso Area 3 Trenching
Three hand-dug trenches totaling 138 m were excavated on the Banso Area 3 gold-in-soil anomaly located at the southeastern extremity of the Banso Concession. Trenches Nos. TAB001 to TAB003 were excavated in a north-south direction, across the Phase II (2006) trenching located along the L1400N gold-in-soil anomaly, to test the subsurface expression of an extensive ENE-trending quartz float train discovered during prospecting. Trenches TAB002 and TAB003 form a continuous trench extending over a 112 m length. A total of 69 horizontal channel samples were collected at two (2) meter intervals, with shorter samples utilized in areas of geological interest (i.e. quartz veining).
Trenches TAB002 - TAB003 exposed a system of intermittent, ENE-trending, quartz veining extending over a 80 meter trench-length, including a 10 meter zone encompassing three parallel quartz veins ranging from 0.25 m to 0.35 m in width, within the northern portion of TAB002. Two of the quartz veins yielded significant gold values of 4.64 ppm and 7.67 ppm over true-widths of 0.25 m and 0.28 m, respectively. The TAB002-TAB003 trench yielded intermittent, anomalous gold values over its entire 112 meter length. Including exploration significant intervals of 0.19 ppm gold over 46 m and 0.22 ppm gold over 16 m.
- 39 -
Banso Area 3 Soil Sampling
The Banso Area 3 gold-in-soil anomaly was covered by a new, detailed (100 m), north-south oriented, soil geochemistry grid designed to better define the ENE-trending, gold-bearing quartz vein system discovered in trenches TAB002 and TAB003. A total of 460 soil samples were collected at 25 meter intervals along the 12.625 line-kilometers of cross lines. Including the Regional Exploration (2004) and Phase II (2005) work programs a total of 1,702 soil samples have been collected on the Banso Area 3 grid.
The anomalous threshold for the soil sample results was set at 0.05 ppm gold based on past work experience in the Kibi Gold Belt. 205 (12%) out of the 1,702 soil samples returned gold values greater than the 0.05 ppm anomalous threshold, including: 43 (2.5%) samples over 0.25 ppm; 22 (1.3%) samples over 0.50 ppm; and 14 (0.8%) samples over 1.0 ppm gold.
The combined soil geochemistry surveys outlined three parallel, ENE-trending, gold-in-soil anomalous trends across a 600 meter distance. The gold-in-soil anomalies (> 0.05 ppm Au), ranging from 50 meter to 150 meter in width, tend to be patchy in nature and / or pinch-out along their 600 meter to 1,500 meter trend-extents. The northernmost anomalous trend exhibits a good correlation with the quartz vein system identified in trenches TAB002-TAB003.
Exploration Program
No significant lode gold exploration work was conducted in 2010 on our Banso Project.
Future Exploration Plans
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Banso Project.
Banso Mining Lease
Our company’s interest in the Banso Project was previously held by a prospecting license granted by the Government of Ghana on September 24, 2011 covering a licensed area of 51.67 sq km. This prospecting license also covered a licensed area of 55.65 with respect to our company’s interest in our Muoso Project (see “Muoso Project - Muoso Mining Lease”). Subsequently, in the Fiscal Year, XG Mining made an application to the Government of Ghana to convert the Banso and Muoso PL to a mining lease. Our application received parliamentary approval resulting in the Government of Ghana granting and registering the Banso Mining Lease to XG Mining on the following terms and conditions.
The Banso Mining Lease is dated January 6, 2011 and is controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; with the remaining 10% interest held by the Government of Ghana. The Banso Mining Lease covers an area of 51.67 sq km (the “Banso Lease Area”). The Banso Mining Lease has a 13 year term expiring on January 5, 2024. We have been granted surface and mining rights by the Government of Ghana to work, develop and produce gold in the Banso Lease Area (including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials). With respect to the Banso Mining Lease, we are: (i) required to pay applicable taxes and annual rental fees of approximately (GH¢260.00 (USD$167) to the Government of Ghana; and (ii) committed to pay a royalty in each quarter through the Commissioner of Internal Revenue based on the production for that quarter within 30 days from the quarter end as well as a royalty on all timber felled in accordance with existing legislation. Under the terms and conditions of the Banso Mining Lease, we are required to (i) commence commercial production of gold within two (2) years from the date of this mining lease; (ii) furnish to the Government Authorities, MLFM, HIDMC and DGGS (i) a report in each quarter not later than 30 days after the quarter end in connection with quantities of gold won, quantities sold, revenue received and royalties payable for that quarter; (ii) a report half-yearly not later than 40 days after the half year end to the Government Authorities summarizing the results of operations in the Banso Lease Area during the half year and the Technical Records to be maintained by the company as particularly set forth in the Banso Mining Leases, which report shall further contain a description for any geological or geophysical work carried out by the company during that half year and a plan upon a scale approved by HIDMC showing mine workings and dredging areas; (iii) a report not later than 60 days after the end of each financial year to the Government Authorities (except for DGGS) summarizing the results of our operations in the Banso Lease Area during that financial year and the Technical Records, which report shall further contain a description of the proposed operations for the following year with an estimate of the production and revenue to be obtained; (iv) a report not later than three months after the expiration or termination of the Banso Mining Lease, to the Government Authorities, giving an account of the geology of the Banso Lease Area including the stratigraphic and structural conditions and a geological map on a scale prescribed in the Mining Regulations; (v) a report to the Government Authorities (except for HIDMC and DGGS) of any proposed alteration to its regulations and a report of the particulars of any proposed transfer of any share of its capital stock representing 1% of more of the total number of issued and outstanding shares; (vi) a report to the Government Authorities on the particulars of any fresh share issuance or borrowings in excess of an amount equal to the stated capital of XG Mining; and (vii) having regard to items (v) and (vi), these reports shall be submitted not less than 60 days in advance of the proposed alteration, transfer, issue or borrowing; (viii) a copy of XG Mining’s annual financial reports including a balance sheet, profit and loss account and notes thereto certified by a qualified accountant who is a member of the Ghana Institute of Chartered Accountants not later than 180 days after the financial year end to the Government Authorities (except for HIDMC and DGGS); and (ix) such other reports and information in connection with our operations to the Government Authorities as they may reasonably require. We are entitled to surrender all or any part of our interest in the Banso Lease Area upon providing proper notice to the Government of Ghana. We have the right to terminate our interest in the Banso Mining Lease if the subject mine can no longer be economically worked, by giving not less than nine months’ notice to the Government Authorities, without prejudice to any obligation or liability incurred prior to such termination. The Government of Ghana has the right to terminate our interest in the Banso Mining Lease if (i) we fail to make payments when due; (ii) contravene or fail to comply with terms and conditions of this mining lease (however, we have three months to remedy from the notice of such event); (iii) become insolvent or commit an act of bankruptcy; or (iv) submit false statements to the Government Authorities.

The Banso Mining Lease further provides that XG Mining shall report forthwith to the Government Authorities in the event we discover any other minerals in the Banso Lease Area, who in turn will provide XG Mining with the first option to prospect further and to work the said minerals subject to satisfactory arrangements made between XG Mining and the Government Authorities.
Muoso Project
Overview
Location and Access
Our Muoso Project (also referred to as the “Muoso Concession”) is comprised of 55.28 sq km and, as at the end of the Fiscal Year, our company’s interest was secured by the Banso and Muoso PL registered to XGEL covering the Banso and Muoso Concessions. We subsequently converted the Banso and Muoso PL and, in January 2011, XG Mining was granted a mining lease covering the Muoso Concession (the “Muoso Mining Lease”).
Location and Access
The Muoso Concession is located in the East Akim District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 10 km south-southeast from our Field Camp.
Access to our Muoso Project is gained by driving northwest approximately 80 km from Accra on the paved Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road. This highway passes through the easternmost portion of the Muoso Concession and shares a common boundary with the Kwabeng Concession. From the town of Osino, one would drive northwest approximately 5 km to the town of Anyinam, from which an all weather direct road heads south through the centre of the Muoso Concession and onto the Banso Concession, approximately 15 km south of the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road. The town of Muoso is approximately 10 km from Anyinam. A number of dirt roads, trails and footpaths offer additional access to this concession.
Historic Work
Historical exploration and mining has mainly focused on placer gold. Prior to the acquisition of our interest in the Muoso Concession, to the best of our knowledge and based on mining records in Ghana, there has never been a detailed documented bedrock exploration program conducted on this concession.

2008 to 2010 Exploration Programs
Our Muoso Project is at an early stage of evaluation and no mineralized material or reserve estimates have been made.
Muoso Target Follow Up Program
Exploration work on the Banso and Muoso Concessions during the 2008 reporting period was aimed at advancing the lode gold targets produced by the Phase I (2005) and Phase II (2006) work programs. Work focused on the further evaluation of the Banso Area 3 and Ankaase gold-in-soil anomalies located at the southern extremity of the Banso Concession and eastern extremity of the Muoso Concessions, respectively.
Hand auger sampling and trenching programs were implemented at the Muoso Concession on an intermittent basis from February to November, 2008. All geotechnical field work such as mapping and sampling was conducted in-house by XGEL personnel. Grid establishment (line cutting) and manual trench excavation was conducted on a contract basis by Amofah and Associates of Accra and Andaco Enterprises Limited of Kwabeng, respectively.
and 2010 Trenching Program
From December 1, 2009 to February 20, 2010, we conducted a 546 linear-meters trenching program at our Muoso Project. Details of the trenching program are noted below under “Ankaase Trench 2009 Trenching Program”.
Ankaase Trend Auger Sampling
As a follow up to the Phase II (2006) soil geochemistry survey, a hand-auger program was implemented on the Ankaase gold-in-soil anomaly located at the eastern extremity of the Muoso Concession. The auger sampling was designed to test the geochemical signature of the gold-in-soil anomalies at depth within the saprolite horizon in order to better define trenching targets. A total of 99 sites, totaling 371 linear-meters, were augered to an average depth of approximately 3.75 m (5 m max.). A one (1) m sample was collected from the saprolite horizon at the bottom of each hole. Auger hole spacing was typically at 25 m, with some 12.5 meter infilling.
The anomalous threshold for the auger sample results was set at 0.10 ppm gold based on past work experience in the Kibi Belt. 21 (21%) out of the 99 auger samples returned gold values greater than the 0.10 ppm anomalous threshold; including four samples over 0.5 ppm and a maximum value of 2.46 ppm. The auger sampling proved to be an efficient trench target definition method.
Ankaase Trend 2008 Trenching Program
The 2008 scout trenching program encompassed 19 hand dug trenches, ranging from 8 m to 236 m in length and from 1.5 m to 3.5 m in depth, and totaling 805 linear meters. The reconnaissance trenching was designed to test the geochemical signature at depth, within the in situ saprolite (oxidized rock) horizon, of the southern half (1.4 km) of the extensive Ankaase Gold Trend; an over 3.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by the widespread occurrence of auriferous quartz floats.
This initial reconnaissance trenching program yielded very encouraging results and confirmed that the extensive Ankaase gold-in-soil trend is spatially associated with a typical “Ashanti” style shear zone setting developed proximal to a Birimian metavolcanic-metasediment contact with associated Belt granitoids.
A total of 511 horizontal channel samples were collected from a canal excavated along the bottom sidewall of the trench (~ 0.10m above floor). Samples were typically 2 m in length, with shorter (1 m) samples utilized in areas of geological interest (i.e. quartz veining). 85 (17%) out of the 511 channel samples returned gold values greater than 0.5 ppm, including: 52 (10%) samples over 1.0 ppm; and 20 (4%) samples over 3.0 ppm gold.
Nine (9) out of the 19 trenches yielded significant gold intercepts as presented in Table 8; with an additional seven (7) trenches yielding anomalous, exploration significant gold values; and three (3) trenches failing to return any anomalous gold values.

Table 8: Significant Trench Specifications - Ankaase Gold Trend
(1)
Reported intercepts are trench-lengths; true width of mineralization is unknown at this time.
(2)
The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t).
Note:
Trenches #TMU003, 011, 012, 013, 014, 017 and 108 yielded anomalous, exploration significant gold value. Trenches #TMU006, 007 and 009 yielded no anomalous gold values.
Trenching to date has intermittently traced an approximately 150 m to 200 m wide, NE-trending deformation zone over an approximately 1.4 km strike length. This structural corridor is characterized by several sub parallel, shear hosted, gold-bearing quartz vein zones ranging from less than 1 m to approximately 24 m in trench length; with individual quartz veins ranging from less than 1 cm to 5.5 m in trench length. A granitoid body exhibiting widespread, low grade gold mineralization (0.43 ppm gold over 62 m) exposed within trench TMU005 at the southwestern extremity of the Ankaase Gold Trend is also of significant exploration interest.
Ankaase Trend 2009-2010 Trenching Program
The 2009-2010 trenching program encompassed 12 hand dug trenches, ranging from 30 m to 68 m in length and from 1.2 m to 3.5 m in depth, and totaling 546.0 linear meters. This trenching program commenced on December 1, 2009 and was completed on February 20, 2010. By the end of 2009, five (5) trenches totaling approximately 208.0 m had been excavated and channel sampled. The reconnaissance follow-up trenching was designed to better define the structural controls of the mineralization identified during the initial 2008 scout trenching program.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Muoso Project.
Muoso Mining Lease
Our company’s interest in the Muoso Project was previously held by the Banso and Muoso PL granted by the Government of Ghana on September 24, 2011 covering a licensed area of 55.65 sq km with respect to this Project. The Banso and Muoso PL also covered a licensed area of 51.67 with respect to our company’s interest in our Banso Project (see “Banso Project - Banso Mining Lease”). Subsequently, in the Fiscal Year, XG Mining made an application to the Government of Ghana to convert the Banso and Muoso PL to a mining lease. Our application received parliamentary approval resulting in the Government of Ghana granting and registering the Muoso Mining Lease to XG Mining on the following terms and conditions.
The Muoso Mining Lease is dated January 6, 2011 and is controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; with the remaining 10% interest held by the Government of Ghana.

Our Edum Banso Project (also referred to as the “Edum Banso Concession”) is comprised of 20.60 sq km and lies at the southern extremity of the Ashanti gold belt in the Western Region of Ghana.
Location and Access
The Edum Banso Concession lies within the south Ashanti gold belt in the Western Region of Ghana and is located approximately 235 km west of Accra and 15 km northwest of Takoradi, the regional capital. The north-western extremity of this concession falls within the grounds of the Benso Oil Palm Plantation (BOPP).
Access to this Project is accessible via a secondary road from Apowa on the Takoradi to Tarkwa highway; with the all-season road dissecting the concession in a northerly direction through the hamlet of Edum Banso, located in the northern portion of the property. Our Edum Banso Project is located approximately 200 km southwest from our Field Camp.
Option Agreement for Prospecting License
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, XGEL entered into an option agreement dated October 17, 2005 (the “Adom Option Agreement”) with Adom Mining Ltd. (“Adom”), a 100% wholly registered Ghanaian company, who is the registered proprietor of a prospecting license which Adom entered into with The Government of Ghana on May 8, 1991, covering a licensed area of 20.60 sq km (the “Edum Banso Licensed Area”). The current term of the prospecting license expired on December 1, 2010 and a further one year renewal has been approved by Mincom. At the time of making our application for renewal of the prospecting license, as required by Mincom, we submitted (i) a comprehensive terminal report, including logs of pits and assay results; (ii) a detailed financial report; (iii) evidence of annual ground rent payments; and (iv) an environmental permit from the EPA.
Previously, Newmont Ghana Limited (“Newmont”) had entered into an option agreement with Adom in connection with the Edum Banso Project, however abandoned their interest.
Under the terms and conditions of the prospecting license, Adom has the right to prospect for and prove gold under or in the licensed area including the right to conduct such geological and geophysical investigations in the licensed area in order to determine an adequate quantity of geologically proven and mineable reserve of gold (directly or through agents, contractors or sub-contractors). Under the prospecting license, the holder has the right to (i) assign or mortgage its interest in the prospecting license, subject to obtaining the consent of the Government of Ghana who may impose certain conditions in connection therewith; (ii) surrender its interest in the prospecting license; and (iii) renew the term of the prospecting license for a period of two years or such other renewal period as may be granted in accordance with applicable mining laws of Ghana.
The Government of Ghana has the right to terminate the prospecting license in the event the holder of the prospecting license (i) fails to make payments when due; (ii) contravenes or fails to comply with terms and conditions of prospecting license; (iii) becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy; or (iv) submits false statements to the Government of Ghana. In any of the foregoing events, the holder will have 21 days in which to remedy any of these occurrences. If upon expiration of prospecting license, the holder has fulfilled its obligations and has established to the Government of Ghana that development of a mine from ore and reserves established within the licensed area is economical and financially feasible, the Government of Ghana shall grant the holder with first option to (i) acquire a license for purposes of mining gold in the licensed area of the Edum Banso concession; and (ii) participate in mining project in licensed area, subject to negotiation with the Government of Ghana of satisfactory terms for such license and participation.

Geology
The Edum Banso concession is underlain by basic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks, volcanoclastic rocks, greywackes and phyllites of the Upper Birimian Formation. These rocks are intruded by Dixcove suite granites in the north, mainly composed of hornblende granites, granodiorites, and gabbros and diorites in the south. Similar intrusive granites in Ghana have been proven to host disseminated sulphide hosted gold mineralization. Two major thrust faults interpreted from aeromagnetic data run north by northeast through the project area.
Historic Work
The only gold production on the concession was from local miners working the auriferous gravels and quartz veins as reported by J.W. Lunn in the 1930s. Amercosa (formerly AngloAmerican) reportedly worked on the project in the late 1990’s, however the results from this work are not published. St. Jude Resources, a Canadian public mining company, conducted geophysical surveys including magnetic and induced polarization surveys. The prospective structures identified in these surveys were followed up by geochemical surveys which included soil, trench and pit sampling.
Stream sediment sampling throughout the entire concession area by Newmont Mining in 2003 defined a broad anomalous gold zone approximately 7 km long by 1.5 km wide, roughly conforming to the regional geological trend. Follow-up soil (1,109 samples) and rock sampling by Newmont in 2004 further constrained this broadly anomalous area into two distinctive anomalies, while geophysical interpretation suggests they are coincident with the surface expression of two major North-South oriented thrust faults.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
2008 to 2010 Exploration Programs
Phase I Exploration Program
A first phase exploration program (the “Phase I Work Program”) was implemented on the Edum Banso concession from August 2007 to January 2008 by Torkornoo & Associates Limited (“TAL”), at a cost of approximately $177,000. TAL is a Ghanaian geological consultancy with the principal being a professional geologist registered with The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM).
Based on the complex structural nature of gold deposits identified to date by Third Parties within the Hwini-Butre/Benso-Subriso gold district, the Phase I Work Program encompassed infill soil sampling, reconnaissance geology / prospecting, hand auger sampling and trenching designed to identify cost-effective drill targets. The tighter soil geochemical coverage (200m) was implemented to better define the length-extents and trends of the gold-in-soil anomalies detected by the historical Newmont soil program (2004). The deep auger components of the program was proposed to test the geochemical signature of gold-in-soil anomalies at depth in order to better define trenching and drilling targets. The results of this program are noted hereunder.

Phase I fieldwork consisted of the following:
Grid establishment: 8.4 km baseline, 73.8 km gridlines;
Soil sampling: 2,703 samples collected, 1,815 samples submitted for gold analysis;
Rock sampling: 68 samples;
Hand auger sampling: 252 holes / samples;
Trenching: 6 trenches (319 m), 214 channel samples.
Soil / Rock Sampling; Methodology - Results
The first pass of the soil sampling survey was carried out using a classical digging tool called a “soso” to a typical depth 0.5 m. Infill sampling in areas of interest was implemented by shallow auger sampling to a 1.0 meter depth. A total 1,815 soil samples were submitted for gold analysis.
TAL arbitrarily set the anomalous threshold for the soil sample results at 0.05 ppm gold based on past work experience in the Hwini-Butre / Benso-Subriso gold district. 123 out of the 1,815 soil samples (approx. 7%) returned gold values greater than the 0.05 ppm anomalous threshold. The soil geochemistry survey outlined a 8.0 km long by approximately 0.6 km wide, gold-in-soil anomalous trend conforming to the regional NNE structural trend. This gold-in-soil anomaly (> 0.05 ppm Au) tends to be patchy in nature and / or to pinch-out along its 8.0 km extent. The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb). Four areas (i.e. Zone A, B, C and D) within the defined gold-in-soil anomalous corridor were relative continuity and / or the favorable geological and structural settings of the gold-in-soil anomalies.
Zone A, located to the north of the town of Edum Banso, extends from gridline 14700N to 15200N (500 m). Zone B, located to the northeast of the hamlet of Edum Dominase, extends from line 11300N to 12100N (800 m). Zone C is an approximately 200 m by 200 m area located in the east-central portion of the concession. This zone is characterized by three (3) consecutive, strongly anomalous gold-in-soil values over a 50 meter distance on Line 11300N. Zone D consists of a NE-trending zone of discrete gold-in-soil values extending from L8200N to L9900N (1,700 m) at the south-western extremity of the concession.
Based on geophysical interpretation, including airborne magnetic and radiometric data, the Zone C and Zone D gold-in-soil anomalies appear to be spatially associated with the contact between the Birimian Metavolcanics and the circular Mpohor Intrusive Complex.
A total of 68 rock (float) samples were collected during reconnaissance geological mapping carried out alongside the soil sampling. This rock sampling produced a single exploration-significant gold value from a float of iron oxide stained quartz located to the south of the Zone D gold-in-soil anomaly. Similarly to the Zone C and Zone D anomalies this anomalous quartz float also appears to lie proximate to the inferred metavolcanic-Mpohor Complex contact.
Deep Auger Sampling; Methodology - Results
As a follow up to the soil sampling a deep auger program was implemented on the four priority areas to test the geochemical signature of the gold-in-soil anomalies at depth within the saprolite horizon in order to better define trenching targets. A total of 252 sites were augered to an average depth of approximately 4.0 m with a one (1) meter sample collected from the saprolite horizon at the bottom of each hole. Auger hole spacing was typically 25 m, with some 12.5 meter infilling.
TAL set the anomalous threshold for the auger sample results at 0.10 ppm gold based on past work experience in the Hwini-Butre / Benso-Subriso gold district. 19 (7.5%) out of the 252 deep auger samples returned gold values greater than the 0.10 ppm anomalous threshold.
Manual Trenching; Methodology - Results
The Zone A and Zone D deep auger anomalies (> 0.10 ppm Au) were further tested by three (3) trenches totaling 160 m and three (3) trenches totaling 159 m, respectively. The trenches were manually excavated with pickaxes and shovels to a vertical depth of 4 m. A total of 214 channel samples were collected from the sidewall of the six (6) trenches totaling 319 m. Samples consisted of horizontal channels, typically 1 m or 2 m in length, cut approximately 0.1 m above the floor of the trench.

The Zone A trenching failed to yield any significant gold results. Trench EBTR005 yielded the only exploration - significant gold results from the Zone D trenching in the form of a length-weighted average grade of 1.23 ppm gold over a 4 meter trench-length (2 samples). The anomalous section is characterized by chlorite altered mafic metavolvanic rock hosting fine, iron oxide stained, quartz stringers.
Results / Recommendations
Although the Edum Banso Phase I Work Program only yielded limited exploration-significant gold results, the spatial association of the Zone C and Zone D gold-in-soil and deep auger anomalies, the anomalous trench EBTR005 channel samples, and the auriferous quartz float, with the geophysically interpreted, north-western rim of the Mpohor Intrusive Complex is of considerable exploration significance.
Economically significant gold mineralization is known to exist along the south-eastern margin of the circular Mpohor Complex, approximately 2 km to the south-east of the Edum Banso Concession. Although published information, geophysical interpretation, and the results of the present work program indicate that the Edum Banso Concession shares a similar geological / structural setting as the deposits located on the south-eastern rim of the Mpohor Complex, it by no means implies that our Edum Banso Project hosts similar mineral deposits.
Recommended work to further advance the project includes: (a) additional deep auger sampling of the Zone C and Zone D gold-in-soil anomalies; (b) continued reconnaissance geology and rock (float) sampling along the inferred margin of the Mpohor Complex; and (c) detail structural interpretation of the property area based on the airborne magnetic and radiometric data. No significant work was carried out by our company on this concession in 2010. Further exploration activities will be planned once an ongoing geological, geochemical and geophysical data compilation has been completed. As at the date of this Report, we have not planned to conduct any exploration activities on this project during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date.
Future Exploration Plans
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months. Our plan is to negotiate the sale of our interest in this Project.
Resources and Reserves
No ore resources or reserves have been identified on our Edum Banso Project.
