ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
ARI’s principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for ARI’s present operations.
Details of ARI’s and its subsidiaries’ real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2006, are set forth in SCHEDULES III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.” The discussions set forth below under the headings “Real Estate” and “Mortgage Loans” provide certain summary information concerning ARI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 2006, no single asset accounted for 10.0% or more of total assets. At December 31, 2006, 85.2% of ARI’s assets consisted of real estate, and 3.5% consisted of notes and interest receivable. The remaining 11.3% of ARI’s assets were cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities, restaurant equipment, investments in equity investees, goodwill and other intangibles, and other assets. The percentage of assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of ARI’s assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
ARI’s real estate is geographically diverse with concentrations in the Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest regions. At December 31, 2006, ARI’s real estate was located in all geographic regions of the continental United States, other than the Northeast region, as shown more specifically in the table under “Real Estate” below. ARI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southwest, Pacific, and Midwest regions of the continental United States. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of ARI’s notes receivable portfolio.
Real Estate
At December 31, 2006, 85.2% of ARI’s assets were invested in real estate and the equity securities of IORI and other equity investees. ARI invests in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or non-leveraged basis. ARI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, properties held for sale, investments in partnerships, and investments in equity investees.
Types of Real Estate Investments. ARI’s real estate consists of apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses, shopping centers, and a merchandise mart), hotels, and improved and
unimproved land. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age, and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values, and physical condition are among the factors considered. Properties may be purchased subject to debt, or existing debt may be assumed and properties may be mortgaged, pledged or otherwise collateralized to obtain financing. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although ARI has typically invested in developed real estate, it may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with unaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Board of Directors). To the extent that it invests in construction and development projects, such as the apartments described below, ARI is subject to business risks, which include cost overruns and construction delays, associated with higher risk projects.
At December 31, 2006, ARI had the following properties under construction.
In 2005, ARI completed the 70 unit Blue Lake Villas II in Waxahachie, Texas, the 272 unit Bluffs at Vista Ridge in Lewisville, Texas, the 232 unit Bridges on Kinsey in Tyler, Texas, the 208 unit Dakota Arms in Lubbock, Texas, the 240 unit Lake Forest in Houston, Texas, the 220 unit Wildflower Villas in Temple, Texas, the 398 unit Kingsland Ranch Apartments in Houston, Texas, the 240 unit Stonebridge at City Park Apartments in Houston, Texas, and the 240 unit Vistas of Vance Jackson in San Antonio, Texas.
The Company’s three office buildings in downtown New Orleans suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Management has worked with the Company’s insurance carriers to finalize all related claims. Repairs have nearly been completed for the Amoco and 1010 Common buildings. The building at 225 Baronne is not open and few repairs have been completed. ARI intends to redevelop 225 Baronne as an urban residential facility, which it considers the best and most profitable use of the property. In August 2006, to facilitate the marketability of the property, ARI acquired the Clarke Garage and 305 Baronne for approximately $14.0 million to provide additional parking and retail for the residential development.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of owned real estate (excluding 92 parcels of improved and unimproved land, a hotel in Wroclaw, Poland, and a single-family residence, described below) at December 31, 2006.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, amount of commercial square footage, and number of hotel rooms owned, and does not reflect the value of ARI’s investment in each region. See SCHEDULE III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of owned real estate.
Excluded from the table above are a 165 room hotel in Wroclaw, Poland, a single family residence in Dallas, Texas, and 92 parcels of improved and unimproved land. See “Land Properties” table below for a listing of properties, locations, and acres.
A summary of the activity in the owned real estate portfolio during 2006 is as follows:
Operating Properties. Set forth below are ARI’s operating properties and the monthly rental rate for apartments, the average annual rental rate for commercial properties, the average daily room rate and room revenue divided by total available rooms for hotels, and occupancy at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 for apartments and commercial properties and average occupancy during 2006, 2005, and 2004 for hotels.

Partnership Properties. ARI accounts for partnership properties using the equity method. ARI had no property information for properties owned by partnerships.
In December 2004, ARI sold to an unrelated investment group a 95% partnership interest in Garden Centura, L.P. that owns the 410,901 sq. ft. Centura Tower office building located in Farmers Branch, Texas. ARI retained a non-controlling 1% general partner and 4% limited partner interest in Garden Centura, L.P. ARI accounts for its investment in this partnership on the equity method.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of ARI’s assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, secured by income-producing real estate, unimproved land and partnership interests. Management expects the percentage of ARI’s assets invested in mortgage loans will decline, as ARI will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, ARI may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in the portfolio. Mortgage notes receivable consist primarily of first mortgage loans.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2006, consisted of four commercial buildings, unimproved land and partnership interests. The type of properties subject to mortgages in which ARI invests may be altered without a vote of stockholders.
As of December 31, 2006, the obligors on $43.8 million or 81.8% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of ARI. Also at that date, $2.9 million or 5.5% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio was non-performing.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage loan balance at December 31, 2006), by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as
collateral for ARI’s mortgage notes receivable. Excluded are $61.8 million of mortgage notes that are secured by unimproved land and other security, or are unsecured. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for additional details of ARI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2006 is as follows:
First Mortgage Loans. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan at or prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments, moderate or negative amortization of principal, or all interest and a “balloon” principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is ARI’s general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of ARI’s mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders. ARI may grant participations in first mortgage loans that it originates to other lenders.

In March 2005, ARI entered into an agreement to advance a third party $3.2 million for development costs relating to single-family residential lots in Austin, Texas. These advances are secured by stock in the borrower and hold a second lien on the undeveloped land. The secured note bears interest at 10 percent, requires semi-annual payments and matures in March 2008. In September 2005, the total amount authorized under this advance was increased to $5.0 million. As of March 31, 2006, ARI had advanced $3.2 million to the borrower.

This loan bears interest at 7.25% and matures in July 2012. Interest due to ARI will be deducted from the quarterly return owed by ARI to the Class A Limited Partners, eliminating the quarterly payments. In October 2005, ARI agreed to settle the remaining obligations under this loan by paying a lump sum of $425,000, making the total advanced $740,000. After January 2007, ARI may redeem the Class A Limited Partners interests in exchange for cancellation of both notes.

The financial institution has a Put Option that would require ARI to purchase both notes back under the following conditions: (1) failure to construct agreed upon roads on the property by December 2006 (the work is substantially complete); (2) there occurs any event of default by the buyer; (3) certain escrow deposits for the road completion are not sufficient to cover the cost of the road construction; (4) any amendment, modification or assignment of certain development and escrow agreements between ARI and the buyer; and (5) failure of ARI to deliver certain documents to the financial institution within a timely manner. ARI and other related parties have also guaranteed the full payment of the note balances, including any outstanding interest and costs incurred by the financial institution.
In December 2004, ARI sold the Centura Tower office building to a partnership and retained a 1% non-controlling general partner interest and a 4% limited partner interest. ARI has certain obligations to fund the partnership for rent abatements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other cash shortfalls. $4.1 million of these obligations were escrowed by ARI with the lender at loan closing. Through December 31, 2006, ARI has funded $6.5 million of these obligations, with $6.5 million recorded in the form of a note receivable from the partnership. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum. The note will be paid out of excess cash flow or from sales proceeds, but only after certain partner preferred returns are paid.
In August 2001, ARI agreed to loan Dallas Fund XVII LP up to $5.6 million secured by a second lien on an office building in Dallas, Texas.

As of the modified effective date, accrued interest of $582,000 was added to the principal balance of the note; the interest rate was fixed at nine percent per annum with all principal and interest due November 2005.
