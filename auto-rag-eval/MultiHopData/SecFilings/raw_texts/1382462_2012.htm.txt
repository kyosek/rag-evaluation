Mineral Properties
The Discovery Day Gold Property
On November 14, 2011, we entered into an asset sale agreement with Bowerman Holdings LLC to acquire up to 75% of 100% of Bowerman’s right, title and interest in and to 31 KM mining claims and 17 Raddlefinger mining claims located in Siskiyou County, California. This claim block contains 5 mines which comprised the historical Knownothing mining district and is now commonly known as the Discovery Day Gold Property. A Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report was written on the property in August 2009 and is available on our website.
Closing of the acquisition was scheduled to occur by May 12, 2012, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and is subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence by our company. On November 13, 2012, our company and Bowerman extended the closing date through May 31, 2013.
The Discovery Day mine was operational as recently as May 2010 and is fully permitted for gold production with the US Forest Service with all environmental impact studies completed and reclamation bonds posted. There are approximately 2,000 feet of underground workings on three levels with all utilities (air, water and power) in place and functional. Mine facilities include a miner’s dry with showers, mine office, supply house, compressor/generator building, repair shop, fuel storage and two explosives magazines. All underground mining equipment, surface support equipment, and mine vehicles necessary for mining are on site and operational.
The property includes a 20 worker man camp consisting of sleeping trailers, men’s and women’s restroom with showers, mechanics shop, fuel storage area, an administration building with a kitchen, lounge and two managerial offices, satellite television, internet and telephone, as well as integrated power and water systems. The property has a fully functional and permitted 100 ton per day gravity concentration processing mill which was last operated in October 2012. The mill site includes a lined water storage pond, two tailings ponds, a fully equipped assay laboratory and a gold smelting facility. Historical gold recoveries from the mill have reportedly averaged approximately 95%. With adequate mill feed, the Discovery Day Gold Property has the milling capacity to produce 25,000 ounces of gold per year.
Discovery Day Gold Property Plan of Operation
Under the asset purchase and joint venture agreements with Bowerman Holdings LLC, Del Toro is, in addition to other compensation, required to spend $1,500,000 on exploration, development and operating costs for the property as the earn in for the acquisition of its 60% equity in the property. The agreement outlines a work program focused on the two companies’ shared vision for the property. The three main goals of the work program are to:
1.
Put the mine back into commercial production. The mine was fully operational until underground activities were suspended by MSHA in May 2010. Prior to the suspension, two areas of the mine, the 400’ and 490’ raises were producing ore which, according to grab sample assays, averaged between .75 and 1.25 ounces per ton. Del Toro plans to re-commence mining in these two headings immediately after addressing the pending MSHA issues. Based on previous mining efforts these two headings are expected to provide a steady source of quality ore for the mill.
2.
Better define and develop the reserves and resources of the property. None of the 5 mines on the claims have ever been drilled and/or systematically studied so their ultimate potential remains unknown. Del Toro plans to design and initiate an extensive geological evaluation of the property including surveying, sampling and drilling. Success with this geologic program will provide a better understanding of all of the geologic structures and potentially develop additional sources of ore for the mill to increase production capabilities. This geologic work will be done concurrently with the production mining efforts.
3.
Acquire mining access to the major veins located on the property. An extensive surface survey was performed in early 2010 that indicated the end of the 400 cross cut in the lower Discovery Day workings is in close proximity to the prolific Gold Run and Hunter veins. These two veins reportedly produced over 50,000 ounces of gold from the Gilta mine. Historical maps and geologic reports show that these veins were never mined from the Discovery Day side of the mountain. Accessing these two veins via extending the underground drift at the Discovery Day mine will be a top priority for providing additional ore to the mill.
Technical Report
We received a technical report dated August 10, 2009 written by Jeffrey L. Wilson, P. Geol., with respect to the Discovery Day Gold Property. Pursuant to the report, Mr. Wilson recommended two phases of work for the Discovery Day Gold Property. The goal of the Phase 1 work program is to develop high-priority drill targets. Phase 1 work consists of surface geologic mapping and sampling with tight ground survey control. Underground mapping and sampling of historic workings should be considered where safe entry is possible. Estimated Phase 1 costs are $172,000 over a three to four month period in the event that we elect to proceed.
The Phase 2 work program is designed to drill test targets identified in Phase 1. Phase 2 consists of underground core drilling (3,000 ft) and surface core drilling (4,800 ft) at the Discovery Day mine and surface core drilling (10,000 ft) at the Hansen mine. Should we proceed with Phase 2, success at the Discovery Day mine would lead to developing near-term reserves for the mill. Success at the Hansen mine would develop a new source of ore immediately adjacent to the mill.
The Discovery Day Gold Property is a production-ready gold property in need of exploration and geological work to delineate near-term reserves. The property is fully permitted for production with attending underground mine, powder magazines, operational mill, support facilities, and underground and surface equipment. Exploration potential appears good to excellent to identify new mineralization and eventual reserves.
The Discovery Day Gold Property is located in the Salmon Mountains of northwestern California, approximately 60 miles southwest of Yreka. The property is approximately 950 acres and consists of 48 unpatented lode claims which encompass most of the Knownothing mining district. Property jurisdiction is under the USFS who is responsible for all operations in the Klamath National Forest. The claim block is owned and controlled 100% by Trinity Alps Resources, Inc. with a 2% NSR production royalty payable to Patrick Fagen, president of Trinity Alps Resources, Inc. Mr. Fagen is also an officer and director of our company.
The property is between 2,000 to 4,000 ft in elevation in steep and forested terrain. Access is good via paved and dirt roads. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 85 inches per year occurring mainly as rain. A 12-month operating season is possible with some down time for snow removal. A Decision Notice by the USFS in 1995 found no significant impact by the Discovery Day mine operations to any threatened, endangered, or sensitive plant or animal species.
Property Location and Description
The Discovery Day Gold Property consists of 48 contiguous unpatented federal lode mining claims covering approximately 950 acres in the Knownothing mining district, Siskiyou County, California. The Knownothing mining district is located in the Salmon Mountains within the Klamath National Forest at latitude 41°11'44"N longitude 123°19'27"W in Sections 1 and 12, T.9N., R.7E., and Sections 6 and 7, T.9N., R.8E., Humboldt Base and Meridian. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map datum is in NAD 27, UTM Zone 10. The claims are on both sides of the northeast-trending Bowerman ridge which form the divide between the North Fork of the Knownothing Creek drainage and the Granite Gulch Creek drainage on Bowerman Mountain. The property falls on the Youngs Peak, California 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle (2001 version, scale 1:24,000) with contour intervals of 80 ft. Elevations on the claim block range between 2,000 and 4,040 ft MSL. The property is approximately 60 miles southwest of Yreka, California and approximately eight (8) miles by road south of Forks of Salmon, California.
The 48 lode claims are located on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the USFS in the Klamath National Forest. Recording of mining claims and collection of annual claim maintenance fees is administered by the BLM. The Raddlefinger claims were purchased on January 9, 2006 for the sum of $1,200,000 from Lovelock 79.com Inc, a Nevada corporation by Discovery Day LLC, a private limited liability company organized in the State of Nevada, on December 26, 2003. All of the “KM” claims were staked by Discovery Day LLC and recorded on March 12, 2004. Trinity Alps Resources, Inc. purchased the entire block of 48 claims and all mining assets from Discovery Day LLC on July 24, 2009 for the price $1,475,000.

Accessibility
The Discovery Day Gold Property is accessed by traveling southwest from the town of Yreka on paved State Highway 3 approximately 68 miles to the small town of Forks of Salmon. Travel time by car in good weather is about 2 hours due to slow driving conditions caused by narrow lanes, many sharp curves, and steep grades. From Forks of Salmon, the property is reached in less than 30 minutes by traveling approximately 3 miles southeast on paved Cecilville Road to USFS Road 10N02 and thereafter traveling approximately 3 miles by one-lane dirt road to the Discovery Day mill (Star Hansen millsite) and an additional 1 mile to the Discovery Day man camp and mine. The access road is locally steep. A 4-wheel drive vehicle is necessary during the winter and spring seasons. The mine access road is capable of handling small trucks and equipment.
The town of Forks of Salmon, with a population of less than 40, is the nearest “town” with phone, fuel and mail service. The nearest large towns are Yreka and Eureka which are 2 to 3 hours travel time away. The city of Medford, Oregon is another 40 miles north of Yreka on Highway 5.
A helicopter pad has been developed at the Discovery Day site and there is a short landing strip for fixed wing aircraft in nearby Etna, California 40 miles to the east.
Climate and Operating Season
The Pacific coastal climate to the west of the property has a strong influence on the climate at the Discovery Day Gold Property. This coastal influence is moderated by the central Klamath Mountains located to the west of the property. Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and wet. Summer high temperatures are about 90° to >100° Fahrenheit (32° to > 38° C); low temperatures are about 55° Fahrenheit (13° C). Winter high temperatures are about 40° to 55° Fahrenheit (5° to 13° ) with rain and somewhat cooler under clear skies.
Mean annual precipitation in the Salmon River watershed ranges from about 35 inches to about 85 inches. Approximately 90% of the precipitation occurs from October to May from the north Pacific cyclonic storms. The remainder occurs during summer thunderstorms. The climate within much of the Klamath National Forest is influenced by elevation. Elevation on the claim block ranges between 2,000 ft and 4,041 ft, MSL. Winter precipitation occurs mainly as snow above 4,000 ft, and mainly as rain below 4,000 ft elevation.
A 12-month operating season is possible with the potential for down time for snow removal during the heaviest of snow events. Fluctuation of the snow level occasionally results in rain falling on snow, causing rapid snow melt. The southern exposure for the mine, man camp and mill site also facilitates the snow melt at these key operating points.
A Galion road grader is used to clear the mine road of snow and small slides. Based on actual operating experience, the most practical operating season is from March through November with a skeleton crew performing care and maintenance from December through February. With the mill facility being located at an elevation of 2550 ft, ore can be stockpiled for milling during the winter season, but road conditions make full scale winter operations at the site difficult.
Geology and Mineralization
Northwestern California is comprised of accreted terranes which form the Klamath Mountains geologic province. The Discovery Day Gold Property lies within Eastern Hayfork terrane of the Western Paleozoic and Triassic Belt. Rocks within this terrane are metamorphosed to greenschist facies and consist of a mélange of Triassic-Paleozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, and Jurassic ultramafic rocks. This package of rocks is intruded by the Youngs Peak pluton, a Jurassic dioritic intrusion. The Discovery Day claim block is located primarily on metasedimentary rocks and slightly overlaps the contact with the Youngs Peak pluton.
Metasedimentary rocks are comprised of carbonaceous argillite, chert, quartzite, chert-argillite breccia, and uncommon blocks of recrystallized limestone. Large portions of the metasedimentary section are chaotically mixed and deformed, representing Jurassic “mélange-style tectonic disruption.” Metavolcanic rocks consist of “greenstone” of original basaltic to andesitic composition. Ultramafic rocks are irregularly-shaped bodies of sheared serpentinized ultramafic rocks within the metasedimentary rock sequence. There is a consistent north-south trend of lithologic units with preferential bedding dips eastward. Local foliation is deflected by the Youngs Peak pluton.
Gold mineralization is present in a series of poorly exposed, sub parallel, narrow, mesothermal gold-quartz veins and fault gouge located adjacent and outward from the Youngs Peak pluton. Placer gold deposits are widespread in local drainages. Gold-quartz veins are typically narrow, ranging from 1 to 10 ft in thickness and commonly 1 to 4 ft in thickness. They are comprised of low-sulfide mixtures of white quartz, quartz boudins, irregular quartz stringers, and dark inclusions of pyritic country rock breccia fragments. The veins pinch and swell and may have sharp or diffuse contacts with country rock. Ultimate vein lengths are unknown but are likely greater than 1500 ft. Vein dips are typically southward and vary from 55° to 90°. Gold-bearing, low-angle structures are also present. Gold ores contain a sulfide suite comprised of dominant pyrite and smaller amounts of arsenopyrite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrotite. Sulfides are usually much less than 3%. Visible gold is locally present. Native gold has a tendency to be associated with galena as opposed to other sulfides. Minor silver-rich electrum is present. Liberated gold particles range from 22 to 450 microns. Ore grades range from 1 to 7 opt Au and are typically 1 to 3 opt Au. High-grade pockets of ore comprised of tens’ of ozs gold have been encountered. Silver is not an important credit. Historically, ore has been produced from over a vertical distance of 1500 ft. Individual ore shoots are highly variable and may pinch out horizontally in short distances. Shoots are reported from 25 ft to 100+ ft wide and may extend downward over 350 ft. Reliable information on the rake of gold mineralization is not available. Auriferous clay fault gouge containing greater than 1 opt Au has been reported mined from old workings.
Exploration and Mining History
More than 7 million ozs gold have been recovered from gold-quartz fissure veins and placer deposits in the Klamath Mountains province of California-Oregon. The first discovery of placer gold in the Knownothing district was made in 1850. Gold-quartz veins were later discovered in the Knownothing Creek drainage in the 1860’s with production underway by the 1870’s. Principal mines include the Gilta, Knownothing, and Star Hansen. Combined production from these mines was 60,430 ozs gold of which the Gilta mine produced 83%. Gold production extended into the 1930’s and minor work occurred in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. In 1986, lode claims were staked covering the old “Coldwater” mine workings in the Granite Gulch drainage, east of the Gilta mine. These workings have since been reconditioned and developed into what is now the Discovery Day mine.
Various owners have controlled the Discovery Day Gold Property. From 1986 to 2004, the property was controlled and operated by Wazco Inc., Heritage Mines Ltd., and Lovelock79.com. During this time, 1900 ft of underground development was completed with a reported 3,000 ozs gold produced. In 1996, 195 tons of ore was reportedly processed that averaged 12.06 opt Au, including 43 tons or ore containing 37.4 opt Au. A soil survey was conducted during this period in the vicinity of the Discovery Day mine. From 2004 to 2005, Discovery Day LLC controlled the property and reconditioned the mine and improved surface facilities. Discovery Day LLC entered into an installment purchase option with Merendon Mining (NV) Inc. in 2005. Merendon occupied the property and renovated the main camp area and upgraded the mine ventilation and water systems. Various underground mine developments were completed. No significant gold production was recorded. Seven surface core holes and five underground core holes were drilled. In 2008, Merendon defaulted on their purchase option and the property reverted back to Discovery Day LLC. Discovery Day LLC sold the mine and assets to Trinity Alps Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on July 24, 2009.
Drilling and Sampling
The only drill holes on the property are seven surface core holes (2,255 ft) and five underground drill holes (578 ft) drilled by Merendon Mining in 2005 and 2006. Surface drilling was conducted largely in front of the Discovery Day mine portal. Underground drilling focused on the Discovery Day vein on lower (haulage) level. Drill hole information is poor. One underground hole encountered significant gold mineralization where it penetrated the Discovery Day vein approximately 100 ft below the lower (haulage) level. The intercept is 3 ft grading 0.315 opt Au (not true thickness). No drilling has been conducted on the Gilta, Knownothing, and Hansen vein systems.
Hundreds of samples have been collected from the upper and lower levels of the Discovery Day mine and assay results are plotted on various maps. A soil sampling program was conducted in 1996 resulting in various gold-in-soil anomalies. Jeffrey L. Wilson, P. Geol., conducted verification of sampling in 2003 and 2009 with significant gold results. No quality control and assurance program has been utilized in regard to the mill site laboratory and past drill assays.
Metallurgical Testing
Gravity and flotation tests were conducted by McClelland Laboratories, Inc. in 1998 on two bulk samples from the lower and upper levels of the Discovery Day mine. The two bulk samples contained 2.334 opt Au and 0.314 opt Au, respectively. Tests on P80100 material had marginal results. Results from combined gravity and flotation tests on P80200 material had combined gold recoveries of 98.0% and 94.4%.
The Discovery Day mill presently operates with only a gravity circuit consisting of a ball mill, Deister Triple Deck 999 concentrating tables and a single-deck Deister cleaner table. Free gold recoveries are estimated at 70 to 80%. Gold recovery from sulfide concentrates is unknown.
Summary and Conclusions
Trinity Alps Resources, Inc. controls nearly the entire Knownothing gold district with no significant competitors. The property encompasses historic gold mines to include the Gilta, Knownothing, and Hansen mines. None of these old mines have been drilled. Most recently, the Discovery Day mine has been developed with modest production. Within the district, high-grade gold ore has been produced over a vertical distance of 1500 ft. Potential exists for 40 to 50 ore shoots per vein system with ore grading 1+ opt Au and local high-grade pockets containing 10 to 30+ opt Au. Additional parallel veins are highly probable. High-grade gold is exposed in the underground workings of the Discovery Day mine. This mineralization has not been drilled systematically. The Hansen mine has never been drilled and offers an attractive target immediately adjacent to the mill. Development of drill targets will require detail geologic mapping, sampling, and surveying of key mine workings. With adequate mill feed, the Discovery Day Gold Property has the milling capacity to produce25,000 opy gold.
The Natchez Pass Gold Property (a.k.a the “Nick” Mine)
On August 31, 2012, our company entered into a partial purchase option agreement with Natchez Pass LLC, as amended on September 27, 2012, to acquire up to a 67.5% interest, in leasehold interests to land in Pershing County, Nevada formerly known as the “Nick” mine.
The property is located in the Sierra Mining District within the Humboldt River Basin in northern Nevada . The geographical area is renowned for rich placer deposits. The 660 acre claim block is unpatented, located on BLM land, and consists of 25 lode claims and 8 placer claims. A unique and significant geologic characteristic of this mining property is that it contains both auriferous gravel channels (placer gold) as well as quartz anomalies with high grade ore shoots. However, very little substantiated geological information on the property is currently in hand.
Existing surface improvements on the property include a two acre millsite area with a fully equipped 250-400 yard per hour placer recovery circuit, 50,000 gallon water storage tank, three recirculation ponds, and a tool/parts inventory storage shed. The site has a good access road as well as on site work roads. Also on-site is a 1000 square foot, two bedroom house in good condition ideally suited for housing a security person, mine office, communications center and operations headquarters.
In addition to the surface placer development, subsurface lode development on the property is evidenced by at least 7 known adits. The full extent of the underground workings is unknown at this time as there is no known data on the location and length of all of the drifts. A survey and mapping program of the two main drifts was recently completed by Natchez Pass. Grab samples from some of the previously mined stopes have assayed in excess of 13 ounces per ton.
Natchez Pass ideally fits into our corporate strategy as it is fully permitted for placer production with the existing facilities facilitating a near term production placer mining operation. The mine was in placer operations as recently as 2010. The re-commencement of operations will require minimal repairs to the placer mill onsite, the purchase or lease of dirt moving equipment, and a new reclamation bond to replace the existing one posted with the BLM. The company is in the process of completing its due diligence and designing a testing program to better define the potential resource base.
Natchez Pass Plan of Operation
Pursuant to the terms of the amended partial purchase option agreement, our company intends to conduct its physical, on-site due diligence through Valley Excavating LLC, a Virginia domestic limited-liability company, that is in the business of providing excavation and related services on a contract basis.
Pending a successful outcome of the due diligence including a planned testing program, the mine will commence placer mining as soon as possible. The steps involved are as follows:
1. Consolidation and renewal of all existing operating permits under new operator and replace existing $165,000 reclamation bond.
2. Obtain all necessary insurances required to cover activities during this phase of the operation.
3. Obtain MSHA clearance and miner training.
4. Completion of site prep work to include building a fuel storage area, establishing utilities and communications, cleaning settlement ponds, and putting the water delivery system and storage tank on-line. Mill rehab work will include installing a new generator, wiring, motors and switches as well as a final concentrate recovery circuit.
5. A permit for the drilling of an on-site water well is being submitted and a well will be drilled upon approval to eliminate the need for the trucking of water to the site.
6. All dirt moving equipment for operations will be either purchased or leased and moved to the site.
7. Once the mill is operational, a crew is hired and trained, the site prep completed, and all equipment is on-site, the actual mining can commence. Two areas have been identified as initial mining targets based on surface reconnaissance. Additional testing and exploration will be in process concurrently with the mining efforts to provide geologic guidance for continued mining efforts.
Dos Naciones Property, Mexico
We own a 50% undivided interest in the Dos Naciones Property and have the option to acquire an additional 20% pursuant to the terms of our option agreement, as amended June 25, 2010 and October 21, 2010, with Yale Resources Ltd. The mineral concession that forms the Dos Naciones Property was staked by Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V. (Minera Alta Vista), a Mexican company that is a subsidiary of Yale Resources Ltd. Mineral concession Dos Naciones, number 230649, was registered September 28, 2007 and expires September 27, 2057. The concession is registered by the Government of Mexico in Book 366 Page 155 Act 309. This exploration concession covers an area of 2930.8269 ha, and is currently registered in the name of Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V. Title to the concession is currently held in the name of Minera Alta Vista, upon exercise of the option by our company, title to 70% of the concession will be transferred to our wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, Minera Plata Del Toro S.A. de C.V. The Dos Naciones mineral concession lies within the municipalities of Opodepe and Cucurpe, Sonora. Payments of 40,394.68 pesos are paid every semester, i.e., twice per year, to the Government of Mexico in order to maintain the rights to the mineral concession. This amount increases every two years. Our joint venture partner Yale Resources Ltd. has spent approximately $100,000 on property exploration to date.
Technical Report
We received a technical report dated March 25, 2009 from consulting geologist David J. Pawliuk, P. Geo, with respect to the Dos Naciones Property. Pursuant to the report, Mr. Pawliuk recommended a three phase exploration program on the Dos Naciones Property to explore potential mineralization on the property. The report found that Dos Naciones Property hosts different styles of metallic mineralization and that economic concentrations of silver and lead occur in quartz veins at both the Josefina and the Dos Naciones occurrence areas within the property.
The report also concluded that there were extensive areas of skarn occurring within the Dos Naciones Property at the La Espanola area, and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. These skarns contain potentially economic concentrations of copper, silver and gold. Skarns often form around the periphery of porphyry copper mineralizing systems. Lead and silver-bearing quartz veining occurs along a fault zone that strikes 130 degrees and dips 55 degrees to the northeast at the east side of the Dos Naciones occurrence area; this veining is approximately parallel to the mineralized quartz veins at Josefina. The report further concluded that the geological setting of the Dos Naciones Property area is favorable for bulk-tonnage porphyry copper deposits.
The report recommended a three phase exploration program on the Dos Naciones Property at an aggregate estimated cost of $450,000. The first phase of our exploration program consisted of detailed geological mapping, sampling, hand trenching and prospecting. In July 2010, our operator on the Dos Naciones Property engaged geological consultants to conduct mapping and sampling on the property. In October 2011, we commenced the second phase of our exploration program with a planned 300 meter 3-hole diamond drilling program. The drilling was successful in confirming the high potential for multiple at-surface skarn targets. Drilling in the strongly altered and fractured ground proved very difficult and each of the three holes was terminated before reaching the target depth due to technical reasons. The table below summarizes the results received:
The results of this second phase of our exploration program warrant the continuation into the third phase of the program. The timing and scale of the next phase of work has yet to be determined but our company is working with Yale to determine how best to advance the exploration at Dos Naciones. Our operations at Dos Naciones are currently on hold, subject to the development of the next drilling program and the availability of funds to proceed.
Description of Property, Location, Means and Access
The Dos Naciones Property is located approximately 140 km north northeast of the city of Hermosillo, in north-central Sonora, Mexico (See Figure 1 below). The Dos Naciones Property is located approximately 75 km southwest of the important Cananea mining district (Figure 1). The Dos Naciones Property is comprised of one mineral concession, or lode, that covers approximately 2,391 hectares. The Dos Naciones mineral concession measures approximately 5 km east-west by 5 km north-south; it surrounds the “CRUZ” concession, which covers an area of 100 hectares. The Dos Naciones Property is accessible via a gravel road that leads to Rancho Los Janos; this gravel road leads southward from the paved road between Magdalena de Kino and the village of Los Janos. The turnoff southwards to Rancho Los Janos is about 10 km east of the village of Cucurpe. Four-wheel-drive roads extend southwards beyond the ranch buildings and provide good access to all parts of the property. About 3 hours is required to drive from Hermosillo to the Dos Naciones Property.
There is a turf airstrip about 850 m long within the northeast corner of the concession area. However, this airstrip has been de-activated by erecting fence posts at intervals along the length of the airstrip, in order to prevent its use. There is an electrical powerline extending north from the village of Cucurpe to the Mina Santa Gertrudis, a former gold-producing mine located about 45 km north of the Dos Naciones Property. Cucurpe is about 20 km northwest of the Dos Naciones Property.
Figure 1 - Location of Dos Naciones Claim
Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The climate within the property area is semi-arid, typical of higher elevations in the Sonoran desert. Seasonal rains occur between April and July. The local ranchers have constructed dams along creek drainages within the property area, to collect runoff water for their livestock. Magdalena de Kino is the nearest community with fuel and full services. Magdalena de Kino is situated along the Pan-American Highway about 85 km south of the United States border at Nogales. The Dos Naciones Property area forms part of the Sierra El Jucaral, a north northwest trending mountain range on the western fringe of the Sierra Madre de Occidental. Elevations range between 1,140 and 1,690 m a.s.l. within the property area. The hillsides are moderately steep and thinly forested by scrub oak trees. Rock outcrop is exposed over about 10 to 20 per cent of the Dos Naciones Project property area.
North-central Sonora has undergone intermittent exploration since the time of the copper discoveries at Nacozari in 1660 and at Cananea in 1760 (Heylmun, 1996). Northern Sonora is one of the most important mining areas in Mexico. A variety of different types of mineral deposits have been mined within the region, including porphyry copper deposits at Cananea and Nacozari, Carlin-type gold deposits at Santa Gertrudis and Amelia, and gold-silver veins at Klondike and Las Chispas (Heylmun, 1996; Figure 1).
History of Exploration
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined in at least two places on the Dos Naciones Property, at Josefina and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. Historic workings on the Dos Naciones Property include pits and short adits excavated to extract copper from skarns. Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Dos Naciones occurrence area, in the southwest corner of the Dos Naciones Property. There is a 30 m deep shaft excavated within granitic intrusive rock at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. From the size of the mine dump piles, the writer estimates that at least 1,000 tonnes of vein material has been mined at Dos Naciones occurrence area. There has been limited historic mining of the copper- and iron-bearing skarns at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. One skarn body in this area extends across 100 m by 20 m, and the other skarn body is 180 m long by 75 m wide.
La Espanola area is on the eastern side of the Dos Naciones Property. Minera Alta Vista has determined that six drillholes have been completed in the La Espanola area. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these holes were drilled during the 1990’s by Penoles, the largest mining company in Mexico. The results of this drilling are currently being located as they have not been available to date.
The most recent known exploration work on the Dos Naciones Property was geological mapping and geochemical rock sampling by Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Yale Resources Ltd. The geochemical rock sampling was mainly done in areas of historic workings within the property area. Results of this work indicated that economic concentrations of silver and lead are present in quartz veins which occur at two places on the property.
Geological Setting and Mineralization
The economic mineralization encountered to date on the Dos Naciones Project property is quartz veins containing galena, silver and minor gold. In addition, skarn or calc-silicate rocks at Dos Naciones locally contain gold, silver and copper. Thus, there have been at least two episodes of gold and silver mineralization at the Dos Naciones Property.
The geological setting of the Dos Naciones Property is favourable for economic porphyry copper deposits. The Dos Naciones Project property area is within the Cananea district of northern Sonora. The Cananea district was mapped by Teran Martinez et al. (1999) of the Servicio Geologico Mexicano at 1:250,000 scale. A wide variety of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks of various ages occur in the region; the geologic history of this region is relatively complex. The oldest rock units within the property region are gneisses of Early Proterozoic age that belong to the Bamori Metamorphic Complex, which formed as a result of the Mazatazal Orogeny. These gneisses occur about 15 km to the south, and to the southeast, of the Dos Naciones Property area. Granite of Proterozoic age is also exposed south of the property.
Areas of Cambrian age quartzite have been mapped within the Dos Naciones Property. The next youngest rocks are extensive sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Jurassic age. These include rhyolite and sandstone of possible Early Jurassic age and younger sandstone, siltstone, argillite and minor limestone of Late Jurassic age; andesite flows are locally interstratified with the Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks. Late Jurassic sandstone hosts most of the gold and silver occurrences northeast of Cucurpe. Limestone and shale of Cretaceous age overlie the Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks to the west of the Dos Naciones Property. The stratified rock units are intruded by a large body of granodiorite and granite of Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary age known as the Laramide Batholith. Cretaceous-aged limestone and shale are overlain by Tertiary rhyolite to the east of Dos Naciones. Tertiary conglomerate covers much of the property region, especially the sides of the wide, northerly trending valleys. Regional deformation has resulted in numerous faults crosscutting the Dos Naciones Property area. Most of these faults have likely been reactivated at different times. Regional-scale, northerly trending normal faults indicate that east-west crustal extension has occurred since the Tertiary Period.
Mineralization
The economic mineralization encountered to date on the Dos Naciones Project property is quartz veins containing galena, silver and minor gold. In addition, skarn or calc-silicate rocks at Dos Naciones locally contain gold, silver and copper. Thus, there have been at least two episodes of gold and silver mineralization at the Dos Naciones Property. The geological setting of the Dos Naciones Property is favourable for economic porphyry copper deposits.
Dos Naciones Occurrence Area
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Dos Naciones occurrence area, in the southwest corner of the Dos Naciones Property. There is a 30 m deep shaft excavated within granitic intrusive rock at the Dos Naciones occurrence area, which shows the geology and sampling at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. No vein is exposed in the sides of the shaft opening, and David Pawliuk did not attempt to enter the shaft. The size and attitude of the mineralized vein in these underground workings is unknown. However, the vein is at least 30 cm wide, because vein quartz pieces up to 30 cm in diameter were found in the dump pile. The mineralized vein may possibly occur along the contact between the argillite wallrock and the intrusive granodiorite. A short quartz vein crosscutting argillite is exposed downslope of the old workings, near the contact with the intrusive granodiorite; this vein dips to the southwest. The old mine workings at the Dos Naciones occurrence area are spaced over a distance of about 250 m on surface, indicating that the mineralized silver-lead quartz vein here extends at least 250 m along strike.
From the size of the mine dump piles, David Pawliuk estimates that at least 1,000 tonnes of vein material has been mined at Dos Naciones occurrence area. A select sample, number E51556, of the better-mineralized vein material from this dump collected by David Pawliuk contains 221 parts per million (ppm) or 221 g/t silver, 4.44% lead and 0.636% zinc. Historic sample 464311 of select material from the same dump contained 88 g/t silver, 1.75% lead and 1% zinc.
Josefina Area
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Josefina area in the central part of the Dos Naciones Property. There are at least three quartz veins within the Josefina area. These veins dip steeply to the northeast, extend for at least 250 m along strike, and are open along strike and at depth. A short shaft has been excavated within one of these quartz veins.
David Pawliuk collected rock sample E51559 from a mineralized quartz vein at Josefina, as a check on the results for historic sample 464345. The quartz vein here is milky white with traces of light brown limonite along weathered fracture surfaces; no sulphide minerals were seen. The vein dips at about 60 degrees to the east. This vein is almost certainly emplaced along a fault; there is a 6 or 8 cm wide band within the central part of the vein that is finely banded on a mm scale. The vein quartz is sugary and sandy within this band, indicating movement after the vein was emplaced. The quartz vein formed during at a series of pulses; there are at least seven distinct bands within the vein; each of these bands is marked by subhedral quartz crystals lining open spaces within the vein. The bands are up to 4 cm wide. Open cavities within the vein locally are up to 10 by 25 by 8 cm across. Sample E51559 contains 22.3 g/t silver, 0.044 g/t gold, 0.354% lead and 137 ppm zinc across 1.8 m. Historic sample 464345 from the same site contained 39 g/t silver, less than 0.005 g/t gold, 0.40% lead and 69 ppm zinc.
In October 2010, fieldwork completed by our company was successful in identifying multiple new exposures of veins as well as a historic working that was previously unknown. The Josefina target now consists of a series of at least six sub-parallel veins with the core of the silver/lead system having been traced along surface for approximately 600 meters along strike and over 250 meters wide. Highlights from the 38 samples submitted are channel chip samples from the interior of the Josefina working returning 129g/t Ag with 5.23% Pb over 1.0 meters and 105g/t Ag with 4.21% Pb over 0.50 meters.
La Espanola
La Espanola area is on the east side of the Dos Naciones Property. Here, David Pawliuk saw a reverse circulation drillsite that appears to be several years old. Minera Alta Vista has determined that six drillholes were completed in the La Espanola area during the 1990’s. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these holes were drilled by Penoles, the largest mining company in Mexico. The results of this drilling are unknown to David Pawliuk. Minera Alta Vista is currently seeking additional information pertaining to these drill holes.
Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security
David Pawliuk collected four geochemical rock samples from the Dos Naciones Project property area on March 9, 2009. Three of these samples were collected from Dos Naciones occurrence area, and one from the Josefina area. The rock samples were bagged, and the bags were sealed by David Pawliuk. The samples were then transported via truck from Dos Naciones Property to Minera Alta Vista’s offices at Hermosillo, Sonora. The samples were delivered to ALS Chemex Laboratories in Hermosillo on March 10, 2009 by David Pawliuk. David Pawliuk maintained custody of the samples from the time the samples were collected until the samples were delivered to ALS Chemex Laboratories facility at Hermosillo. The rocks were analyzed for gold by geochemical fire assay, solvent extraction and atomic adsorption spectrometry. A subsample of 30 gm was assayed. The rock sample was also analyzed for silver, mercury, arsenic, antimony and 46 other elements by aqua regia acid digestion ICPMS.
Data Verification
The results of geochemical rock sampling show that economic concentrations of silver and gold occur in quartz veins from two separate areas within the Dos Naciones Property. Limited historic production has occurred from these veins. The results of geochemical rock sampling also show that copper-iron skarns within the Dos Naciones Property also contain gold and silver. Skarns have also been mined within the property area. As outlined above in the section on mineralization, the results of David Pawliuk’s geochemical rock sampling confirmed the results of historic sampling on the property by Yale Resources Ltd. during 2008.
