ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource”, which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
Map of properties
The map below shows the location of Midway’s properties located in Nevada, USA. These properties are described in further detail below.
Spring Valley Project
Location and means of access
The Spring Valley property is located in Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 20 miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The property is situated in the Spring Valley Mining District, three miles north of Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation’s Rochester Mine and is accessed on Nevada State Highway 50, which extends eastward from US Interstate 80.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since 2003 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and through mining leases. Unpatented mining claims are kept active through payment of a maintenance fee due to the BLM and each county the claims are located in on 31 August of each year. Certain areas of the Spring Valley project are subject to Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalties ranging from 1% to 7% on different claim groups within the project package.
In addition, Midway owns the surface rights on 544.2 acres of fee ground in Section 3, T28N, R34E MDBM. Newmont Mining Company holds a lease on the mineral rights to this ground. This ground is part of the Santa Fe checkerboard land package Newmont acquired in 1997.
In 2008, the Company paid the following lease payments to maintain certain mineral leases in the Spring Valley project:
·
On September 1, 2008 Midway paid its annual payment of US$100,000 ($104,179) to Echo Bay Exploration Inc. to maintain its option to acquire 28 unpatented mining claims called the SV claims contiguous to the Spring Valley Claims. Echo Bay retained a 2% royalty on NSR from commercial production on these claims.
·
On April 25, 2008 Midway paid its annual payment of US$36,000 ($36,362) to Lamonte J. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 12 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner retained a 3% NSR Royalty. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
On July 1, 2008 Midway paid in advance its US$1,000 a month option payment totaling US$6,000 to George D. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
On July 18, 2008 Midway paid its annual payment of US$20,000 to Dave Rowe and Randall Stoebert ($20,836) to maintain its option to purchase 97 unpatented mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for $600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Rowe and Mr. Stoebert retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
·
On October 30, 2008 Midway paid its annual payment of US$5,000 ($6,062) to Dale and Diana Chabino to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$100,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Chabino and Mrs. Chabino retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
·
On May 5, 2006, the Company purchased land and mineral rights of 920 gross acres, 320 acres net surface, 770 acres net mineral, (the “Seymork Parcel”) from Seymork Investments Ltd. (“Seymork”) for US$200,000, subject to a 3% NSR royalty on any production and sale of metals from the claims. On June 11, 2008 the Court settled a long standing title dispute to this ground validating the Company’s claim to the Seymork Parcel. The settlement allowed the Company to purchase two promissory notes secured against the property for approximately US$598,000 ($609,788) in July 2008. In the future, the Company may elect to sell up to 27.6 square miles of interests in lands included in the purchase (9.1 square miles of net surface, 19 square miles net minerals) but not needed for development of the Spring Valley project to recover a portion of the cost.
Over the years Midway has staked additional claims and purchased rights to additional claims outright within and adjacent to the Spring Valley property. During the year ended December 31, 2008 the Company staked additional claims at a cost of US$1,392 ($1,405).
Exploration completed by Midway
Midway staff geologists took over the execution of the exploration program from Global Geologic Services Inc. in late 2004 and we discovered the Porphyry and Sill zones in 2005. During the 2004-2005 drill campaign, Midway drilled 90 reverse circulation holes totaling 44,965 feet and 21 diamond drill holes totaling 10,008.7 feet. Midway focused on definition of the Sill and Porphyry zones and drilling of exploration targets in the east and west margins of the Property, including the West Diatreme and Ring Zone targets. All core holes from this campaign were drilled in the resource area (Pond, Sill and Porphyry zones) as were 65 of the 90 RC holes. In January 2006, Midway commissioned AMEC E&C Services, Inc. (“AMEC”) to develop a mineral resource estimate conforming to NI43-101 that included results of 93,165.7 feet of drilling in 164 holes completed up to January 2006.
In 2006, we completed 66,616 feet of drilling in 90 holes with 88 of the holes drilled outside the defined resource expanding it to the north (North Hill and Porphyry deposits) and the West (West Diatreme and Valley Breccia deposits). The 2006 exploration program was designed to step out from the current resource around the edge of the diatreme to expand the known resource as well as testing for a much larger porphyry gold target at deeper levels. At
the time of AMEC’s June 2006 resource estimation the deposit covered a mineralized zone of 0.6 miles long by 0.3 miles wide that was continuous to a depth of 984 feet. Exploration in 2006 expanded the gold zones to an area of almost 1 mile long by 0.6 miles wide that is continuous mineralized to a depth of 1,400 feet. Additional project work included a 3,000 soil sample grid survey, detailed stream sediment sampling, gravity and Self Potential geophysical surveys, mapping and rock chip sampling of 17 square miles of claim holdings all directed towards expanding the potential size of this growing mineral resource.
Exploration at the end of 2006 had identified distinct gold zones at Spring Valley: the North Hill, West Diatreme, Porphyry, Pond, Sill, Valley Breccia and Limerick Hagen zones. Surface exploration programs in 2006 identified more than 12 new targets for follow up work.
In August 2007, Midway completed the purchase of the key Schmidt lease in Spring Valley by paying the final US$3,000,000 due. This payment was the final advance royalty payment for the bulk of the current discovery on the Schmidt lease and completes the final payment of royalty payments on the first 500,000 ounces of gold produced from this central claim package.
In 2007, we drilled 102,000 feet in the greater Spring Valley project area to expand the West Diatreme and North Hill zones and to test the deep porphyry potential. Limited infill drilling was completed on the Pond, Porphyry and Sill zones. These zones form a coherent gold trend 3,500 feet long and 3,500 feet wide that has been tested to a depth of 1,400 feet. The mineralization remains open to the northeast, southwest and at depth. An additional 10,850 feet was drilled on the Limerick, American Canyon, King David and Golden Gate satellite targets. Drilling is planned to follow-up gold and silver intercepts on three of these targets.
An updated resource estimate was announced for Spring Valley in January, 2008. The new Inferred mineral resource estimate was made by AMEC. The model left a large number of grade blocks outside of the L-G optimization shell, and Midway worked with AMEC to refine the grade model and to identify areas where additional drilling could bring known mineralization into the resource.
Drilling from February to August 2008 completed 87 holes including 63,565 feet of RC and 8,985 feet of core drilling targeting significant mineralization recognized outside the current resource. Nearly 75% of these new holes had significant gold intercepts. Drilling has now identified a coherent gold zone 5,000 feet long by 2,500 feet wide and extends to a depth of 1,400 feet. Known mineralization remains open to the north, southwest and at depth. Gold intercepts for 20 holes were reported on July 8, 2008, including 5 feet of 1.114 opt gold within 75 feet of 0.119 opt gold in SV08-417 and 140 feet of 0.021 opt gold in SV 08-403 and 80 feet of 0.031 opt gold in SV 08-410. New gold discovered in the Big Leap zone on the north end of the deposit was reported on September 11, 2008. Intercepts in this zone included 5 feet of 0.667 opt gold with 110 feet of 0.061 opt gold in hole SV08-436 and SV 08-432 with 25 feet of 0.294 opt gold within 40 feet of 0.190 opt gold. The Big Leap zone has been intercepted over 1400 feet along strike, is 200 to 400 feet wide, and is still open to both the north and south and at depth. Two outlying targets, the Fitting and Limerick areas, were tested with a total of 22 exploration drill holes with no significant results. Results from deep core drilling tested a gold bearing porphyry intrusive as announced on January 19, 2009. The more significant intercepts were in hole SV08-396C including 3 feet of 0.101 opt gold from 425 feet to 428 feet and 9.9 feet of 0.215 opt gold from 1,135.1 feet to 1,145 feet. Hole SV08-397C reported 5 feet of 0.114 opt gold from 909 feet to 914 feet and 4 feet of 0.117 opt gold from 977 feet to 981 feet.
On March 2, 2009 the Company announced an updated mineral resource estimate of 87,750,000 tons grading 0.021 opt containing 1,835,615 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 0.006 opt using a $715 Lerchs-Grossman Optimization Shell. This updated estimate represents an 85% increase in contained gold at Spring Valley and includes the 2008 drill holes. It incorporates portions of the West Diatreme, North Hill and newly discovered Big Leap zones that were not included in the last resources estimate prepared by AMEC at December 15, 2007. Gold mineralization remains open for expansion to the north, south, and at depth.
This resource estimate is in compliance with Canada’s NI 43-101 and in accordance with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. It was conducted under the supervision of Eric LeLacheur (CPG), Spring Valley Project Manager, and Don Harris (M.Sc., CPG), Vice President-Advanced Projects (Midway), who are the Qualified Persons responsible for the resource.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource”, which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
The current resource estimate includes drill results from 450 holes up to December 31, 2008 in the Pond, Sill, Porphyry, Valley Breccia, North Hill, West Diatreme, and Big Leap Zones. Mineralized domains were established by interpretation of geological, structural and assay information on sections. Assays within the domains were composited into 10 foot intervals. Search distances and directions were established using spherical variograms on the composites within the domains. A capping threshold of 1.00 opt gold was utilized, and assays greater than 1.00 opt gold were set to 1.00 opt gold. This cap is slightly lower than that used by AMEC. Higher grade composites between 0.25 and 1.0 opt were given a restricted range of 100 feet to limit high grade influences. A density of 12.6 cubic feet per short ton was applied to all bedrock material, and 14.0 cubic feet per short ton was applied to alluvium overburden. A three dimensional block model was generated using Surpac®, a commercially available mine planning software package. Composited assays were used to estimate tons and gold grades within domains using an inverse distance cubed (ID3) estimation method. Resources reported are included within a Lerchs-Grossmann (L-G) optimization shell using a $715 per ounce gold price. The L-G shell is an economic test that simulates a break even pit using current mining costs.
A Technical Report by Midway supporting disclosure of this mineral resource will be filed on the Company’s profile on www.sedar.com by April 16, 2009. The Technical Report updates the project as of December 31, 2008, and outlines work on the resource and progress to date.
Agreement with Barrick Gold
On March 10, 2009, Midway, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MGC Resources Inc., executed an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement, effective March 9, 2009 (the “EDM Agreement”), with Barrick Gold Exploration Inc. (“Barrick”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, regarding the exploration, development and possible joint venture of Midway’s Spring Valley Gold Project in Pershing County, Nevada (the “Project”).
Exploration Period
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, MGC granted to Barrick the exclusive right to explore and develop the Project. During this exploration period, Barrick has the exclusive right to earn a 60% interest in the Project by spending US$30,000,000 on the property (US$4,000,000 guaranteed in the first year ending December 31, 2009) over a five-year period ending December 31, 2013. During this five-year period, outside of the mandatory first year expenditure, Barrick shall have the sole right to determine the nature, scope, extent and method of all operations in relation to the property, without having to consult or gain the approval of the Midway. Barrick will be required to provide Midway with certain information and reports and access to the Project to conduct inspections of operations during this period.
After vesting at 60%, Barrick may increase its interest by 10% (70% total) by spending an additional US$8,000,000 on or before December 31, 2014. At Midway’s election, Barrick may also earn an additional 5% (75% total) by carrying Midway to a production decision and arranging financing for Midway’s share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by Barrick once production has been established.
Midway will coordinate geologic and administrative activities during the earn-in period for a negotiated administrative fee.
Joint Venture
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, Midway shall have a period of 120 days from the last of the following events to occur to elect to enter into a joint venture agreement with Barrick with respect to the Project: (i) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has not elected to earn the additional 10% interest by spending an additional US$8,000,000; (ii) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has timely incurred the additional US$8,000,000 expenditure on the Project to earn the additional 10% interest; (iii) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has elected but failed to timely incur the additional US$8,000,000 expenditure on the Project. If Midway fails to notify Barrick within the 120-day period, Midway will be deemed to have elected to enter into the joint venture with Barrick.
If Midway elects or is deemed to have elected to enter into the joint venture agreement with Barrick, initial capital accounts will be established in accordance with Barrick’s earned interest in the Project and Barrick will become the manager of the joint venture
If Midway elects not to enter into the joint venture, then either: (i) within 365 days of Midway’s notice electing not to enter into the joint venture, Barrick will exercise its option to purchase Midway’s interest in the Project for US$40,000,000 and a 2% net smelter royalty return (NSR) on production from the Project; or (ii) Barrick will elect not to exercise its option to purchase Midway’s interest in the Project and the joint venture will be formed with Midway being deemed to have elected the carry option and any operations costs incurred by Barrick in the 365-day election period will be treated as Midway’s development costs.
The EDM Agreement also provides for the adjustment of a party’s participating interest in the joint venture upon default in making agreed-upon contributions to adopted programs and budgets or upon contributing less to a program and budget than a percentage equal to the party’s participating interest.
Further, the EDM Agreement provides that if Midway’s participation interest falls below 10%, Midway shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and all of Midway’s participating interests will be assigned to Barrick, with Midway reserving a 2% NSR.
Under the EDM Agreement, a party’s whose recalculated participating interest is reduced to 10% shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and shall relinquish its entire participating interest. Such relinquished participating interest shall be deemed to have accrued automatically to the other party. The reduced party shall have the right to receive 10% of net proceeds, if any, to a maximum amount of 75% percent of the reduced party’s equity account balance as of the effective date of the withdrawal. Upon receipt of such amount, the reduced party shall thereafter have no further right, title, or interest in the Project or under the EDM Agreement.
Barrick is required to conduct and fund exploration in 2009 on the Spring Valley project at a minimum level of US$4,000,000. Barrick has informed Midway its program will include 45,000 feet of infill core and reverse circulation drilling and approximately twelve holes will be drilled for metallurgical testing purposes
Pan Project
Location and means of access
The Pan Gold property is located at the northern end of the Pancake mountain range in western White Pine County, Nevada, approximately 22 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada, and 50 miles west of Ely, Nevada.
Access to the Pan Gold property is via a seven mile dirt road that heads south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Eureka has a population of about 2,000.
The Pan Gold property is situated within the high desert of the Basin and Range physiographic province. Elevations in the immediate project area range from about 6,450 ft to a high of 7,400 ft above sea level. Climatologic records are not available for immediate Pan Gold area, but the town of Eureka averages about 12 inches of precipitation per year, with average temperatures ranging from 28° F in the winter months to 70° F in the summer months. Daytime
temperatures exceeding 90° F during July and August are not uncommon. Sagebrush is the dominant vegetation at the site, with Juniper and Pinon Pine occurring at some of the higher elevations.
The nearest power line is adjacent to US Highway 50 approximately five miles to the north. Water to support exploration drilling is available from a well used for watering livestock that is in close proximity to the Pan property.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since April 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases.
Midway assumed the January 7, 2003 mineral lease agreement with Gold Standard Royalty Corporation (“GSRC”). On or before January 5 of each year Midway must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of US$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 174 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale NSR production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. Midway must incur a minimum of US$65,000 year work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease. On January 1, 2008 the Company paid US$118,343 and on January 1, 2009 the Company paid US$151,658.
Subsequent to acquiring Pan-Nevada Midway staked additional claims adjacent to the Pan property some of which fall within the one mile area of interest of the GSRC mining lease and will be subject to the NSR royalty to GSRC. Midway has staked additional claims around the project, increasing the land holdings to over 13 square miles.
Mineral Resources
Prior to Midway acquiring the Pan project, M. Gustin, B.Sc. (Geol), Ph.D. (Econ Geol.), of Mine Development Associates had estimated mineral resources to NI 43-101 reporting standards for the Pan project. The resources were reported in a technical report entitled “Pan Gold Project - Updated Technical Report - White Pine County, Nevada USA” which we refer to as the “Pan Technical Report” dated January 15, 2005. This report was filed on the profile of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation at www.sedar.com on February 7, 2005.
Measured and Indicated Resources for the Pan Gold Project
Inferred Resources for the Pan Gold Project
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource”, which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
Mineral resources for the Pan Gold project were classified based on the distance of the model blocks to the composite data. All classified blocks required a minimum of two composites to receive an estimated gold grade and lie within the gold domain boundaries. Measured resource blocks received an interpolated grade in the first estimation pass and lie within 40 feet of the nearest Pan-Nevada composite. Indicated resource blocks consist of all other blocks assigned a grade by the first estimation. Inferred resource blocks are those model blocks inside of the interpreted gold domain boundaries that were estimated by the second estimation pass.
Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral resources for the Pan Gold project are shown in the tables above. Measured resources are restricted to a short radius around Pan-Nevada composites due to the lack of documentation regarding the sampling, sample preparation, analytical procedures, and laboratory QA/QC practices of all previous operators.
A cutoff of 0.010 oz Au/ton was applied to the Pan model blocks for the purposes of tabulating the mineral resources. Higher cutoffs are also shown to provide grade-distribution information. The cutoff grade was chosen in consideration of parameters that reflect potential open-pit mining and heap-leach processing of the mineralization. These parameters include that the resources are entirely oxidized, metallurgical testing, while not comprehensive enough for the purposes of final feasibility work, suggests that the resources are amenable to heap-leach processing, and the resources are contained within continuous zones whose shallow depths and configurations suggest potential open-pit extraction can reasonably be assumed. As no economic studies have been completed at Pan, MDA derived the cutoff on the basis of comparable mining operations in Nevada. The North and South Pan estimations were checked by comparing: (1) estimated block grades and drill hole assays on cross sections; (2) the inverse distance cubed and kriging estimates of North and South Pan, respectively, to nearest neighbor calculations; and (3) the grade distributions of the coded assays, composites, estimated block grades, and nearest neighbor grades.
Exploration
The Pan project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit on the prolific Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend in Nevada. It is an oxide deposit exposed on the surface with simple metallurgy. In 2007 Midway drilled 35,510 feet in 113 holes. Four new gold zones were discovered at Nana, Barite, Wendy, and Boulders. Drill results at Boulders extended gold north for 1,300 feet under volcanic outcrop at North Pan. Drill results at Barite and Wendy extended gold at South Pan by 400 feet south and 300 feet east respectively. The Nana zone, 4,000 feet northwest of North Pan, represents a new exploration opportunity. All four of these new discoveries remain open for expansion along strike and dip.
A large scale soil survey identified four previously unknown gold-arsenic anomalies with no previous exploration drilling. Results from a recently completed detailed gravity survey have also outlined several new targets areas. As a result, additional claims were staked bringing the property position to 15 square miles.
In 2008 Midway completed 26,245 feet of drilling in 49 RC holes. Drilling at South Pan found additional near surface oxide gold mineralization. The Wendy zone was expanded to the east where it extends under volcanic cover and step-out drilling at Nana encountered more new gold-both zones are open for expansion. Three target areas outside the resource were tested with no significant results. Fourteen new holes in the resource area were targeted to verify results from previous operators, of which most intercepted higher grades and greater thicknesses than
previously reported (Press Release July 9, 2008). Preliminary investigations suggest that assay techniques used by a previous operator may have under-estimated gold values in some of the holes. If confirmed by additional drilling, then portions of the deposit could show improved grades. A new higher-grade gold zone has also been identified over 800 feet in length at North Pan with true widths ranging from 10 to 25 feet and grades ranging from 0.07 to 0.51 opt gold.
At a minimum Midway’s staff will prepare an internal updated mineral resource estimate in 2009 which will guide the next exploration step for the Pan project. Pending additional financing from the exercise of share purchase warrants or an equity private placement in 2009 and based on the results of the updated mineral resource estimate the next step would either be infill and exploration drilling or the Company would commission an independently prepared preliminary assessment report (scoping study). The amount of drilling required will determine the cost of the program.
Midway Project
Location and means of access
The Midway property is located in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 24 kilometers northeast of the town of Tonopah, 335 kilometers northwest of Las Vegas and 380 kilometers southeast of Reno. The property is over the northeastern flank of the San Antonio Mountains and in the Ralston Valley.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since 2001 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases subject to a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2% to 7% from commercial production based on changes in gold prices.
In addition, the surface rights to 560 acres in Section 32 are held by the Town of Tonopah. The remaining 80 acres of surface rights in Section 32 are held as two 40-acre parcels by two owners, each of whom lives on their parcel. We hold the federal mineral rights of the entirety of Section 32 in unpatented claims.
On August 15, 2008 the Company paid the annual minimum advance royalty, recoverable from commercial production of US$300,000.
Drilling
Between May 1 and September 5, 2002, Midway completed 26,689.5 feet of drilling in 69 holes, mostly HQ core. Newmont entered into a joint venture on the Midway property in September 2002 and undertook extensive regional exploration programs including numerous regional and detailed geophysical surveys, including electromagnetic (“EM”), airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys, and ground radiometric, gravity and Controlled Source Audio Magneto Telluric (“CSAMT”) surveys. Newmont also mapped the Northwest and Thunder Mountain areas and completed rock and stream sediment geochemical surveys. From September 2002 to August 2003 the Newmont/Midway joint venture drilled a total of 67,703.5 feet in 121 holes in the greater Discovery area, the Thunder Mountain target area, and in the northwestern portion of the property.
From August 2003 to February 2005, the Newmont/Midway joint venture drilled 23 angle holes for a total of 16,042 feet, including one hole that was abandoned at a depth of seven meters. Seven of the holes were drilled by reverse circulation methods, while the remainder was HQ core holes with reverse circulation pre-collars; a total of 10,195 feet of reverse circulation and 5,847 feet of core were drilled. Of the 22 holes that were completed, five were drilled in the 121 Zone and 17 were drilled in largely untested areas in the greater Discovery area to the south of the Discovery zone. The five holes drilled in the 121 Zone were primarily designed to test for high-grade zones of restricted widths deep in the Palmetto Formation, lying below similar zones intercepted by previous operators; results of this deeper testing did not prove up continuity and geometry although intercepts of 0.18 to 1.90 ounce per ton gold over lengths of 1.3 to 5 feet were intersected in three of the holes. Of the remaining holes, three returned intercepts exceeding 0.087 ounce per ton gold.
In 2005, Midway drilled 8,987 feet in 16 reverse circulation holes to test for extensions adjacent to the known resource areas. The program resulted in the discovery of the Dauntless Zone that could be a potential feeder zone for the main Discovery Zone. Hole MW399 encountered 175 feet of 0.349 ounces per ton gold in drill hole MW399, which includes a vein assaying 15 feet of 3.163 ounces per ton gold, and 135 feet of 0.058 ounces per ton gold in MW402.
In 2006, we drilled 26,450 feet in 56 reverse circulation and core holes. Gold was intersected in all six zones tested. In this phase, the Dauntless zone was extended 650 feet along strike. The zone varies from 23 to 66 feet in true width and is composed of two to three distinct southwest dipping sub-parallel veins. The veins vary in grade from 0.029 to 1.16 ounces per ton gold starting within 165 feet of the surface and are open along strike to the north and south. The Enterprise and Cross zones have each been tested by at least five drill holes that have encountered veins with gold. Limited gold was also encountered in the Hornet and Nautilus and the 121 South zones.
Following drilling, we developed three-dimensional vein models of the Midway high-grade gold zones. Twelve veins were identified in the Discovery and Dauntless zones that were drilled at a nominal 50 foot centers. Drill testing of these 12 veins is adequate to design an underground exploration bulk sample test. An additional 58 high-grade (>0.15 ounces of gold per ton) veins have been identified by drilling in the project, but they are not yet fully explored.
During the third quarter of 2006, we hired a mining engineer from the Colorado School of Mines to develop plans for an underground exploration decline. The decline would allow bulk sampling of the Discovery and Dauntless gold zones for metallurgical testing and allow better access for exploration of the gold zones at Midway.
In December 2006, we drilled and installed 14 monitor wells to study the dewatering costs for the underground decline when four of the holes encountered gold. In an extension of the Dauntless zone, monitor well hole MW06-47H intercepted 10 feet of 0.306 ounces per ton gold. The vein is estimated to be four feet true width and is approximately 130 feet south of the Dauntless zone. These tests indicate that gold persists in vein zones peripheral to the Discovery zone. The hydrology holes will determine water characterization for planning and permitting of an underground exploration decline into the Discovery and Dauntless deposits.
In April 2007, we completed a 450 foot water well in the Discovery area. Pumping tests were conducted to determine the dewatering needs for an underground exploration decline. An initial 72 hour pumping test was completed and a second 30 day pump test is currently in progress. These tests are needed for the water rights and discharge permits.
In 2007, a three-dimensional analysis of 132 holes in the Discovery Zone found most high-grade intercepts were in narrow vertical veins. The veins occur in sub-parallel clusters, 10 to 20 feet apart, with an average width of 6 feet. In a portion of the Dauntless Foot Wall vein, the maximum width is 22 feet. High-grade gold occurs where the veins cross an unconformity between underlying argillite and overlying volcanic. Veins hosted in the argillite are well-defined veins and breccias. Where they pass upward into the volcanics, veins splay out to form numerous thinner sub-parallel veins in a braided stockwork zone. Visible gold is common in these veins. The re-analysis of the Midway veins has greatly improved our understanding of the gold system. We now recognize a boiling horizon, which deposited the higher grade gold and the structural control of gold shows that many past drill holes missed the key gold horizon along the veins. This gives us an opportunity to significantly expand the gold mineralization on the project.
In 2008, initial mining plans were submitted to the BLM and NDEP for an underground decline providing access for collection of a bulk sample and high-grade verification at the Midway Project. Drilling for hydrology and geotechnical testing was completed on 12 RC holes for 1,234 feet and 9 core holes for 2,321 feet. While drilling these holes, two new high grade veins were discovered (Press Release May 14, 2008). Final permit submission is pending approvals from the State Water Engineer. Hydrologic testing suggests that pumping up to 2,000 gallons per minute may be required to dewater the project. Midway is currently negotiating a plan to properly dispose of this water with the Town of Tonopah and the State Water Engineer. Permitting efforts will continue in 2009 as Midway reviews potential capital benefits from mining the bulk sample on a smaller scale. Five holes were drilled to test the
waste rock storage sites. No gold was noted in the tests and the waste sites will be used as needed. Funding of the remaining cost of permitting is estimated to be US$285,000 is expected to be from working capital. The Company will need to raise the capital to fund the cost of the bulk sample.
Midway processing test work by SGS Lakefield Research Limited (Canada) showed up to 94% gold recovery using gravity and cyanide from a 73-lb. composite sample of Discovery vein material grading 0.188 opt gold. Further work by Gekko Systems Metallurgical Laboratory (Australia) indicates that without using cyanide, a gravity and flotation process could achieve 86.7% gold recovery and 66.3% silver recovery, based on a 242-lb. composite sample, grading 0.662 opt gold and 0.475 opt silver.
We completed a cost analysis to convert the high-grade veins, intercepted by previous drilling, into reserves and this underground bulk sample plan is the most effective way to advance the project. This allows us the opportunity to determine the true grade of the veins and help to delineate reserves and move toward production. The actual date of beginning the decline will depend upon the length of time it takes to receive regulatory approval, which typically takes 8 to 18 months. In addition, we have several hurdles to overcome such as processing site, financing, and availability of contract mining equipment and personnel but the high-grade nature of the deposit and simple metallurgy make the underground bulk sample a logical next step in the exploration and development.
The decline will be an inclined adit (underground tunnel) that will be driven to develop access 200 feet below high grade portions of the Midway, Rochefort and Dauntless veins (see table below and map attached). From these three veins a 50,000 ton bulk sample will be taken and processed. Gold recovered from the bulk samples will offset a portion of the development costs. The decline will also provide a platform to explore and develop 77 high-grade vein intercepts currently identified on the project. In the event that exploration results support a development decision, then underground workings and permits will be in place to begin full scale mining.
The Plan of Operations includes 75 new acres of disturbance which will be reclaimed at the end of the project. If mining proceeds, most mine workings will be filled in with rock from the development work. Any ore or bulk samples will be transported off-site for testing so there will be no processing facility or chemicals on the site. A water treatment plant will treat water discharged from the mine workings. The BLM and NDEP review an environmental analysis of the proposed Plan of Operations which includes public comment periods. In addition, there are 18 other permits required from a variety of federal, state, and local authorities.

The Midway project is located at the intersection of the well-known Round Mountain/Goldfield trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon vein clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization. The best previously reported gold intercept was 2.5 feet of 119 opt gold in 17 feet that averaged 34.7 opt gold in core hole MW210 from the Midway vein.
The map below shows the location of Midway’s property located in Washington, USA. This property is described in further detail below.
Golden Eagle Project
Location and means of access
The Golden Eagle property is approximately 211 acres of private land located in Ferry County, Washington. The property is accessed by driving two miles northwest of the town of Republic, Washington along the Knob Hill county road.
Title
On August 1, 2008 the Company issued 600,000 common shares at US$2.50 per common share for proceeds of US$1,500,000 by way of a private placement to Kinross Gold USA Inc. (“Kinross”) and concurrently purchased a 75% interest in the Golden Eagle, Washington, project from Kinross at a cost of US$1,500,000 ($1,537,950). The Company then purchased a 25% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Hecla Limited at a cost of US$483,333 ($500,200). Kinross retained a 2% net smelter returns royalty and was granted a first right of refusal to toll mill ore from the Golden Eagle property at their Kettle River Mill.
Midway completed the acquisition of the Golden Eagle property through a wholly-owned subsidiary created to hold the property.
Exploration
In 2008, Midway acquired the Golden Eagle project and began compiling and reviewing the historic database of 847 drill holes containing 165,775 feet of mostly core drilling, to create a modern gold model. In 1996, Santa Fe Pacific Gold estimated that the Golden Eagle deposit contained 32.19 million tons grading 0.069 ounce per ton (opt) gold in a historic resource as part of an internal scoping study. A qualified person has not reviewed this resource and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. The project is comprised entirely of private land in the historic Republic gold district.
Efforts in 2009 will primarily be conducted by Midway staff and funded from working capital and will be directed toward key issues, including metallurgy testing, for moving the project towards a new scoping study, including a NI 43-101 compliant resource, high-grade target identification, evaluation of processing methods, and reviewing permitting. Staff is compiling and reviewing the historic data base of 847 drill holes containing 165,775 feet of mostly core drilling to create a modern gold model. Pending additional financing from the exercise of share purchase warrants or an equity private placement in 2009 and the internal review of the project by staff the next step would be to commission an independent NI 43-101 compliant updated mineral resource estimate an expected cost of up to US$125,000.
