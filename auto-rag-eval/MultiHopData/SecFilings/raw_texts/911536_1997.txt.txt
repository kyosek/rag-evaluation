ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
The Company's real estate holdings consist of apartment communities in various stages of the development cycle and can be divided into three categories:
"Current Communities" are apartment communities where construction is complete and the community has either reached stabilized occupancy or is in the initial lease-up process. A "Stabilized Community" is a Current Community that has completed its initial lease-up and has attained a physical occupancy level of 94% or has been completed for one year, whichever occurs earlier. An "Established Community" is a Current Community that has been a Stabilized Community with stabilized operating costs during both the current year and the beginning of the previous calendar year such that its year-to-date operating results are comparable between periods.
"Development Communities" are communities that are under construction and may be partially complete and operating and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received.
"Development Rights" are development opportunities in the very earliest phase of the development process for which the Company has an option to acquire land or owns land to develop a new community and where related pre-development costs have been incurred and capitalized in pursuit of these new developments.
The Company's holdings under each of the above categories are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Current Communities
The Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two-and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The Current Communities, as of March 16, 1998, include eight high-rise apartment communities, two four-story mid-rise apartment communities and one six-story mid-rise apartment community. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities designed to enhance their market appeal to discriminating residents who are willing to pay premium rental rates to live in these apartment communities. Such amenities include vaulted ceilings, lofts, fireplaces, patios/decks and modern appliances. Other features include swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts and business centers. Management has an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. As of March 16, 1998, there were 66 Current Communities. These Current Communities are institutional-quality multifamily apartment communities located in the following areas:
All of the Current Communities are managed and operated by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company completed construction of 2,372 apartment homes in seven communities for a capitalized cost of $302.4 million. Forty-eight of the Current Communities have more than 200 apartment homes, with the largest having 932 apartment homes. The average age of 64 of the Current Communities, weighted according to number of apartment homes, is approximately eight years. The remaining Current Communities (Falkland Chase and Longwood Towers) are older communities that were acquired by the Company. Falkland Chase underwent extensive renovation in 1987. Longwood Towers is currently under substantial renovation, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 1998.
To comply with the requirements of lenders and tax-exempt credit enhancers, the Company holds 19 Current Communities and one Development Community in 10 qualified REIT subsidiaries. The Company owns general partnership interests in three Current Communities (a 50% interest in Falkland Chase, a 49% equity interest in Avalon Run and a 50% interest in Avalon Grove), a 99% general partnership interest in two partnerships structured as DownREITs that owns a total of 8 Current Communities, a 100% interest in a senior participating mortgage note secured by another Current Community (Avalon Arbor) which is accounted for as an investment in real estate, a 100% partnership interest in 4100 Massachusetts Avenue, Avalon at Lake Arbor, Avalon at Decoverly, Avalon Commons and Avalon at Fairway Hills II and holds direct fee simple interests in the remaining Current Communities.

Development Communities
As of March 16, 1998, 11 Development Communities were under construction which, when completed, will add a total of 2,825 apartment homes to the Company's portfolio. Subsequent to year end, the Company commenced construction on two of the Development Rights (Avalon Valley and Avalon Lake) which had a capitalized cost at December 31, 1997 of approximately $786,000. The Development Communities will resemble the Current Communities and have been designed to offer similar amenities. The total capitalized cost of these Development Communities, when completed, is expected to be approximately $367.3 million. The following is a summary of the Development Communities:
DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES SUMMARY
- ------------
(1) Stabilized occupancy is defined as the first full quarter of 94% or greater occupancy. (2) Projected EBITDA represents gross potential earnings projected to be achieved based on current rents prevailing in the respective community's local market (without adjustment for potential growth factors) and before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items, minus (a) economic vacancy and (b) projected stabilized operating expenses. Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. EBITDA is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the Company because it indicates cash flow available from Company operations to service fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to the Company's calculation of EBITDA.
The Company intends to periodically update the projections in the table on the preceding page to the extent Management believes there may be or has been a material change in these projections on an aggregate basis. There can be no assurance that the Company will complete the Development Communities, that the Company's budgeted costs, leasing, start dates, completion dates, occupancy or estimates of "EBITDA as % of Total Budgeted Cost" will be realized or that future developments will realize comparable returns.
In accordance with GAAP, the Company capitalizes interest expense during construction until each building obtains a certificate of occupancy; thereafter, interest for each completed building is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 totaled $9.0 million, $12.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
Development Rights
As of March 16, 1998, the Company was pursuing the development of 18 new apartment communities. The status of these new communities ranges from land owned or under option for which design and architectural planning has just commenced to land under contract or owned by the Company with completed site plans and drawings where construction can commence almost immediately. Although there is no assurance that all or any of these communities will proceed to development, the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 4,900 institutional-quality apartment homes to the Company's portfolio. Many of these apartment homes will offer features similar to those offered by the Current Communities, including vaulted ceilings, lofts, fireplaces, dishwashers, disposals, washer/dryer connections, ice-makers, patios and decks. Recreational facilities may include swimming pools, fitness facilities, playgrounds, picnic areas, tennis courts, racquetball courts or indoor basketball courts. Direct-access garages are also planned for certain Development Rights.
The Company generally holds Development Rights through options to acquire land, although one development right is controlled through a joint venture partnership that owns land (New Canaan, CT). As of December 31, 1997, the cumulative capitalized costs for the 18 current Development Rights is approximately $11.9 million including the capitalized cost of $7.3 million related to the purchase of land in New Canaan, Connecticut. The properties that comprise the Development Rights are located in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Virginia and Connecticut and are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to pursue, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made are business judgments to be made by Management after financial, demographic and other analysis is performed. There can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary governmental approvals or the financing required to develop these communities, or that the Company will decide to develop any particular community. Further, there can be no assurance that construction of any particular community will be undertaken or, if undertaken, will begin at the expected times assumed in the financial projections or be completed at the total budgeted costs assumed in the financial projections. Finally, Management intends to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new developments and acquisitions. To comply with Management's self-imposed limitation in the use of debt, future equity offerings may be required to finance the development of those Development Rights scheduled to start construction after 1998. Notwithstanding the lack of assurance with respect to the prospective development of any particular community that is the subject of the Development Rights, Management believes that the Development Rights, in the aggregate, present attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of the Company's Funds from Operations (as hereinafter defined).
Historically, Management has been successful in controlling land through option agreements prior to commencing construction. Generally, this allowed the Company to limit exposure to development risks by purchasing land only when the entitlement process was complete and when construction could commence immediately after the purchase of the land. Accordingly, at March 16, 1998, the Company did not directly own any unentitled and undeveloped land. The Company, however, holds an 86.5% non-recourse joint venture partnership interest in a partnership that owns undeveloped land. The Company may purchase undeveloped land before development and financing plans are complete if, in Management's judgment, controlling the land through an option agreement is not viable, the land can be acquired under attractive terms, is in the advanced
stages of the entitlement process and can proceed to development within a medium-term planning and marketing horizon. The current inventory of Development Rights is summarized in the following table:
(1) Currently anticipated that the land seller will retain a minority limited partnership interest.
