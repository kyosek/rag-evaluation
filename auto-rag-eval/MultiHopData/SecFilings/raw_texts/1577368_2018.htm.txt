ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our Portfolio
We operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Within the U.S., we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets and other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes.
Operating Properties
The following table presents an overview of the portfolio of operating properties that we own or lease, referred to herein as our operating properties, based on information as of December 31, 2018. The table excludes data center development associated with land acquired in Phoenix, AZ and Hillsboro, OR. Additionally, the table excludes the 28 acres purchased in Ashburn, VA in 2017, but includes the 24 acres currently under development in Ashburn. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement whereby it contributed the Manassas facility to a 50% owned joint venture. Balances in the following table represent QTS’ full 100% ownership percentage at December 31,
2018, however beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the Company will only report its 50% share of property information related to Manassas.

Description of Our Properties
Below is a description of our properties. More detail is provided for the properties that represent more than ten percent of our total assets or accounted for more than ten percent of our aggregate gross revenues or both as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Atlanta-Metro
Our Atlanta, Georgia facility, or Atlanta-Metro, is currently our largest data center based on total operating NRSF. As of December 31, 2018, the property consisted of approximately 969,000 gross square feet with approximately 857,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 478,000 raised floor operating NRSF. An on-site Georgia Power substation supplies 72 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators, and the facility has 120 MW of transformer capacity. The facility also includes a small amount of private “Class A” office space. As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 99% occupied by 233 customers across our product offerings.
Portions of the Atlanta-Metro facility are included in our development pipeline, as we plan to continue to expand the facility in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we placed approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor into service. Our current under construction development plans call for the addition of up to approximately 29,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 20,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this incremental space will cost approximately $19 million in the aggregate based on current estimates (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2018). Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 52,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 29,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 938,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 527,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, this facility is adjacent to approximately 72 acres of undeveloped land, inclusive of the land purchase in October of 2018, owned by us that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 2.5 million NRSF of raised floor. These 72 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans. In October 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 55 acres of land in Atlanta, Georgia adjacent to its existing Atlanta-Metro mega data center.
We are the beneficial owner of our Atlanta-Metro facility through a bond-financed sale-leaseback structure. This structure is necessary in the State of Georgia to receive property tax abatement. In 2006, the Development Authority of Fulton County (“DAFC”) issued a taxable industrial development revenue bond to us with a face amount of $300 million in exchange for legal title to the facility. The acquisition of the bond by us was “cashless” as the bond was issued to us in exchange for title to the facility. The bond matures on December 1, 2019 and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum. DAFC leased the facility back to us under a bond lease at a rent equal to the debt service on the bond. The bond lease is a triple net lease, which is standard in conduit financing transactions of this type. The rent under the bond lease payable by us, as lessee, is assigned by DAFC to us, as the bondholder. Because the rent and debt service amounts are equal and offsetting, no cash changes hands between DAFC and us. DAFC is the owner and lessor of the facility, but its rights to receive all rental payments and a security interest in the facility have been pledged to us, as the bondholder, as security for the bond. Therefore, we have complete control over the facility at all times. We have an option to buy the facility for $10 when the bond matures on December 1, 2019. If we wish to obtain title earlier, we can do so by simply surrendering and cancelling the bond and paying the $10 option price.

Atlanta-Suwanee
Our Suwanee, Georgia, or Atlanta-Suwanee, facility consists of approximately 370,000 gross square feet, and as of December 31, 2018 it had approximately 321,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 206,000 raised floor operating NRSF. Georgia Power supplies 36 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” private office space and our operating service center, which provides 24x7 support to all of our customers and data centers. As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 92% occupied by 313 customers. We are the fee simple owner of the Atlanta-Suwanee facility.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions the Atlanta-Suwanee facility.
The facility is adjacent to 15 acres of undeveloped land owned by us that we believe could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 310,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately would be 210,000 NRSF of raised floor. These 15 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.

Irving
We purchased our Irving facility in February 2013. Prior to our purchase, the facility was operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility. Similar to our Richmond facility, the Irving facility has significant pre-existing infrastructure. Specifically, the Irving facility has diverse feeds of 140 MW of utility power and approximately 698,000 gross square feet on 39 acres. We are the fee simple owner of the Irving facility.
We acquired our Irving facility because we believe that we will be able to execute a redevelopment strategy similar to our Richmond facility. Given the infrastructure that was already in place due to its former use as a semiconductor fabrication facility, we believe that the incremental costs to redevelop data center raised floor space in this facility will be lower compared to typical costs for ground-up development or redevelopments of other building types. In addition, the access to a significant amount of utility power provides the necessary power capacity to support our growth strategy for our Irving data center. Furthermore, we believe that the Dallas market is an important data center market primarily due to its strong business environment and relatively affordable power costs.
The Irving facility is included in our development pipeline, as we continue to convert the entire facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. We placed approximately 69,000 raised floor NRSF and 25,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we placed approximately 26,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 62,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 25,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2018) approximately $11 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 247,000 total NRSF, of which approximately 77,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 669,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 276,000 NRSF of raised floor.
We own sufficient undeveloped land on the site, approximately 29 acres, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 1.3 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately 680,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These 29 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 95% occupied by 119 customers.

Below is a description of our other properties.
Richmond
Our Richmond, Virginia data center is situated on an approximately 220-acre site comprised of three large buildings available for data center redevelopment, each with two to three floors, and an administrative building that also has space available for data center redevelopment. As of December 31, 2018, the data center had approximately 1.3 million gross square feet with approximately 397,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 167,000 of raised floor operating NRSF. Dominion Virginia Power supplies 110 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. As of December 31, 2018, one of these primary buildings was fully operational as a data center, another was partially operational, and the third was being redeveloped. We believe that our Richmond facility is situated in an ideal location due to its proximity to Washington, DC, which offers numerous sources of demand for our products including the federal government, and provides geographical diversification from the Northern Virginia data center market. There are three core segments that we believe represent the most significant opportunity for our Richmond data center: entities associated with the federal government, given the highly secured nature of this facility and its proximity to Washington, DC; regulated industries, such as financial institutions, given our investments in security and regulatory compliance; and large enterprise customers, given the large scale of this facility. Our Richmond mega data center can accommodate large and growing customers, while also accommodating colocation and cloud and managed services customers, at attractive energy costs.
We acquired our Richmond facility in 2010 through a bankruptcy process. We estimate that the former owner, a semiconductor manufacturer, had invested over $1 billion to develop the facility prior to the bankruptcy. Because the facility operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility prior to our acquisition, it had significant pre-existing infrastructure, including 110 MW of utility power, approximately 25,000 tons of chiller capacity, “Class A” private office space and other related supporting infrastructure. As a result, to date the incremental cost to redevelop the facility into a data center has been lower than the typical cost of ground-up data center development or redevelopment of other types of buildings into data centers. As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 74% occupied by 132 customers across our product offerings.
We are the fee simple owner of the Richmond facility.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions the Richmond facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 888,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 390,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 1.3 million total operating NRSF, including approximately 557,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, we own approximately 111 acres of undeveloped land on the site that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 2.1 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately
1.1 million NRSF would be raised floor. These 111 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
Chicago
Our Chicago facility, which we acquired on July 8, 2014, is the former Sun Times Press facility near downtown Chicago, Illinois. We are the fee simple owner of the Chicago facility. The facility consists of approximately 475,000 gross square feet, including approximately 46,000 raised floor operating NRSF and 24 MW of utility power to the facility and another 47 MW available upon request.
The Chicago facility is included in our development pipeline, as we plan to convert the facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. We placed approximately 14,000 raised floor NRSF and 14,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we placed approximately 18,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 39,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 20,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2018) approximately $10 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 299,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 150,000 would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 433,000 total operating NRSF with raised floor capacity of approximately 216,000 square feet.
We own sufficient undeveloped land on the site, approximately 23 acres, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 350,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 200,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These 23 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 78% occupied by 63 customers.
Leased Facilities Acquired in 2015
We acquired leased facilities as part of our acquisition of Carpathia Hosting, Inc. (“Carpathia”) on June 16, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, these leased facilities, including those subject to capital leases, consisted of five domestic data centers located in Phoenix, Arizona; San Jose, California; Secaucus, New Jersey and Ashburn, Virginia; and four international data centers located in Toronto, Canada; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Hong Kong and London, United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2018, QTS is no longer leasing space at the Harrisonburg VA facility. Customers at the site were successfully migrated to other QTS owned datacenters.
These leased facilities consist of approximately 70,588 gross square feet with approximately 36,488 total operating NRSF, including approximately 31,937 raised floor operating NRSF. We are not currently redeveloping the leased facilities, we have no current plans to further build out or expand any of these leased facilities.
As of December 31, 2018, the facilities were approximately 89% occupied by 66 customers. The majority of the customers at these facilities are cloud and managed services customers which lease small amounts of space.
Santa Clara
Our Santa Clara, California facility was acquired in November 2007. The facility, which is owned subject to a long-term ground sublease as described below, consists of two buildings containing approximately 135,000 gross square feet with approximately 102,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 56,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The facility is situated on a 6.5-acre site in Silicon Valley. Several Silicon Valley Power substations supply 11 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. We believe that Silicon Valley is an ideal data center location due to the large concentration of technology companies and the high local demand for data centers and cloud and managed services.
As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 78% occupied by 82 customers.
Portions of the Santa Clara facility are included in our development pipeline. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 4,000 total operating NRSF, all of which is raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2018) approximately $8 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can expand the facility by approximately 21,000 total raised floor NRSF. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 131,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 81,000 NRSF of raised floor.
The Santa Clara facility is subject to a ground lease. We acquired a ground sublease interest in the land on which the Santa Clara facility is located in November 2007. The ground sublease expires in 2052, subject to two 10-year extension options. The annual rent payable under the ground sublease increases annually by the lesser of 6% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay area. In addition, in 2018 and 2038, the monthly rent will be adjusted to equal one-twelfth of an amount equal to 8.5% of the product of (i) the then fair market value of the demised premises (without taking into account the value of the improvements existing on the land) calculated on a per square foot basis, and (ii) the net square footage of the demised premises. The Company is currently in negotiations to determine the monthly rent payments based on the 2018 fair market value assessment. During the term of the ground lease, we have certain obligations to facilitate the provision of job training, seminars and research opportunities for students of a community college that is adjacent to the property. We are the indirect holder of this ground sublease.
Sacramento
Our Sacramento, California facility, which we acquired in December 2012, is located 120 miles from our Santa Clara facility on a 6.8-acre site. The facility currently consists of approximately 93,000 gross square feet with approximately 81,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 55,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District supplies 8 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility is an institutional grade data center with a classic “N+1” design that provides a single extra uninterruptible power supply module for use in the event of a system failure. This facility will provide our regional customer base with business continuity services along with cloud and managed services. We believe the property’s location is a valuable complement to our Santa Clara facility for our customers, as it will allow them to diversify their footprint in the California market with a single provider. We intend to leverage our existing West Coast regional team and our cloud and managed services sales and support staff to cater to customers in this property, many of which already used managed services when we acquired the property.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions the Sacramento facility.
As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 47% occupied by 133 customers. The majority of the customers at this facility are colocation customers which lease small amounts of space. We are the fee simple owner of the Sacramento facility.
Miami
Our Miami, Florida facility currently consists of approximately 30,000 gross square feet with approximately 26,000 total operating NRSF, including 20,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The property sits on a 1.6-acre site located at Dolphin Center with 4 MW of utility power supplied by Florida Power & Light and backed up by diesel generators. With a wind rating of 185 miles-per-hour, the facility is built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. Miami is a strategic location for us because it is a gateway to the South American financial markets and a transcontinental Internet hub. The Miami facility was under development when we acquired it in April 2008, and we completed the build-out in August 2008. Other than normally recurring capital expenditures, we have no current plans to further build-out or expand the Miami facility.

The Jersey City facility was originally leased by another party in March 2004 and we acquired the lease in October 2006 when we acquired the lessee. The lease expires in September 2026 and is subject to one five-year extension option. The facility
was redeveloped in November 2006, and we subsequently leased it to service customers in New Jersey and New York. The facility is comprised of four floors of a 19 story building located on one city block in the metropolitan New York City area, six miles from Manhattan. PSE&G supplies 7 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” office space. We believe that the location in Jersey City provides us with a crucial presence in the tri-state area, where space is highly coveted given the strong demand from financial services firms.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions of the Jersey City facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 109,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 53,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2018, the facility was approximately 77% occupied by 49 customers.
