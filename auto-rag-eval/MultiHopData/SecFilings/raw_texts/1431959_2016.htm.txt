Our principal executive offices are located at 5700 W. Plano Parkway, Suite 3600, Plano, Texas 75093. We currently lease this office space which totals approximately 3,181 square feet. We believe that the condition and size of our offices are adequate for our current needs.
Investment in oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31,2016 and 2015 is detailed as follows:
Property acquisition cost relates to the Company’s acquisition of the Hazel Project in West Texas. The development costs include reentry of the Johnson #4 well in the south Texas Marcelina area (sold in 2016) and development costs in the Orogrande and Hazel projects in west Texas. No development costs were incurred for Oklahoma properties in 2016.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Reserve Estimates
SEC Case. The following tables sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, the estimated present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10%) of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes (PV-10) and after future income taxes (Standardized Measure) of our proved reserves and our estimated net probable oil and natural gas reserves, each prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with assumptions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of our reserves are located in the United States.
The PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies. We believe investors and creditors use PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and neither it nor the Standardized Measure is intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions at December 31, 2016. For purposes of determining prices, we used the average of prices received for each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016, adjusted for quality and location differences, which was $42.75 per barrel of oil and $2.33 per MCF of gas. This average historical price is not a prediction of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Reserve values as of December 31, 2016 are related to a single producing well in Oklahoma - the Judy well in the Prairie Grove AMI.
BOE equivalents are determined by combining barrels of oil with MCF of gas divided by six.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
The decrease attributable to divestiture of reserves is from the sale of Oklahoma properties - the Cimarron properties in second quarter, 2016.
The upward revisions of previous estimates of 54,908 Bbls and 493,013 MCF results primarily from 2016 reserve report calculations for the Company’s properties driven by industry conditions and the change in the proportional quantities of oil and gas in production from the Judy well in Oklahoma from 2015 to 2016.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, both proved and probable reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows, and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
In estimating probable reserves, it should be noted that those reserve estimates inherently involve greater risk and uncertainty than estimates of proved reserves. While analysis of geoscience and engineering data provides reasonable certainty that proved reserves can be economically producible from known formations under existing conditions and within a reasonable time, probable reserves involve less certainty than reserves with a higher classification due to less data to support their ultimate recovery. Probable reserves have not been discounted for the additional risk associated with future recovery. Prospective investors should be aware that as the categories of reserves decrease with certainty, the risk of recovering reserves at the PV-10 calculation increases. The reserves and net present worth discounted at 10% relating to the different categories of proved and probable have not been adjusted for risk due to their uncertainty of recovery and thus are not comparable and should not be summed into total amounts.

Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies
The reserve estimates, including PV-10 estimates, set forth above were prepared by PeTech Enterprises, Inc. for the Company’s properties in Oklahoma. A copy of their full reports with regard to our reserves is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K. These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.
We do not have any employees with specific reservoir engineering qualifications in the company. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer worked closely with PeTech Enterprises Inc. in connection with their preparation of our reserve estimates, including assessing the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the methods and assumptions used in this process.
PeTech Enterprises, Inc. (“PeTech”), who provided 2016 reserve estimates for our Oklahoma Properties, is a Texas based profitable, family owned oil and gas production and Investment Company that provides reservoir engineering, economics and valuation support to energy banks, energy companies and law firms as an expert witness. PeTech has been in business since 1982. Amiel David is the President of PeTech and the primary technical person in charge of the estimates of reserves and associated cash flow and economics on behalf of the company for the results presented in its reserves report to us. He has a PhD in Petroleum Engineering from Stanford University. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas (PE #50970), granted in 1982, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Proved Nonproducing Reserves
As of December 31, 2016, our proved nonproducing reserves totaled 124,733 barrels of oil equivalents (BOE) compared to 40,170 as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 84,563 BOE. These proved nonproducing reserves at December 31, 2016 were associated with our Hunton project Judy well. The change consists of a decrease of 40,170 BOE due to the sale of the Texas Marcelina properties and an increase of 124,733 BOE from the engineering analysis of the Judy well. These numbers are taken from the third party reserves study prepared by PeTech for 2016 and 2015 and CREST Engineering Services, Inc for 2015.
The net reserves change associated with these properties is a decrease of approximately 6,630 Bbls of oil and an increase of approximately 467,600 Mcf of gas calculated with a gas-oil equivalency factor of six.
We made investments and progress during 2016 to develop proved producing reserves in the Orogrande and Hazel Projects in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2016 there were no producing wells on these properties.
Our current drilling plans, subject to sufficient capital resources and the periodic evaluation of interim drilling results and other potential investment opportunities, include drilling additional wells in the Orogrande and Hazel AMI’s to continue to derisk the prospects and obtain initial production from the development efforts per our Farmout agreement with Founders in which we will be carried on all aspects of Orogrande drilling for the foreseeable future. In addition, we intend to continue to de-risk the Hazel AMI by continuing to drill evaluation wells. The next scheduled well in the Hazel Project is set for the end of June. It is intended to be a horizontal well testing the Wolfcamp formation in order to determine horizontal viability of the play.
Production, Price, and Production Cost History
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced and sold 8,488 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $34.15 per bbl. We produced and sold 36,513 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $1.77 per MCF. Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $22.54 per BOE. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $43.67 per BOE.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we produced and sold 27,981 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $46.03 per bbl. We produced and sold 113,229 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $3.00 per MCF. Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $17.38 per bbl. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $19.87 per bbl.
Our production was from properties concentrated in central Oklahoma and in south Texas. Reserves at the beginning of 2016 from each of these areas comprised more than 15% of total reserves. The Oklahoma Cimarron properties were sold on May 1, 2016 and the Marcelina properties in south Texas were sold October 1, 2016. For 2016, approximately 4,381 BOE was produced at Marcelina Creek and approximately 9,151 BOE in Oklahoma, or 30% from Marcelina Creek and 63% from Oklahoma.

Drilling Activity and Productive Wells
Marcelina Creek Project - Texas
As of December 31, 2015, we had three productive wells in the Marcelina Creek Field (2.00 net wells) and one well in the Coulter Field (.40 net well). Net wells consist of the sum of our fractional working interests in these wells.
During 2016 the Company conducted a reentry project on the Johnson #4. After an analysis of those results and the alternatives for pursuing continuing development of the Marcelina Project, a decision was made to offer the property for sale. The sale was consummated on October 1, 2016.
Central Oklahoma Projects
As of December 31, 2014, 10 wells were producing in the Cimarron, 11 wells in the Chisholm Trail, one in Prairie Grove, and one in the Viking.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company continued to produce the wells in Oklahoma but did not significantly expand development due to capital constraints and industry conditions. The production and leases in the Chisholm Trail AMI were sold in November, 2015 and the Company was actively seeking buyers for the Cimarron AMI as well. A sale of the Cimarron AMI closed effective May 1, 2016.
Having sold the Chisholm Trail and Cimarron wells and acreage, the only remaining producing wells in Oklahoma are the Judy and the Loki wells as of December 31, 2016. The Company retains ownership of the Viking, Rosedale, and Thunderbird AMI’s at December 31, 2016. Reference the detailed Leasehold Interest table included in this report.

Orogrande
On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we issued 868,750 shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a total of $100,000 in geologic origination fees to third parties. Additionally, Mr. McCabe has, at his option, a 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a participation and development agreement. All drilling obligations through December 31, 2016 have been met. Closing of the transactions occurred on September 23, 2014.
Of the 168,000 acres, 40,154 were scheduled for renewal in December, 2014. The Company renewed the leases for the 40,154 acres during second quarter, 2015. Prior to March 31, 2015, the Company had the obligation to begin drilling its first well in order to hold the acreage block. The Rich A-11 well was permitted and spudded and drilling began as required by March 31, 2015.
The Company finalized an agreement to sell a 5% working interest in the Orogrande acreage on June 30, 2015 with an effective date of April 1, 2015. Sale proceeds were $500,000 which were received in April, 2015. In addition, the Company issued 250,000 three year warrants with an exercise price of $.50 to the purchaser.
On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“HOC”), entered into a Farmout Agreement by and between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP (“Pandora”), Founders Oil & Gas, LLC (“Founders”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes) for the entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The Farmout Agreement provides for Founders to earn from HOC and Pandora (collectively, the “Farmor”) an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by Founder’s spending a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the next two years. Founders is to pay Farmor a total cost reimbursement of $5,000,000 in multiple installments as follows: (1) $1,000,000 at the signing of the Farmout Agreement, the balance of which was received on September 24, 2015; (2) within 90 days from the closing, Founders will frac and complete the Rich A-11 No. 1 Well; and (3) within five days of the spudding of each of the next eight wells drilled by Founders, Founders will pay to Farmor $500,000 resulting in the payment of the remaining amount; provided that, in the event that within 90 days after the fracing of the Rich Well, Founders notifies Farmor of its election not to drill any additional wells, Founders shall have no further obligation to make further payment.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Upon payment of the first $1,000,000, Farmor assigned to Founders an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest and a 37.5% net revenue interest in the leases subject to the terms of the Farmout Agreement (including obligations to re-assign to HOC and Pandora if the 50% interest in the entire Orogrande Project is not earned) and a proportionate share of the McCabe 10% BIAPO (back in after pay out) interest; provided, however, that for each well that Founders drills prior to earning the acreage, it will be assigned a 50% working interest in the wellbore and in the lease on which it sits.
Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610 - 1989 Model Form Operating Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures) (“JOA”) also entered into on September 23, 2015, Founders is designated as operator of the leases. Any variance to the operating plan will be determined by a Development Committee, which committee is made up of members from Founders and Farmor, or their designees, to discuss and recommend the location of the drill wells, data to be gathered and the form of same. As contemplated under the Farmout Agreement, starting within 90 days of the completion of the fracing on the Rich A-11 Well, and at all times subject to the 90 day continuous drilling clause, Founders has the option, but not the obligation, to retain the assigned interest as follows: (1) if Founders spends a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations while maintaining compliance with the continuous drilling clause, subject to reasonable delays resulting from reasonable Force Majeure conditions, Founders will have fulfilled its farmout obligations and will be entitled to retain the assigned interests. If Founders does not meet such obligations, it will reassign to Farmor the assigned interest except it will be entitled to retain its interest in the leases covering all wells drilled by Founders and the sections in which such wells are located. Additionally, Founders will resign as operator of the JOA as to all lands reassigned; and (2) Farmor will be carried in all drilling operations during the first two years and/or $45 million in drilling operations, whichever comes last, subject to Founders’ right to recoup certain expenses on “Gap Wells.” After three years and after Founders has earned its working interest, either party may elect to market the acreage as an entire block, including operatorship. Should an acceptable bid arise, and both parties agree, the block will be sold 100% working interest to that third party bidder. However, if only one party wants to accept the outside offer, the other party (the party who wishes not to sell) has the right to purchase the working interest from the selling party.
The Rich A-11 well that was drilled by Torchlight in second quarter, 2015 was evaluated and numerous scientific tests were performed to provide key data for the field development thesis. During the testing process a poor cement bond was identified preventing a cost effective production test for the primary pay zones. Repair to the well bore necessary for a subsequent frac procedure was determined to be economically unfeasible. With the Rich A-11 designed as a test well rather than commercial target, a decision to begin plans for drilling the next well(s) with larger casing that utilized for future commercial production was made.
Torchlight Energy and Founders have elected to move forward on planning the next phase of drilling in the Orogrande Project. The project operator planned to permit three new wells in 2016 starting with the University Founders B-19 #1 well. The new wells would be drilled vertically for test purposes and would have sufficient casing size to support lateral entry into any pay zone(s) encountered once the well is tested vertically. Torchlight and the project operator would then run a battery of tests on each well to gain information for future development of the field. The second test well, the University Founders B-19 #1, was spudded on April 24, 2016 and drilled in second quarter, 2016. The well successfully pumped down completion fluid in third quarter and indications of hydrocarbons were seen at the surface on this second Orogrande Project test well. Despite encountering a bedding plane in a small section of the wellbore which required the installation of a pump to dewater, fluids from the B-19 #1 test well have begun to show an oil cut. The oil samples appear to be to be very high gravity in the 45° to 47° API range. The well has shown casing pressure measured from 200 psi to 540 psi at various times during the testing phase. The presence of natural gas is also noted and samples have been taken showing a ~1050 BTU content.
The parties have agreed to amend the drilling schedule for the next well to be no later than April 30, 2017. Future plans are focused on drilling additional wells in the Orogrande per our Farmout agreement with Founders in which we will be carried on costs for all aspects of drilling for the foreseeable future.
Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
Effective April 1, 2016, Torchlight Energy Inc. acquired from McCabe Petroleum Corporation, a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin in exchange for 1,500,000 warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 for five years and a back-in after payout of a 25% working interest to the seller.
Initial development of the first well on the property, the Flying B Ranch #1, began July 10, 2016 and development continued through September 30, 2016. This well was is classified as a test well in the development pursuit of the Hazel Project.
In October, 2016, the holders of the Company's Series C Preferred shares (which were issued in July, 2016) elected to convert into a 33.33% Working Interest in the Company's Hazel Project, reducing Torchlight's ownership from 66.66% to a 33.33% Working Interest.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
On December 27, 2016, drilling activities commenced on its next Midland Basin, Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #2. The well will be a vertical test similar to the Company's first Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #1. We intend to continue to de-risk the Hazel AMI by continuing to drill evaluation wells. The next scheduled well in the Hazel Project is set for the end of June, 2017. It is intended to be a horizontal well testing the Wolfcamp formation in order to determine horizontal viability of the play.
In November, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a Letter of Intent to increase its ownership across all 12,000 gross acres in the Hazel Project resulting in 8,880 net acres in its Midland Basin Hazel Project. Upon closing of the transactions in January, 2017 contemplated by the Letter of Intent, Torchlight obtained the additional 40.66% Working Interest from an entity owned and controlled by its Chairman, Greg McCabe, increasing Torchlight's total ownership to 74%. Reference “Subsequent Events” in Note 11 to the financial statements included in this report.
