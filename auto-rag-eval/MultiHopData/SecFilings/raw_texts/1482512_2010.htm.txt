Item 2. Properties
As of December 31, 2010, our stabilized portfolio consisted of 12 wholly-owned properties and a 51% consolidated joint venture investment in Rincon Center, located in eight California submarkets, containing a total of approximately 4.0 million square feet, which we refer to as our portfolio. The following table presents an overview of our portfolio, based on information as of December 31, 2010. Rental data presented in the table below for office properties reflects annualized base rent on leases in place as of December 31, 2010 and does not reflect actual cash rents historically received because such data does not reflect abatements or tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses. Rental data presented in the table below for media and entertainment properties reflects actual cash base rents, excluding tenant reimbursements, received during the 12 months ended December 31, 2010. Leases at our media and entertainment properties
are typically short-term leases of one year or less, and other than the KTLA lease at our Sunset Bronson property, substantially all of the current in-place leases at our media and entertainment properties will expire in 2011 and 2012.
All of our properties are located in California, and are owned through our operating partnership.
The following table sets forth certain information relating to each of the stabilized office and media and entertainment properties owned as of December 31, 2010.
(1)
Square footage for office and media and entertainment properties has been determined by management based upon estimated leasable square feet, which may be less or more than the Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA, rentable area. Square footage may change over time due to remeasurement or releasing. Square footage for land assets represents management’s estimate of developable square feet, the majority of which remains subject to receipt of entitlement approvals that have not yet been obtained.
(2)
Percent leased for office properties is calculated as (i) square footage under commenced leases as of December 31, 2010, divided by (ii) total square feet, expressed as a percentage. Percent leased for media and entertainment properties is the average percent leased for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the short-term nature of the leases into which we enter at our media and entertainment properties, and because entertainment industry tenants generally do not shoot on weekends due to higher costs, we believe stabilized occupancy rates at our media and entertainment properties are lower than those rates achievable at our traditional office assets, where tenants enter into longer-term lease arrangements.
(3)
We present rent data for office properties on an annualized basis, and for media and entertainment properties on an annual basis. Annualized base rent for office properties is calculated by multiplying (i) base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)) for the month ended December 31, 2010, by (ii) 12. Annual base rent for media and entertainment properties reflects actual base rent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, excluding tenant reimbursements.
(4)
Annualized base rent per leased square foot for the office properties is calculated as (i) annualized base rent divided by (ii) square footage under lease as of December 31, 2010. Annual base rent per leased square foot for the media and entertainment properties is calculated as (i) actual base rent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, excluding tenant reimbursements, divided by (ii) average square feet under lease for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010.
(5)
As of December 31, 2010, we owned a 51% joint venture interest in the Rincon Center property. On February 24, 2011, we exercised our call right
to purchase the remaining 49% interest at a purchase price of approximately $40.3 million, which includes an allocation of the net current assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011.
Office Portfolio
Our portfolio consists of 11 office properties (including our Rincon Center joint venture interest) comprising an aggregate of approximately 3.1 million square feet. As of December 31, 2010, our office properties were approximately 87.7% leased to approximately 171 tenants (or 88.0% leased, giving effect to leases signed but not commenced as of that date). All of our office properties are located in prime California submarkets. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average remaining lease term for our office portfolio was 58 months.
Tenant Diversification of Office Portfolio
Our office portfolio is currently leased to a variety of companies. The following table sets forth information regarding the 10 largest tenants in our office portfolio based on annualized base rent as of December 31, 2010.
(1)
The AIG, GSA - U.S. Corps of Engineers, Saatchi & Saatchi North America, Inc. and State of California leases are subject to early termination prior to expiration at the option of the tenant.
(2)
Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying (i) base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)) for the month ended December 31, 2010, by (ii) 12. Annualized base rent does not reflect tenant reimbursements.
(3)
Bank of America lease expiration by square footage: (1) 28,574 square feet at December 31, 2011; (2) 25,474 square feet at December 31, 2012; (3) 236,522 square feet at December 31, 2013; (4) 331,197 square feet at December 31, 2015; and (5) 213,882 square feet at December 31, 2017.
(4)
AIG lease expiration by square footage: (1) 3,332 square feet at May 31, 2011; (2) 166,757 square feet at July 31, 2017.
Lease Distribution of Office Portfolio
The following table sets forth information relating to the distribution of leases in our office portfolio, based on net rentable square feet under lease as of December 31, 2010.
_____________
(1)
Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying (i) base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)), including under uncommenced leases for the month ended December 31, 2010 by (ii) 12. Annualized base rent does not reflect tenant reimbursements.
Lease Expirations of Office Portfolio
The following table sets forth a summary schedule of the lease expirations for leases in place as of December 31, 2010 plus available space, for each of the ten full calendar years beginning January 1, 2010 at the properties in our office portfolio. Unless otherwise stated in the footnotes, the information set forth in the table assumes that tenants exercise no renewal options and all early termination rights.
____________
(1)
Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying (i) base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)), including under uncommenced leases for the month ended December 31, 2010, by (ii) 12. Annualized base rent does not reflect tenant reimbursements.
Media and Entertainment Portfolio
Our portfolio of operating properties includes two properties that we consider to be media and entertainment properties, encompassing an aggregate of 857,432 square feet. We define our media and entertainment properties as those properties in our portfolio that are primarily used for the physical production of media content, such as television, feature films, commercials, music videos and photographs. These properties generally also feature a traditional office component that is leased to production companies and content providers. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, our media and entertainment properties were approximately 72.6% leased. Our media and entertainment properties are located in prime
Southern California submarkets.
Leasing Characteristics of Media and Entertainment Properties
The duration of typical lease terms for tenants of media and entertainment properties tends to be shorter than those of traditional office properties. Generally, terms of the media and entertainment leases are one year or less, as tenants are never certain as to whether their productions will continue to be carried by networks or cable channels. However, historically, many entertainment tenants have exercised renewal options such that their actual tenancy is extended for multiple years. As an example, productions such as Judge Judy, Judge Joe Brown, Family Feud and Hannah Montana have been tenants at Sunset Bronson Studios for between three and 12 years. At Sunset Gower Studios, NBC’s Heroes was a tenant for four years prior to its cancellation and Showtime’s Dexter has been a tenant for three years. Additionally, occupancy levels for sound stage space and office and support space tend to run in parallel, as a majority of stage users also require office and support
space. In addition, we require tenants at our media and entertainment properties to use our facilities for items such as lighting, equipment rental, parking, power, HVAC and telecommunications (telephone and internet). As a result, our other property-related revenues tend to track overall occupancy of our media and entertainment properties. As a result of the short-term nature of the leases into which we enter at our media and entertainment properties, and because entertainment industry tenants generally do not shoot on weekends due to higher costs, we believe stabilized occupancy rates at our media and entertainment properties are lower than those rates achievable at our traditional office assets, where tenants enter into longer-term lease arrangements.
Description of Our Media and Entertainment Properties
Sunset Gower, Hollywood, California
Sunset Gower is a 15.6 acre media and entertainment property located in the heart of Hollywood, four blocks west of the Hollywood (101) Freeway. The property encompasses almost an entire city block, bordered by Sunset Boulevard to the north, Gower Street to the west, Gordon Street to the east and Fountain Avenue to the south. The property, a fixture in the Los Angeles-based entertainment industry since it was built in the 1920s, served as Columbia Pictures’ headquarters through 1972 and is now one of the largest independent media and entertainment properties in the United States. Sunset Gower provides a fully-integrated environment for its media and entertainment-focused tenants within which they can access creative and technical talent for film and television production and post-production. Sunset Gower typically serves as home to single camera television and motion picture production tenants. The property is comprised of 368,149 square feet of office and support space, along with 12 sound stage facilities totaling 175,560 square feet. In addition, there are 1,450 parking spaces (situated in both surface and structured parking lots). Included in the total office square feet is a building, known as 6060 Sunset, which is comprised of approximately 17,000 square feet and was purchased separately from the Sunset Gower property and completely renovated, including core and shell upgrades. The renovation was completed in October 2009 and we believe that this space will be well suited for longer term media and entertainment tenants. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Sunset Gower was approximately 70.9% leased.
Approximately 0.59 acres of the site is subject to a ground lease held by SGS Holdings, LLC pursuant to a lease dated August 26, 1949 between Elizabeth K. Chadwick, as lessor, and SGS Holdings (as successor-in-interest to Columbia Pictures Corporation), as lessee (expiring March 31, 2060); the remaining portion of the Sunset Gower property is owned by SGS Holdings in fee, with the exception of 6060 Sunset, which is owned by SGS Realty II, LLC.
In addition to Sunset Gower’s existing facilities, the current zoning designation for Sunset Gower, M1-1-Limited Industrial, City of Los Angeles, permits a floor area ratio, or FAR, of 1.5x, which implies a maximum allowable density of 1,022,933 square feet, or an incremental 423,436 square feet above the existing 599,497 floor area ratio, including the Technicolor Building. However, as of December 31, 2010, we had no immediate plans to develop additional facilities on the property.

Sunset Gower Percent Leased and Base Rent
The following table sets forth the percentage leased, annual base rent per leased square foot and annual net effective base rent per leased square foot for Sunset Gower as of the dates indicated below:
_____________
(1)
Percent leased is the average percent leased for the 12 month period ended as of each of the respective measurement dates indicated above. As a result of the short-term nature of the leases into which we enter at our media and entertainment properties, and because entertainment industry tenants generally do not shoot on weekends due to higher costs, we believe stabilized occupancy rates at our media and entertainment properties are lower than those rates achievable at our traditional office assets, where tenants enter into longer-term lease arrangements.
(2)
Annual base rent per leased square foot is calculated as actual base rent, excluding tenant reimbursements, for the 12 month period ended as of each of the respective measurement dates indicated above divided by average square feet under lease for the 12 month period ended as of each of the respective measurement dates indicated above.
(3)
Annual net effective base rent per leased square foot represents (i) actual base rent, excluding tenant reimbursements, for the 12 month period ended as of each of the respective measurement dates indicated above, calculated on a straight-line basis to amortize free rent periods and abatements, but without regard to tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, divided by (ii) the average square feet under lease for the 12 month period ended as of each of the respective measurement dates indicated above.
On February 11, 2011, we closed a five-year term loan totaling $92.0 million with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. secured by our Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson media and entertainment campuses. Proceeds from the loan were used to fully refinance the $37.0 million mortgage loan secured by our Sunset Bronson campus that was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2011. The remaining proceeds were used to partially pay down our $200 million secured credit facility. Sunset Gower was removed from the portfolio of properties that secure our secured revolving credit facility in connection with the closing on this term loan.
Sunset Bronson, Hollywood, California
Sunset Bronson is a 10.6 acre media and entertainment property located in the heart of Hollywood, one block west of the Hollywood (101) Freeway and in close proximity to the Sunset Gower property. The property encompasses a full city block, bordered by Sunset Boulevard to the north, Bronson Avenue to the west, Van Ness Avenue to the east and Fernwood Avenue to the south. The property, which was built in phases from 1924 through 1981, formerly served as Warner Brothers Studios’ headquarters and has been continuously operated as a media and entertainment property since the 1920s. The property includes a Historical-Cultural Monument designation for the Site of the Filming of the First Talking Film (The Jazz Singer) that is specific to the building structure that fronts Sunset Boulevard. Similar to nearby Sunset Gower, Sunset Bronson is a multi-use property with a full complement of production, post-production and support facilities that enable its media and entertainment focused tenants to conduct their business in a collaborative and efficient setting. In contrast to Sunset Gower, which typically serves single camera television and motion picture productions, Sunset Bronson caters to multi-camera television productions, such as game shows, talk shows or courtroom shows that record in video and require a control room to manage and edit the productions’ multiple cameras. Excluding the KTLA portion of the property, which is described below,
Sunset Bronson consists of approximately 86,108 square feet of office and support space and nine sound stage facilities with approximately 137,109 square feet, along with 455 parking spaces. The property has three digital control rooms, one of which has high-definition technology, which allow tenants to edit productions filmed with high-definition cameras. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, Sunset Bronson was approximately 75.5% leased.
Sunset Bronson also includes the KTLA facility, which is a multi-use office, broadcasting and production facility located on the Sunset Bronson property described above. The KTLA facility is 100% leased by KTLA Channel 5, one of the largest independent television stations in Los Angeles and has served as KTLA’s only broadcast facility and its primary office and production location for over 50 years. In connection with the acquisition of the Sunset Bronson property, KTLA, Inc., a subsidiary of Tribune Company, entered into a five-year lease for approximately 90,506 square feet, which includes 83,531 square feet of office and support space and 6,975 square feet encompassing two sound stages. At the time of the closing of the acquisition of the Sunset Bronson property, our predecessor received a prepayment of $16.3 million from KTLA in prepayment of its rents for the initial five-year term of its lease. On December 8, 2008, Tribune Company and several of its affiliates, including KTLA, Inc., filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On June 25, 2009, KTLA assumed its lease for the KTLA facility and cured all outstanding pre-petition amounts due us.
We have entered into an amendment to the KTLA lease that extends the lease term through January 31, 2016. Net rents will be approximately $2,707,940 from February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014, $2,789,178 from February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015 and $2,872,853 from February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016.
In addition to Sunset Bronson’s existing facilities, the current zoning designation for Sunset Bronson, M1-1-Limited Industrial, City of Los Angeles, permits a FAR of 1.5x, which implies a maximum allowable density of 689,565 square feet or an incremental 391,836 square feet above the existing 297,729 total FAR, including the KTLA portion of the property.

The remaining proceeds were used to partially pay down our $200 million secured credit facility.
Sunset Bronson Lot A
In connection with our acquisition of Sunset Bronson in 2008, we acquired a 67,381 square foot undeveloped lot located on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue. The lot is located two blocks west of the I-101 Freeway, in between the Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson properties. The site is currently used as a surface parking lot and can be developed to include up to 60,855 square feet of retail and office space based on current zoning, with the opportunity to add additional developable square footage through certain municipal land entitlement approvals. We estimate that with further entitlements, we could increase the developable square footage to approximately 273,913 square feet. The lot also includes a signage take down credit that allows for a 2,496 square foot supergraphic sign to be placed on the property, conditioned upon approval by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. While we are holding this property for its development potential, we do not currently have any plans for its development.
