Drovers Bancshares Corporation has no set rollover policy. Many of our loans are made on a short-term basis with full intention of renewal at time of maturity. All loans, however, are reviewed on a continual basis for creditworthiness. Should a loan become questionable or approach problem loan status, it then undergoes a formal review process by all appropriate levels of authority.

NONACCRUAL, RESTRUCTURED LOANS AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS
The following table shows loans on nonaccrual status or loans which have been restructured for the past five years:

Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of net loans increased from 0.18% in 1994 to 0.37% at December 31, 1995. An increase in nonaccrual loans secured by 1-4 family residential mortgages accounted for most of the change, increasing from $246,000 at December 31, 1994 to $651,000 at the end of 1995. These loans are typically well secured. Charge-offs in this category have been low, as can be seen on the Analysis of Reserve for Possible Loan Losses on the following page. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans continues to be well below the Corporation's peer group average of 0.81% as reported September 30, 1995. Restructured loans consists mainly of a single commercial loan, well collateralized by real estate, and performing in compliance with the modified terms.
The following table presents the changes in the balance of other real estate over the past five years:

Drovers Bancshares Corporation manages the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio through various control processes. Risk is further controlled through the application of lending procedures such as the holding of adequate collateral, contractual guarantees, and compensating balances.
Management also considers the amount of recent and expected charge-offs, the loan portfolio mix and changes in the economy when determining the provision for loan losses. Management believes these procedures provide adequate assurance against losses and the level of the Reserve for Possible Loan Losses is sufficient to meet any present or potential risks.
