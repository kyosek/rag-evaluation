Hudson occupies the former clubhouse of the American Women’s Association, which was originally constructed in 1929 by J.P. Morgan’s daughter. The hotel, which is only a few blocks away from Columbus Circle, Time Warner Center and Central Park, was designed by Philippe Starck to offer guests affordable luxury and style.

We own 100% of Hudson, which is part of a property that is structured as a condominium, in which Hudson constitutes 96% of the square footage of the entire building. Hudson has a total of 920 rooms, including 115 single
room occupancies (SROs), of which 31 are vacant. SROs are single room dwelling units. Each SRO is for occupancy by a single eligible individual. The unit need not, but may, contain food preparation or sanitary facilities, or both. SROs remain from the prior ownership of the building and we are by statute required to maintain these long-term tenants, unless we get their consent, as long as they pay us their rent. The hotel is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
Since 2000, we have leased our interests in Hudson to Hudson Leaseco LLC, an entity in which we owned a 0.1% membership interest, under a 35-year lease. The remaining 99.9% membership interest was owned by Chevron TCI, Inc. The lease to Hudson Leaseco allowed for the pass-through of tax credits to Chevron TCI, which used the tax credits on a current basis. In September 2006, the Company purchased 99.99% (as calculated in accordance with the purchase agreement and the operating agreement between the parties) of Chevron TCI’s interest and intends to acquire the remaining .01% in 2008. Because we receive the majority of the cash flow under the lease, Hudson Leaseco is consolidated for accounting purposes.
