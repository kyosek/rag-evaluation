ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
PRIMARY EXPLORATION PROVINCES
Brigham's exploration activities are concentrated primarily in three core provinces: the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; the onshore Gulf Coast of south Texas and Louisiana; and West Texas. Brigham is accelerating 3-D seismic activity in the Anadarko Basin and the Gulf Coast and will continue such activity in those geologic trends of the West Texas region where it has achieved its best results historically. Brigham is focusing its 3-D seismic exploration efforts in provinces where it believes 3-D technology may be effectively applied and that the Company believes offer relatively large potential reserve volumes per well and per field, high potential production rates and multiple producing objectives.
Although the Company is acquiring 3-D seismic data within the provinces listed below and has identified approximately 800 potential drilling locations yet to be drilled in those provinces, there can be no assurance that any of the seismic data will be acquired or will generate additional drilling locations or that any potential drilling locations will be drilled at all or within the expected time frame. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any well, including those currently budgeted, will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the results of exploration efforts and the review and analysis of the seismic data, (ii) the availability of sufficient capital resources by the Company and other participants for drilling prospects, (iii) economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews, (iv) the financial resources and results of the Company and (v) the availability of leases on reasonable terms and permitting for the potential drilling location. There can
be no assurance that the budgeted wells will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil.

(2) Colorado, Kansas and Montana.
Anadarko Basin. The Anadarko Basin is a prolific natural gas province that the Company believes has been relatively under explored, particularly with regard to deep, high potential objectives. The Anadarko Basin contains numerous historically elusive stratigraphic targets, such as the Red Fork, Morrow and Springer channel sands, and structural targets, such as the Hunton and Arbuckle carbonates, which are well-suited to 3-D seismic imaging. In some cases, these objectives have produced in excess of 30 Bcf of natural gas from a single well at rates up to 30 MMcf of natural gas per day.
The Company has assembled an extensive digital data base in this province, including geologic studies, basin wide geologic tops, production data, well data, geographic data and over 8,400 miles of 2-D seismic data. Working with its team of in-house geologists and supplemented by consulting geologists, the Company's explorationists integrate this data with their extensive expertise and knowledge base to generate 3-D projects in the Anadarko Basin.
Following its initial 3-D seismic acquisition in the province in 1991 (12.5 square miles), the Company acquired 51 square miles of 3-D seismic in 1993. Over the last several years the Company has accelerated its activity in the Anadarko Basin, acquiring 151 square miles of 3-D seismic in 1994, 195 square miles in 1995, 457 square miles in 1996 and 648 square miles in 1997. The Company retained a 66% average working interest in the 3-D seismic data it acquired in this province in 1997. The Company believes its increased level of activity in the Anadarko Basin will be a significant factor in the Company's growth.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had acquired or was acquiring 1,515 square miles (969,600 acres) in 30 projects in the Anadarko Basin. The Company anticipates acquiring 547 square miles (350,080 acres) of additional 3-D seismic data in this province in 1998. As of December 31, 1997, Brigham had completed 44 wells in 55 attempts (80% success rate) in the Anadarko Basin and had found cumulative proved reserves of 38.2 net Bcfe and had acquired 21.5 net Bcfe of proved reserves. In 1997, the Company completed 19 wells in 23 attempts in its Anadarko Basin province with an average working interest of 39%, adding 28.1 net Bcfe of proved reserves. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 364 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the Anadarko Basin, of which the Company intends to drill 52 gross (20.8 net) wells in 1998.
Brigham's Anadarko Basin activity provides a blend of intermediate depth, moderate risk objectives and deeper, higher potential, but somewhat higher risk objectives. The intermediate depth targets at 9,000 to 13,000 feet have provided Brigham with good drilling results to date. These include the Upper Morrow channel sands and the Lower Morrow shallow marine sands of the Texas Panhandle, the Springer channels of the Watonga Chikasha trend of western Oklahoma, and structural traps in the Hunton carbonates of the northeastern portion of the Anadarko Basin.
Intermediate depth objectives in the Anadarko Basin can provide significant reserve additions, as evidenced by Brigham's Lower Morrow discovery in its Pistol Pete 3-D Project. The Company's largest
discovery to date, the Brigham-operated Christopher 84 #1, was completed in one of four apparently productive Lower Morrow zones at approximately 12,000 feet, and initially tested at 2.65 MMcfe per day with a flowing tubing pressure of 1,800 pounds per square inch. Brigham owns a 36.4% working interest in the well and plans to drill two development wells in 1998 in which the Company will own an average 63.7% working interest. Estimated reserves for this discovery and the two development wells are 35.6 gross Bcfe, or 16.1 Bcfe net to Brigham.
The deeper Anadarko Basin objectives provided Brigham's second largest discovery to date, the Brigham operated Weise 28 #1 in its Jayhawk 3-D Project in Wheeler County, Texas. This well represents Brigham's first significant Hunton formation discovery. Drilled to a total depth of approximately 14,800 feet, the Weise 28 #1 tested at a calculated open flow rate of 128 MMcfe per day and tested an initial production rate of 6.1 MMcfe per day. A development well will be drilled on this discovery early in 1998. The Weise 28 #1 and its offset are estimated to contain proved reserves of approximately 16 gross Bcfe, or 4.3 Bcfe net to Brigham. Brigham plans to drill several higher potential tests in the deeper portions of the Anadarko Basin primarily in the Texas Panhandle and far western Oklahoma in 1998.
On November 12, 1997, Brigham acquired an interest in producing properties and undeveloped acreage at the northern end of the Carter Knox anticline in Grady County, Oklahoma (the "Chitwood Acquisition"). For $13.5 million, Brigham acquired estimated net proved reserves totaling 21.3 Bcfe and received a 50% working interest in 3,600 net acres of leasehold and 750 net mineral acres in the Chitwood Acquisition. The properties were acquired from Mobil Oil Corporation through Ward Petroleum Corporation ("Ward"), and Ward will act as drilling operator. In 1998, Brigham and Ward plan to shoot a 30 square mile 3-D seismic program over the area to delineate opportunities in the Springer, Big Four, Bromide and Arbuckle formations. The Chitwood Acquisition overlaps and is adjacent to Brigham's West Bradley 3-D Project, where Ward operates the majority of the drilling operations.
Gulf Coast. The onshore Gulf Coast region of south Texas and Louisiana is a high potential, multi-pay province that lends itself to 3-D seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity. The Company has assembled a digital data base including geographical, production, geophysical and geological information that the Company evaluates on its CAEX workstations. Working with consulting regional geologists the Company's explorationists integrate this data with their extensive expertise and knowledge base to generate 3-D projects in the Gulf Coast. Brigham's commitment to this province is evidenced by the Company's staff additions, the opening of its Houston office and the addition of ten new 3-D seismic projects in 1996 and 1997.
The Company anticipates that its increased project assemblage and 3-D seismic acquisition activity in the Gulf Coast will generate accelerated drilling in this province in 1998 and 1999. The Company is currently assembling projects in the Expanded Wilcox, Expanded Vicksburg and Yegua trends in South Texas, the Miocene trend in South Texas and South Louisiana, and the Lower and Middle Frio trends of South Texas.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had acquired or was acquiring 566 square miles (362,240 acres) of 3-D seismic data in seven projects in the onshore Gulf Coast province. The Company anticipates acquiring 393 square miles (251,520 acres) of additional 3-D seismic data in this province in 1998. As of December 31, 1997, Brigham had completed 8 wells in 11 attempts (73% success rate) in the Gulf Coast and had found cumulative proved reserves of 2.9 net Bcfe. In 1997, the Company completed seven wells in 10 attempts with an average working interest of 9% adding 2.9 net Bcfe of proved reserves. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 110 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the Gulf Coast province, of which the Company intends to drill 17 gross (8.2 net) wells in 1998.
Brigham initiated its Gulf Coast effort in 1995 with the Esperson Dome Project in Liberty County, Texas where the Company and its participants currently control approximately 9,600 gross (7,500 net) acres through leases and farmouts and have acquired 39 square miles of seismic data. The Esperson Dome Project targets structurally trapped sands in the Miocene, Vicksburg and Yegua/Cook Mountain series ranging in depth from 1,200 feet to 10,000 feet on a complexly faulted salt dome feature. Ten wells have been drilled in the project to date (one Miocene, three Yegua/Cook Mountain and six Vicksburg) yielding seven discoveries. Brigham
currently maintains a small net profits interest in the Esperson Dome Project that will convert to a variable back-in working interest of 12% to 20% in the project after payout.
Brigham's Welder Ranch and Caliente projects encompass an area covering more than 400 square miles in Duval and Webb counties, Texas. Initially Brigham participated in the acquisition of 48 square miles of 3-D seismic data over the Welder Cabeza Ranch, where the Company controls a 100% working interest in a seismic option on approximately 17,000 acres. The first well in the project, the Brigham-operated Welder-State 212 #1, in which Brigham owns an 80% working interest, was completed in February 1998, and tested naturally at a rate of 2.75 MMcf per day from the Lower Wilcox formation at 13,350 feet. Brigham currently plans to drill four additional wells in this project in 1998. The Caliente Project is a non-proprietary seismic program that covers an additional 362 square miles on which seismic data is currently being acquired. Brigham has interpreted virtually all of the data covering the Welder Ranch Project and approximately 25% of the data covering the Caliente Project, and has three exploratory wells budgeted in this project for 1998.
Another project in South Texas is Brigham's Diablo Project covering approximately 4,000 acres in Brooks County, Texas. The Company acquired 25 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic in 1997 and plans to shoot an additional 33 square miles in 1998. Brigham recently teamed up with a major oil company that controls adjoining acreage to jointly explore on the combined acreage for potential below 10,000 feet in the Vicksburg formation. Brigham has retained a 33% working interest in this deep joint exploration project. In prospective zones above 10,000 feet, primarily the Frio, Brigham has retained a 100% working interest in its original 4,000 acre lease block. The Company plans to drill several wells in this project in 1998 to test the shallow Frio and deeper Vicksburg objectives.
In its Southwest Danbury Project in Brazoria County, Texas, Brigham is the operator of a 13,000 foot Frio test that commenced drilling late in the first quarter of 1998. Brigham retains a 46.1% working interest in this test, and plans to drill several additional wells in this project in 1998.
In May 1997, Brigham initiated its El Sauz Project with a seismic option covering approximately 94,000 acres in Willacy and Kennedy counties, Texas. The El Sauz Project is an underexplored area due north of the Willamar Field, which has produced a cumulative 350 Bcfe from the Miocene and Frio sands. Brigham expects to define Miocene and Frio sands at 6,000 to 10,000 feet, with additional potential as deep as 18,000 feet. Reserve targets range from 5 to 20 Bcf per well. A 200 square mile 3-D seismic program over this acreage will be initiated in early 1998, with initial drilling anticipated for early 1999. Brigham plans to retain a 50% to 55% working interest in this project.
Also in the Miocene/Frio trend of South Texas Brigham acquired a seismic option covering approximately 28,000 acres in the Hawkins Ranch located in Matagorda County, Texas. The Company will acquire approximately 90 square miles of new proprietary 3-D seismic to merge with 65 square miles of speculative 3-D data already in inventory. The region has potential in the shallow, nonpressured Miocene and Frio sands as well as the deeper, pressured Frio sands. Interpretation of the existing data is ongoing, with acquisition of new data scheduled to begin in April 1998. Brigham plans to retain a 50% working interest in this project.
Brigham's first significant venture into South Louisiana, its Tigre Point Project, is located in six feet of water in the transition zone off Vermilion Parish. The project consists of 44 square miles of 3-D data covering a 7,200 acre lease block in Louisiana state waters, where Brigham currently controls a 75% working interest. The project will target the same series of sands that produce in the prolific Freshwater Bayou field, located five miles to the north. An 18,000 foot Lower Miocene test is scheduled for 1998, targeting greater than 200 Bcf of unrisked potential.
West Texas. The Company's 3-D seismic drilling activity in the West Texas region has been focused in the Horseshoe Atoll, the Midland Basin and the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin and the Hardeman Basin. The Company plans to continue drilling its locations in these areas. Recently the Company initiated an exploration program in the Delaware Basin and increased its activity in portions of geologic trends that the Company believes offer greater potential for lower finding costs and higher returns, including the Ellenberger and Devonian formations of the Delaware Basin and the Fusselman formation of the Midland Basin.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had acquired or was acquiring 1,649 square miles (1,055,360 acres) in 74 projects in the West Texas region. The Company anticipates acquiring 27 square miles (17,280 acres) of additional 3-D seismic data in this province in 1998. As of December 31, 1997, Brigham had completed 180 wells in 287 attempts (63% success rate) in the West Texas province and had found cumulative proved reserves of 19.4 net Bcfe. In 1997, the Company completed 19 wells in 34 attempts with an average working interest of 45% adding 1.7 net Bcfe of proved reserves. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 302 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the West Texas region, of which the Company intends to drill 31 gross (13.2 net) wells in 1998.
One area in which the Company increased its activity is the Midland Basin, where the Company has drilled five Fusselman discoveries to date. Currently the most significant of these discoveries is the Elizabeth Rose field, with gross proved reserves estimated by the Company's independent petroleum consultants at December 31, 1997 of 1.5 MMBbls of oil. The Company has drilled five wells in this Fusselman field that were producing an aggregate of approximately 890 Bbls of oil per day in February 1998. Brigham's working interest in its five Fusselman discoveries ranges from 18.75% to 91%. In 1998 the Company has acquired 27 square miles of 3-D seismic data in three additional 3-D projects adjacent to the Elizabeth Rose field and currently retains working interests of 100% in these projects.
The Company completed three Canyon Reef discoveries during 1997 in its Discovery Project located in the Horseshoe Atoll Trend. This project, in which Brigham currently retains a working interest of 75%, targets oil producing Canyon-age reef objectives at depths of approximately 9,500 feet. The Company's three 1997 discoveries in its Discovery Project were producing an aggregate of approximately 200 Bbls of oil and 900 Mcf of natural gas per day in February 1998. Brigham plans to drill three additional wells in its Discovery Project during 1998.
Among Brigham's higher potential, higher risk projects in its West Texas province are its Buffalo and Longhorn projects, located in the Delaware Basin, in which the Company owns a 25% working interest. From two 3-D programs covering approximately 137 square miles acquired in 1996 and 1997, the Company has identified numerous potential 3-D delineated drilling locations and has leased over 6,400 gross (1,600 net) acres. These projects are surrounded by prolific production from the Devonian and Ellenberger formations at depths of 15,000 to 21,000 feet, in fields such as Evetts (approximately 600 Bcf of natural gas to date from 16 wells) and War Wink South (approximately 295 Bcf of natural gas to date from eight wells). The Company plans to spud a deep test in its Longhorn Project during 1998.
NATURAL GAS AND OIL RESERVES
The Company's estimated total net proved reserves of natural gas and oil as of December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997 and the present values attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows:
- ---------------
(1) Net of a sale by the Company in January 1996 of its interest in certain properties that accounted for 299 MMcf of natural gas and 272 MBbls of oil (1,931 MMcfe of proved reserves) as of December 31, 1995.
(2) The Present Value of Future Net Revenues attributable to the Company's reserves was prepared using prices in effect at the end of the respective periods presented, discounted at 10% per annum on a pre-tax basis. These amounts reflect the effects of the Company's hedging activities in the periods presented.
(3) The Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows prepared by the Company represents the present value of future net revenues after income taxes discounted at 10%. These amounts reflect the effects of the Company's hedging activities in the periods presented.
The average prices for the Company's reserves were $1.85 per Mcf of natural gas and $18.22 per Bbl of oil as of December 31, 1995, and $3.62 per Mcf of natural gas and $24.66 per Bbl of oil as of December 31, 1996 and $2.11 per Mcf of natural gas and $16.64 per Bbl of oil as of December 31, 1997.
In accordance with applicable requirements of the SEC, estimates of the Company's proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties (except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation). Estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues therefrom are affected by natural gas and oil prices, which have fluctuated widely in recent years. At December 31, 1997, the date as of which the Company's reserves and present value data were estimated, the prices of natural gas and oil on the NYMEX were $2.26 per MMBtu and $17.64 per Bbl, respectively. From January 1, 1998 through March 24, 1998, the price of natural gas on the NYMEX ranged from $2.00 per MMBtu to $2.38 per MMBtu and the price of oil on the NYMEX ranged from $13.21 per Bbl to $17.82 per Bbl. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. The reserve data set forth herein represents only estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers, including those used by the Company, may vary. In addition, estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production, results of future development and exploration activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and other factors. The revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. The Company's estimated proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal agency. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Risk Factors -- Uncertainty of Reserve Information and Future Net Revenue Estimates."
Estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial.
DRILLING ACTIVITIES
The Company drilled, or participated in the drilling of, the following number of wells during the periods indicated.
The Company does not own any drilling rigs, and the majority of its drilling activities have been conducted by industry participant operators or independent contractors under standard drilling contracts. Consistent with its business strategy, the Company has chosen to retain operations of an increasing number of the wells it drills and expects to continue to operate more wells in 1998.
PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND ACREAGE
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the Company's ownership interest as of December 31, 1997 in productive natural gas and oil wells in the areas indicated.
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells waiting on pipeline connection. Wells that are completed in more than one producing horizon are counted as one well. Of the gross wells reported above, none had multiple completions.
Acreage
Undeveloped acreage includes leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. A gross acre is an acre in which an interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions
thereof. The following table sets forth the approximate developed and undeveloped acreage in which the Company held a leasehold, mineral or other interest at December 31, 1997:
All the leases for the undeveloped acreage summarized in the preceding table will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless the existing leases are renewed, production has been obtained from the acreage subject to the lease prior to that date, or some other "savings clause" is implicated. The following table sets forth the minimum remaining terms of leases for the gross and net undeveloped acreage:
In addition, the Company had lease options as of December 31, 1997 to acquire an additional 254,699 acres, substantially all of which expire within one year.
VOLUMES, PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
The following table sets forth the production volumes, average prices received and average production costs associated with the Company's sale of oil and natural gas for the periods indicated.
- ---------------
(1) Reflects the results of hedging activities in the periods presented.
COSTS INCURRED
The costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities are as follows (in thousands):
Costs incurred represent amounts incurred by the Company for exploration, property acquisition and development activities. Periodically, the Company will receive reimbursement of certain costs from participants in its projects subsequent to project initiation in return for an interest in the project. These payments are described as "Proceeds from participants" in the table above.
ITEM 3.
