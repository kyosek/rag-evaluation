The Company expects that the percentage of its assets invested in mortgage loans will increase, as it has determined that in 1998 it will seek to fund or acquire mortgage loans. It may also originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of a property sale. The Company intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes in its portfolio. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. The Company may originate its own mortgage loans, as well as acquire existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes. The Company's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS - Business Plan and Investment Policy."
Types of Properties Securing Mortgage Notes. The properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1997, consisted of a shopping center, an apartment complex, a hotel, 36.3 acres of commercial land, 7 developed residential lots and a 34,847 square foot parcel of unimproved land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties securing or collateralizing mortgage loans in which the Company invests without a vote of stockholders. The Company's Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
At December 31, 1997, the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio included 5 mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $4.1 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Southeast

and Southwest regions of the continental United States and 15 loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $700,000 which are secured by collateral other than income-producing real estate. At December 31, 1997, 1% of the Company's assets were invested in notes and interest receivable (less than 1% in wraparound mortgage notes, junior and other mortgage notes).
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance) by property type and geographic region, of the properties (other than a hotel and unimproved land) that serve as collateral for the Company's outstanding mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1997. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1997 is as follows:
During 1997, $4.9 million was collected in settlement of four mortgage notes receivable and $82,000 in mortgage principal payments were received.
At December 31, 1997, less than 1% of the Company's assets were invested in mortgage notes secured by non-income-producing real estate, comprised of a first mortgage note secured by 36.3 acres of commercial land in Maumelle, Arkansas, a first mortgage note secured by 34,847 square feet of unimproved land in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and seven first mortgage notes secured by developed residential lots in Greensboro, North Carolina.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company invests in first mortgage notes, with short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the Company's general policy is to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other

obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders, participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1997.
In February 1994, the Company provided $6.7 million of purchase money financing in conjunction with the sale of 1,406 acres of land in sixteen developed residential and commercial subdivisions located in Maumelle, Arkansas, secured by a first mortgage on the properties sold. The borrower did not make the scheduled February 1995 principal and interest payments. In September 1995, the Company reached a settlement with the borrower that provided the following: (i) the payment by the borrower of $2.5 million in cash; (ii) the Company's release of all land securing the note; (iii) the Company's acceptance of a new $1.4 million note secured by 36.3 acres of commercial land, such note bore interest at 9.0% and matured in January 1996 and (iv) the Company's receipt of 700,000 shares of the borrower's capital stock, which the borrower had the option to repurchase at $5.00 per share for two years from closing. The original sale had been recorded under the cost recovery method with gain being deferred until the note was collected. With the Company's receipt of $2.5 million in cash on September 12, 1995, it recognized $1.6 million of the gain previously deferred. The $1.4 million note was not paid at maturity. The Company has reached a settlement with the borrower in an effort to correct the default. Per the settlement agreement, the borrower is to pay $17,500 per month in non-refundable fees, for five consecutive months, effective November 1997. In return the Company has agreed to delay pursuing its remedies under the note until April 1998. The Company has collected all five payments. If the borrower should not pay off the note in April 1998, the Company does not expect to incur a loss on the note as the fair value of the collateral property exceeds the nominal carrying value of the note.
In May and September 1997, the Company accepted discounted payoffs of $2.1 million and $2.8 million in settlement of two first mortgage notes receivable with principal balances of $2.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company recorded no loss on the note settlements in excess of the reserves previously established.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. A wraparound mortgage loan, sometimes called an all-inclusive loan, is a mortgage loan having an original principal balance equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan(s) plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make first mortgage loans.
The Company did not originate or acquire any wraparound mortgage loans in 1997.

Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Company's Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Company's assets. At December 31, 1997, less than 1% of the Company's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
The Company did not originate or acquire any junior mortgage loans in 1997.
Loans Secured by Collateral Other than Real Estate. In June 1992, the Company received ten notes receivable secured by collateral other than real estate in satisfaction of a $622,000 obligation to the Company. At December 31, 1997, five of the notes with a combined principal balance of $374,000 remained outstanding. The Company's investment policy precludes the origination of loans secured by collateral other than real estate.
Partnership mortgage loans. The Company owns a 60% general partner interest and IORI owns a 40% general partner interest in Nakash Income Associates ("NIA"). NIA in turn owns a wraparound mortgage note receivable, secured by a shopping center in Maulden, Missouri. In August 1997, Mountain Home Associates ("MHA"), the owner of the shopping center, refinanced the matured mortgage debt in the amount of $850,000. The Company contributed $271,000 to the partnership to payoff the existing $1.0 million mortgage. The new mortgage bears interest at a variable rate, currently 9.5% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $13,000 and matures in May 2005.
