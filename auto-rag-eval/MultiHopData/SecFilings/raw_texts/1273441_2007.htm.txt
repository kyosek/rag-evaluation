Item 2. Properties
Offices
We currently lease office space in: Calgary, Alberta; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Bogota, Colombia. The two Calgary leases expire January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2013 and cost $12,386 per month and $6,684 per month, respectively. Our two Buenos Aires, Argentina leases expire January 31, 2009 and July 15, and cost $2,117 per month and $2,467 per month, respectively. Of our three Bogota, Colombia leases, two expire in March 31, 2009 and December 2010, respectively, and one expired on February 29, 2008, with costs of $794, $30,321 and $2,774 per month respectively. The expired lease will not be replaced, as the space is replaced by the lease that expires December 2010. The properties remaining on lease are in excellent condition, and we believe that they are sufficient for our office needs for the foreseeable future.
Oil and Gas Properties-Colombia
In June 2006, we purchased Argosy Energy International L.P (“Argosy”) which was subsequently renamed Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltd. Argosy had interests in seven Exploration and Production contracts at that time, including Santana, Guayuyaco, Chaza and Mecaya in the Putumayo basin; Talora and Rio Magdalena in the Magdalena basin; and Primavera in the Llanos basin. The acquisition price included overriding royalty rights and net profits interests in the blocks that were owned by Argosy at the time of the acquisition. The Azar block in the Putumayo basin was acquired later in 2006, and the Putumayo Technical Evaluation Areas in the Putumayo basin were acquired in 2007. We relinquished the Primavera block in 2007.
Currently, the Guayuyaco, Santana and Chaza blocks are producing oil. Oil prices are defined by contract and are related to a WTI reference price. By contract, 25% of sales are denominated in Colombian pesos and 75% in US dollars. Oil is sold to Ecopetrol and is exported via the Trans-Andean pipeline.
Santana
The Santana block covers 1,119 acres and includes 15 producing wells in 4 fields - Linda, Mary, Miraflor and Toroyaco. Activities are governed by terms of a Shared Risk Contract with Ecopetrol, and we are the operator. The properties are subject to a 20% royalty and we hold a 35% interest in all fields with the exception of one well located in the Mary field, Inchiyaco, where we hold a 25.83% working interest, and a third party holds a 9.17% interest. Ecopetrol holds the remaining interest. The block has been producing since 1991. Under the Shared Risk Contract, Ecopetrol initially backed in to a 50% interest upon declaration of commerciality in 1991. In June 1996, when the field reached million barrels of oil produced, Ecopetrol had the right to back into a further 15%, which it took, for a total ownership of 65%.
The production contract expires in 2015, at which time the property will be returned to the government. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs.
In 2007, we performed remedial work on various wells and upgraded the Mary field water processing facility. For 2008, we will continue with regular field maintenance.
Guayuyaco
The Guayuyaco block covers 52,366 acres and includes the area surrounding the four producing fields of the Santana contract area. The Guayuyaco block is governed by an Association Contract with Ecopetrol, resulting in a base royalty of 8%, for production of less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day. The royalty increases in a linear fashion to 20% for production between 5,000 and 125,000 barrels of oil per day, and is stable at 20% up to production of 400,000 barrels of oil per day. For production between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil per day the rate increases again to a maximum of 25%. We are the operator and have a 35% participation interest, and our partners are a third party (35%) and Ecopetrol (30%). The Guayuyaco field was discovered in 2005. Two wells are now producing, with Guayuyaco-1 commencing production in February 2005 and Guayuyaco-2 beginning production in September 2005. A combined 2D and 3D seismic survey was acquired over the block in 2005. Ecopetrol may back-in to a 30% participation interest in any new discoveries in the block.
The contract expires in two phases: the exploration phase and the production phase. The exploration phase expired in 2005 and the production phase expires in 2027. We have completed all of our obligations in relation to the exploration phase of the contract. In March 2007, we completed drilling the Juanambu-1 exploration well and testing was completed in May 2007. Pre-commercial production began in June 2007. Ecopetrol has backed-in with a 30% participation in the discovery, leaving us with a 35% participation interest. Commerciality was granted by Ecopetrol on November 8, 2007. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs.
In we plan to drill a second well on the Juanambu discovery, as well as upgrade facilities and acquire 20 kilometers of 3D seismic, which also extends into the Chaza block.
Rio Magdalena
Argosy entered into the Rio Magdalena Association Contract with Ecopetrol in February 2002. The Rio Magdalena block covers 144,670 acres and is located approximately 75 kilometers west of Bogota, Colombia. This is an exploration block and there are no reserves at this time. We are the operator of the block. According to the terms of the exploration contract, we were committed to drill three exploration wells prior to February 2008. The first of these wells, Popa-1, was drilled in late 2006 and was subsequently plugged and abandoned after testing oil production at non-commercial rates (60 barrels per day). The drilling for the second exploration well, Caneyes-1, began in late December 2006 and the well was subsequently plugged and abandoned in February 2007. We have entered the final exploration phase, which expired February 7, 2008. The contract provides for a 60 day grace period from the date of expiry of the exploration phase in order to remedy any incomplete work commitments. One additional exploration well is planned in satisfaction of our commitment for the final exploration phase The production contract expires in 2030 at which time the property will be returned to the government. As a result, there will be no reclamation costs.
We entered into a commercial agreement with a third party on January 9, 2008 whereby the third party will fund 100% of the additional exploration well, to earn a 60% working interest in the block. The third party will only earn their 60% interest once the obligation to fully fund the exploration well is completed. We will remain operator of the property.
According to the terms of the Association Contract, Ecopetrol may back-in for a 30% participation upon commercialization, and a sliding scale royalty will apply. The base royalty rate is currently 8%, for production less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and follows the same sliding scale progression as the Guayuyaco block royalty rates.
Chaza
The Chaza block covers 80,242 acres and is governed by the terms of an Exploration and Exploitation Contract with the government agency ANH. We are the operator and hold a 50% participation interest. The discovery of the Costayaco field in the Chaza Block was the result of drilling the Costayaco-1 exploration well in the second quarter of 2007. This well commenced production in July, 2007. We completed drilling the Costayaco-2 development well on January 2, 2008, and completed casing on January 8, 2008. This well encountered the same reservoir sequences with similar good oil and gas shows as Costayaco-1. Testing of the Costayaco-2 well was completed in February, 2008 and the well bore is currently being completed for production. We commenced drilling Costayaco-3 in January 2008, and completed drilling on February 20, 2008. Costayaco-3 is currently being tested. Four further development wells are planned for 2008, along with facilities and pipeline expansion and 20 kilometers of 3D seismic, which is an extension of the 3D seismic planned for the Guayuyaco block.
The contract for this field expires in two phases. The exploration phase expires in 2011 and the production phase ends in 2032. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract. Within sixty days following the date of the return of the property, we must carry out an abandonment program to the satisfaction of ANH. In conjunction with the abandonment, we must establish and maintain an abandonment fund to ensure that financial resources are available at the end of the contract. The base royalty rate is currently 8%, for production less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and follows the same sliding scale progression as the Guayuyaco block royalty rates.
Talora
We currently hold a 20% working interest and are the operator for the Talora block. The Exploration and Exploitation Contract associated with the block was originally signed in September 2004, providing for a six year exploration period and 24 year production period. The Talora contract area covers 108,334 acres and is located approximately 75 kilometers west of Bogota, Colombia. This is an exploration block and there are currently no reserves. We commenced drilling the Laura-1 exploration well on December 27, 2006, at no cost to us, and it was subsequently plugged and abandoned in January 2007. Drilling of this well has fulfilled our commitment for the second exploration phase of the contract, which ended December 15, 2006, and which contained a 60 day grace period to remedy incomplete work commitments. The third exploration phase has begun and we have a commitment to drill one well. We entered into a commercial agreement with a third party on December 27, 2007, whereby the third party will pay 100% of our 20% interest in the next exploration well drilled on Talora, in 2008. Once this obligation is fulfilled, we will apply to ANH to have our entire 20% interest in the Talora block assigned to the third party. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract.
Primavera
The Primavera Exploration and Exploitation contract was signed May 2006. The Primavera contract area covers 359,064 acres in the Llanos basin. We were the operator and had a 15% participation interest. Chaco Resources also had a 55% participation interest. In 2007, we drilled two wells in the Primavera area at no cost to us. Both wells were dry and were plugged and abandoned. Along with our partners in the field, we decided to relinquish the contract. We have no further obligations in relation to this contract.
Mecaya
The Mecaya Exploration and Exploitation contract was signed June 2006. The Mecaya contract area covers 74,128 acres in southern Colombia, about 150 kilometers southeast of Pasto. We are the operator and currently have a 15% participation interest. The first phase was scheduled to expire June 2007; however, we received a 6 months extension due to extensive consultation required with the local indigenous population. We are currently applying to ANH to have the period extended again, as guerilla activities in the area have prevented us from meeting exploration commitments by the new December, 2007 deadline. On December 27, 2007, we entered into a commercial agreement with a third party whereby the third party will pay us $1,475,000 upon our receipt of an extended work term for the first phase of exploration. Once payment has been received, we will apply to ANH to have our entire 15% interest assigned to the third party. Work plans include 2-D seismic and reprocessing, road construction, plus re-completion of the existing Mecaya-1 well bore. Seismic acquisition began in mid February, 2008. Phase two of the exploration contract expires in 2010. The exploitation phase for this contract expires 24 years after commerciality is approved. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract.
Azar
We acquired an 80% interest in the Azar property through a farm-in in late 2006, and were obliged to pay the original owner’s 20% share of future costs, as well as our own 80% share. In mid-2007 we farmed out 50% of our interest to a third party. The third party will pay 100% of our 80% share of exploration and development costs for the first three phases of the exploration contract, and we are obliged to pay 20% of costs under our farm-in agreement. This exploration block covers 51,639 acres. We acquired 40 square kilometers of 3-D seismic at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 to assess exploitation opportunities. In 2008 we will drill one well on the property. The exploration contract expires in 2012 for this property. The exploitation phase expires 24 years after commerciality is approved. The property will be returned to the government upon expiration of the production contract. If we make a commercial discovery on the block, and produce oil, we will be obligated to perform abandonment activities, under the same conditions as those for the Chaza block.
Putumayo A&B Technical Evaluation Areas
We were awarded two Technical Evaluation Areas in the Putumayo Basin in southern Colombia in June 2007. The two Technical Evaluation Areas are located near the Orito Field, the largest oil field in the Putumayo Basin.
Putumayo West A covers an area of 230,671 hectares (570,000acres) and is held 100% by Gran Tierra. The evaluation period is 12 months, expiring August 28, 2008. During this time, we have an obligation to conduct 400 kilometres of seismic reprocessing and geologic studies. We will have a preferential right to apply for an Exploration and Exploitation contract in the area during the evaluation stage and match or improve any bid by third parties to convert all or a portion of the Technical Evaluation Area to an exploration license.
Putumayo West B covers an area of 44,111 hectares (109,000 acres) and is held 100% by Gran Tierra. The evaluation period is for 11 months. During this time, we have an obligation to conduct 100 kilometres of seismic reprocessing and geologic studies. We have begun negotiations to convert this Technical Evaluation Agreement to an Exploration and Exploitation contract in the area. If negotiations are successful, the Technical Evaluation Area will be converted to an Exploration and Exploitation contract through the ANH, and the retained acreage would be subject to the new ANH royalty/tax terms which include no additional state participation.
Oil and Gas Properties-Argentina
In September 2005, we entered Argentina through the acquisition of a 14% interest in the Palmar Largo joint venture, and a 50% interest in each of the Nacatimbay and Ipaguazu blocks. In 2006, we purchased further properties in Argentina, including the remaining 50% interest in Nacatimbay and Ipaguzau, a 50% interest in El Vinalar and 100% interests in El Chivil, Valle Morado, Surubi and Santa Victoria. Our Argentina properties are located in the Noroeste Basin in northern Argentina.
Palmar Largo
The Palmar Largo joint venture block encompasses 341,500 acres. This asset is comprised of several producing oil fields in the Noroeste Basin of northern Argentina. We own a 14% working interest in the Palmar Largo joint venture, which we purchased in September 2005. A total of 14 gross wells are currently producing. We produce good quality light oil from this field.
An exploration well was drilled in late 2005 but did not indicate commercial quantities of oil. A portion of the drilling costs for this well was factored into our purchase price for Palmar Largo. Drilling on the Ramon Lista-1001 well was completed in December 2005. Production from the well began in early February 2006 at 299 barrels per day (gross after 12% royalty) or 42 barrels per day net to us. No additional wells were drilled in the area during 2006.
The Palmar Largo block rights expire in 2017 but provide for a ten-year extension. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government.
Our work program for 2008 involves optimization of well performance and operating expenses to maximize net revenues from the property.
Nacatimbay
We acquired a 100% working interest in the Nacatimbay block through two transactions. We purchased a 50% working interest in September 2005 and we purchased the remaining 50% working interest in November 2006. Production from the Nacatimbay oil, gas and condensate field began in 1996. Three wells were drilled and one was producing until February 28, 2006, when its production was suspended due to low flow conditions. In October 2006, the suspended well was reactivated after surface facilities were upgraded and it produced for two additional months in 2006 and three months of 2007 and is currently shut-in. We continued to explore ways to optimize production in this field during 2007 and explored opportunities to re-enter the Nacatimbay 1001 well.
The Nacatimbay block rights expire in 2022 with a provision for a ten year extension if a discovery is made. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government.
Ipaguazu
We acquired a 100% working interest in the Ipaguazu block through two transactions. We purchased a 50% working interest in September 2005 and we purchased the remaining 50% working interest in November 2006. The oil and gas field was discovered in 1981 and produced approximately 100 thousand barrels of oil and 400 million cubic feet of natural gas until 2003. No producing activities are carried out in the field at this time. The Ipaguazu block covers 43,243 acres and has not been fully appraised, leaving scope for both reactivation and exploration in the future. The Ipaguazu block rights expire in 2016 with a ten year extension if a discovery is made. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government. In 2008, we plan to assess the possibility of a workover on the Ipaguazu X-1 well.
El Vinalar
We acquired a 50% working interest in the El Vinalar Block in June 2006. This acquisition added a significant new land position and a small amount of production. El Vinalar covers 248,341 acres and contains a portfolio of exploration leads and oil field enhancement opportunities. The Puesto Climaco-2 sidetrack well was successfully completed in December 2006, and began producing in January 2007.
Plans for 2008 include workovers of three wells - Puesto Climaco 3, Puesto Climaco 1 and El Vinalar 2.
The El Vinalar rights expire in 2016 with a ten year extension if a discovery is made. We do not have any outstanding work commitments. At expiry of the block rights, ownership of the producing assets will revert to the provincial government.
El Chivil, Surubi, Valle Morado, Santa Victoria
We purchased working interests in four additional properties at Chivil, Surubi, Valle Morado and Santa Victoria, in November and December 2006. These properties added to our existing portfolio of exploration and development opportunities and expanded our production base in Argentina. Farm-in partners are being sought to participate in drilling one exploration well on the Surubi block in 2008.
·
The Chivil field was discovered in 1987. Three wells were drilled; two remain in production. The field has produced 1.5 million barrels of oil to date. The contract for this field expires in 2015 with the option for a ten year extension.
·
Valle Morado was first drilled in 1989. Rights to the area were purchased by Shell in 1998, which subsequently completed a 3-D seismic program over the field and constructed a gas plant and pipeline infrastructure. Production began in 1999 from a single well, and was shut-in in 2001 due to water incursion. We are evaluating opportunities to re-establish production from the field.
·
Surubi and Santa Victoria are exploration fields and have no production history.
Oil and Gas Properties - Peru
We entered the Peruvian oil and gas industry in 2006 through the award of two frontier exploration blocks.
Blocks 122 and 128
We were awarded two exploration blocks in Peru in the last quarter of 2006 under a license contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. Block covers 1,217,651 acres and block 128 covers 2,218,389 acres. The blocks are located in the eastern flank of the Maranon Basin in northern Peru, on the crest of the Iquitos Arch. There is a 5-20%, sliding scale, royalty rate on the lands, dependent on production levels. Production less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day attracts a royalty of 5%, for production between 5,000 and 100,000 barrels of oil per day there is a linear sliding scale between 5% and 20%. Production over 100,000 barrels per day has a royalty of 20%.The exploration contracts expire in 2014 and work commitments are defined in four exploration periods spread over seven years. There is a financial commitment of $5 million over the seven years for each block which includes technical studies, seismic acquisition and the drilling of exploration wells. Acquisition of technical data through aero magnetic-gravity studies began in 2007, and is continuing through the first half of 2008. This will be followed by seismic planning work in 2008 and seismic acquisition 2009. The production contract expires in 2037.
Proved Reserves
No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in a report to any federal agency other than the SEC.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. As a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and evaluating reserves, and 100% of our reserves are audited by an independent reservoir engineering firm at least annually.
The SEC definition of proved oil and natural gas reserves, per Regulation S-X, is as follows:
·
Proved oil and natural gas reserves. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made as defined in Rule 4-10(a)(2). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions.
a)
Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (1) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water contacts, if any; and (2) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data. In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.
b)
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.
c)
Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (1) oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as “indicated additional reserves”; (2) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics, or economic factors; (3) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (4) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.
·
Proved developed reserves - Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods as defined in Rule 4-10(a)(3).
·
Proved undeveloped reserves - Proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required as defined in Rule 4-10(a)(4).
The following table sets forth our proved reserves net of all royalties and third party interests as of December 31, 2007. (all quantities in thousands of barrels of oil)
Our proved developed reserves set forth in the previous table, totaling 5.3 million barrels of oil as at December 31, 2007 consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at December 31, 2007. (all quantities in thousands of barrels of oil)
Production Revenue and Price History
Certain information concerning oil and natural gas production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2007 is set forth in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
