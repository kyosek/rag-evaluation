ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our principal executive office, located in Dallas, Texas, is approximately 66,000 square feet of leased space. We also maintain two leased telemarketing centers in the Dallas area. Our sales are conducted primarily through sales centers located at our various resorts and an off-site sales center in Irving, Texas, which opened in March 2006.
At December 31, 2005, we owned a total of 13 timeshare resorts. Each of these resorts was encumbered by various liens and security agreements at December 31, 2005 due to inventory from each resort being pledged as collateral under our inventory credit facilities with our senior lenders. See Footnote 8 - Debt, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of these credit facilities. Principal developmental activity which occurred at our Existing Resorts during 2005 and future plans are summarized below.
Continued Development of The Villages Resort. The Villages Resort, located approximately 100 miles east of Dallas, Texas, has existing units. We intend to develop approximately 84 additional units (4,368 Vacation Intervals) at this resort in the future. During 2005, we added 12 new units at this resort.

We intend to develop approximately 366 additional units (19,004 Vacation Intervals) at this resort. During 2005, we added 30 units at this resort. In addition, in December 2005 we acquired approximately 81 acres of land near this resort that we intend to newly develop in the future.
Continued Development of Hill Country Resort. Hill Country Resort, located near Canyon Lake in the hill country of central Texas between Austin and San Antonio, has 290 existing units. We intend to develop approximately 222 additional units (11,544 Vacation Intervals) at this resort. During 2005, we added 12 new units at this resort.
Continued Development of Oak N' Spruce Resort. Oak N’ Spruce Resort, located 134 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts, has 284 existing units. We intend to develop approximately 66 additional units (3,432 Vacation Intervals) at this resort in the future. During 2005, we added 12 new units at this resort.
Continued Development of Silverleaf’s Seaside Resort. Silverleaf’s Seaside Resort, located in Galveston, Texas, has 96 existing units. We intend to develop approximately 186 additional units (9,672 Vacation Intervals) at this resort. During 2005, we added 12 new units at this resort.
Continued Development of Orlando Breeze Resort. Orlando Breeze Resort, located in Davenport, Florida, just outside Orlando, Florida, has 48 existing units. We intend to develop approximately 24 additional units (1,248 Vacation Intervals) at this resort. During 2005, we did not add any new units at this resort. Our public offering statement filed with the Florida Bureau of Standards and Registrations was approved in February 2005, granting us timeshare sales approval for 16 units encompassing 832 one-week Vacation Intervals. By December 31, 2005, we were granted sales approval for all of the 48 existing units at the resort, encompassing a total of 2,496 one-week Vacation Intervals.
As of December 31, 2005, we had construction commitments of approximately $11.0 million.
In December 1998, we purchased 1,940 acres of undeveloped land near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for approximately $1.9 million. The property was intended to be developed as a Getaway Resort (i.e., Beech Mountain Resort). We received regulatory approval to develop 408 units (21,216 Vacation Intervals), but we did not schedule dates for construction, completion of initial units, or commencement of marketing and sales efforts. In 2003, we determined that we would not develop this property as initially planned. In 2005, we sold this property for an aggregate sales price of $6.1 million after related expenses, which resulted in a gain of $3.6 million.
We also own a 500-acre tract of land in the Berkshire Mountains of Western Massachusetts that we are in the initial stages of developing. We have not yet finalized our future development plans for this site; however, we believe that its proximity to major population centers in the Northeastern United States and the year-round outdoor recreational attractions in the Berkshire region make this property suitable for future development as a timeshare resort.
Future Growth Strategy
Our future growth strategy is to conservatively increase annual revenues through a combination of:
·
continuing to develop new or existing resorts;
·
maintaining marketing, sales, and development activities at those resorts in accordance with our current business model;
·
concentrating on marketing to existing members, including sales of upgraded Vacation Intervals, additional week sales, and existing owner referral programs;
·
opening new off-site sales centers in major metropolitan areas; and
·
emphasizing our secondary products, such as biennial (alternate year) intervals, to broaden our potential market with a wider price range of products for first time buyers.
Competitive Advantages
We believe our business affords us the following competitive advantages:
Convenient Getaway Locations. Our Getaway Resorts are located within a two-hour drive of a majority of our target customers' residences, which accommodates what we believe to be the growing demand for shorter, more frequent, close-to-home vacations. This proximity of our customer base to our resorts facilitates use of our Bonus Time program, allowing Silverleaf Owners to use vacant units, subject to availability and certain limitations. We believe we are the only timeshare operator that offers customers these expanded use benefits. Silverleaf Owners can also conveniently drive to and enjoy non-lodging resort amenities at our resorts year-round on a day use "country-club" type basis.
Substantial Internal Growth Capacity. At December 31, 2005, we had an inventory of 27,396 Vacation Intervals and a master plan to construct new units which will result in up to 82,028 additional Vacation Intervals at our Existing Resorts. Our master plan for construction of new units is contingent upon future sales at our Existing Resorts and the availability of financing, granting of governmental permits, and future land-planning and site-layout considerations.
In-House Operations. We have in-house marketing, sales, financing, development, and property management capabilities. While we utilize outside contractors to supplement internal resources, our internal capabilities provide greater control over all phases of our operations, help maintain operating standards, and reduce overall costs.
Lower Construction and Operating Costs. We have developed and generally employ standard architectural designs and operating procedures, which we believe significantly reduce construction and operating expenses. Standardization and integration also allow us to rapidly develop new inventory in response to demand. Weather permitting, new units at Existing Resorts can normally be constructed on an "as needed" basis within 180 to 270 days.
Centralized Property Management Supervision. We presently supervise the operation of all of our Existing Resorts (except for Orlando Breeze) on an integrated, centralized, and collective basis through our Management Agreement with Silverleaf Club with operating and maintenance costs paid from Silverleaf Owners' monthly dues. While our Orlando Breeze resort in Florida has its own separate Club (Orlando Breeze Resort Club) we also provide centralized supervision of its operations under the terms of a written agreement, to ensure the quality of services provided to Orlando Breeze timeshare owners. We believe that consolidation of resort operations benefits Silverleaf Owners by providing them with a uniform level of service, accommodations, and amenities on a standardized, cost-effective basis. Integration also facilitates our internal exchange program and the Bonus Time program.
Experienced Management. Our senior management has extensive experience in the acquisition, development, marketing, sales, and operation of timeshare resorts. The senior officers have an average of sixteen years of experience in the timeshare industry.
Resorts Summary
The following tables set forth certain information regarding each of the Existing Resorts at December 31, 2005, unless otherwise indicated.
Existing Resorts
(a)
These totals do not reflect sales of upgraded Vacation Intervals to existing Silverleaf Owners. In this context, a sale of an "upgraded Vacation Interval" refers to an exchange of a lower priced interval for a higher priced interval in which the Silverleaf Owner is given credit for all principal payments previously made toward the purchase of the lower priced interval. For the year ended December 31, 2005, upgrade sales at the Existing Resorts were as follows:
The average sales price for the 4,645 upgraded Vacation Intervals sold was $8,793 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
(b)
Represents units included in our master plan. This plan is subject to change based upon various factors, including consumer demand, the availability of financing, grant of governmental land-use permits, and future land-planning and site layout considerations. The following chart reflects the status of certain planned units at December 31, 2005:
"Land-Use Process Pending" means that we have commenced the process which we believe is required under current law in order to obtain the necessary land-use authorizations from the applicable local governmental authority with jurisdiction, including submitting for approval any architectural drawings, preliminary plats, or other attendant items as may be required.
"Land-Use Process Complete" means either that (i) we believe that we have obtained all necessary land-use authorizations under current law from the applicable local governmental authority with jurisdiction, including the approval and filing of any required preliminary or final plat and the issuance of building permit(s), in each case to the extent applicable, or (ii) upon payment of any required filing or other fees, we believe that we will under current law obtain such necessary authorizations without further process.
(c)
These totals are net of intervals received from upgrading customers and from intervals received from cancellations.
(d)
Principal amenities available to Silverleaf Owners at each resort are indicated by the following symbols: B - boating; F - fishing; G - golf; H - horseback riding; M - miniature golf; S - swimming pool; and T - tennis.
(e)
Boating is available near the resort.

Engineering, architectural, and construction estimates have not been completed, and we cannot be certain that we will develop these properties at the unit numbers currently projected.
Features Common To Existing Resorts
Getaway Resorts are primarily located in rustic areas offering Silverleaf Owners a quiet, relaxing vacation environment. Furthermore, the resorts offer different vacation activities, including golf, fishing, boating, swimming, horseback riding, tennis, and archery. Destination Resorts are located in or near areas with national tourist appeal. Features common to the Existing Resorts include the following:
Bonus Time Program. Silverleaf Club’s Bonus Time program offers Silverleaf Club members a benefit not typically enjoyed by any other timeshare owners. In addition to the right to use a unit one week per year, the Bonus Time program allows all Silverleaf Club members, who are current on their dues and installment payments, to use vacant units for up to three nights at a time at any of our owned resorts. Sunday through Thursday night stays are currently without charge, while Friday through Saturday stays presently cost $49.95 per night payable to Silverleaf Club. The Bonus Time program is limited based on the availability of units. Availability is created when a Silverleaf Owner does not use his or her owned week. Silverleaf Owners who have utilized the resort less frequently are given priority to use the program and may only use an interval with an equal or lower rating than their owned Vacation Interval. We believe this program is important as many vacationers prefer shorter two to three day vacations. Owners of unused intervals that are utilized by the Bonus Time program are not compensated other than by their participation in the Bonus Time program.
Silverleaf Plus Program. In February 2006 we began selling the new Silverleaf Plus program. This program, administered through Silverleaf Club, includes all of the prior benefits to Silverleaf Club members plus enhanced vacation options through the Silverleaf exchange program. In addition to use of their owned weeks and bonus time, Silverleaf Club members who purchase with the Silverleaf Plus program can also split their weeks into a minimum of 2-day up to 5-day increments, and extend any unused days into the following year.
Year-Round Use of Amenities. Even when not using the lodging facilities, Silverleaf Owners have unlimited year-round day usage of the amenities located at the Existing Resorts, such as boating, fishing, miniature golf, tennis, swimming, or hiking, for little or no additional cost. Certain amenities, however, such as golf, horseback riding, or watercraft rentals, may require a usage fee.
Exchange Privileges. Each Silverleaf Owner has certain exchange privileges through the Silverleaf Club which may be used on an annual basis to (i) exchange an interval for a different interval (week) at the same resort so long as the desired interval is of an equal or lower rating; or (ii) exchange an interval for the same interval (week) at any other of the Existing Resorts. These exchange rights are a convenience we provide our members as an accommodation to them, and are conditioned upon availability of the desired interval or resort. Approximately 4,455 exchanges occurred in 2005. Silverleaf Owners pay an exchange fee of $75 to Silverleaf Club for each such internal exchange. In addition, most Silverleaf Owners may join the exchange program administered by RCI for an annual fee of $89. Orlando Breeze, is not under contract with RCI; however it is under contract with Interval International, Inc., a competitor of RCI.
Deeded Ownership. We typically sell a Vacation Interval that entitles the owner to use a specific unit for a designated one-week interval each year. The Vacation Interval purchaser receives a recorded deed, which grants the purchaser a percentage interest in a specific unit for a designated week. We also sell a biennial (alternate year) Vacation Interval that allows the owner to use a unit for a one-week interval every other year with reduced dues.
Management Club. Each of the Existing Resorts has a Club for the benefit of the timeshare owners. At December 31, 2005, the Clubs (except for the club at Orlando Breeze) operate under Silverleaf Club to manage the Existing Resorts on a centralized and collective basis. We have contracted with Silverleaf Club to perform the supervisory and management functions granted by the Clubs. Costs of these operations are covered by monthly dues paid by timeshare owners to their respective Clubs together with income generated by the operation of certain amenities at each respective resort. Our new destination resort in Florida, Orlando Breeze, has its own club, Orlando Breeze Resort Club, which operates independently of Silverleaf Club; however, we supervise the management and operation of the Orlando Breeze Resort Club under the terms of a written agreement.
On-Site Security. Each of the Resorts is patrolled by security personnel who are either employees of the Management Club or personnel of independent security service companies that have contracted with the Clubs.
