      "with a 59.0% average working interest and a 50.7% average net revenue interest. We also operate 45 producing wells in the Skelly Penrose A Unit with a 100% working interest and a 86.8% net revenue interest, as well as five other properties with eight active producing wells with an average net working interest of 95.9% and 80.8% net revenue interests. As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Langlie Mattix field contained 1.5 MMBoe (88% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $40.2 million. The average net daily production from this field was 237 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for the field is 17.5 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.\nThe Langlie Mattix Penrose Sand Unit was drilled in the late 1930s and early 1940s on 40-acre spacing. Waterflooding commenced in 1958. There have been a total of 26 20-acre infill wells drilled on the Unit in four different drilling programs from 1983 to 2007. All four 20-acre infill drilling programs were successful. We have 23 more proved undeveloped locations and an additional 41 unproved 20-acre locations.\nDenton Field. The Denton field is located in Lea County, New Mexico. The Devonian Formation at depths of 11,000 to 12,700 feet is the primary reservoir in the Denton field. Additional production has been developed in the Wolfcamp Formation at depths of 8,900 to 9,600 feet. We operate 21 wells in the Denton field with working interests ranging from 86% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 75.1% to 87.5%. We also own another nine wells (seven producing, two injecting) with a 15% average non-operated working interest and a 13.1% average net revenue interest. As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Denton field contained 2.2 MMBoe (82% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $39.0 million. The average net daily production from this field was 474 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for the field is 12.6 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.\nFourbear/Fourbear Frank\u2019s Fork Fields. The Fourbear and Fourbear Frank\u2019s Fork fields are located in Park County in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. These fields produce from multiple formations which primarily include the Pennsylvanian age Phosphoria and Tensleep formations from 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Legacy operates 66 wells (41 producing, 25 injecting) in these fields with working interests ranging from 83.1% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 72.2% to 89.1%. As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Fourbear and Fourbear Frank\u2019s Fork fields contained 2.2 MMBoe (100% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $34.9 million. The average net daily production from these fields was 405 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for these fields is 15.2 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.\nWe have identified three proved undeveloped projects and seven behind-pipe or proved developed non-producing projects in these fields. We also have 10 additional unproved drilling locations in these fields.\nFarmer Field. The Farmer field is located in Crockett and Reagan Counties, Texas. The San Andres Formation at depths of 2,100 to 2,600 feet is the primary reservoir in the Farmer field. We operate 154 wells (146 producing, 8 injecting) in the Farmer field with a 100.0% average working interest and a net revenue interest ranging from 80.8% to 87.5%. As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Farmer field contained 1.8 MMBoe (66% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $30.8 million. The average net daily production from this field was 212 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for the field is 23.6 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.",
      "The Langlie Mattix Penrose Sand Unit was drilled in the late 1930s and early 1940s on 40-acre spacing. Waterflooding commenced in 1958. Prior to 2007 there had been 14 20-acre infill wells drilled on the Unit; five drilled in 1983, three drilled in 1992, and six drilled in 2004. All three 20-acre infill programs were successful. We drilled twelve 20-acre infill wells in 2007 and have 23 more proved undeveloped locations and an additional 55 unproved 20-acre locations.\nHoward Glasscock, Iatan and Iatan East Howard Fields. The Howard Glasscock, Iatan and Iatan East Howard fields adjoin one another and are located in Howard and Mitchell counties, Texas. These fields produce from multiple formations of Permian age which primarily include the San Andres, Yates, Seven Rivers, Queen, Clearfork and Glorieta Formations from 1,000 to 3,700 feet as well as the Wolfcamp and Canyon Formations from 5,100 to 7,400 feet. We operate 125 wells (115 producing, 10 injecting) in these fields with working interests ranging from 62.5% to 100.0% and net revenue interests ranging from 47.3% to 90.0%. As of December 31, 2007, our properties in the Howard Glasscock, Iatan and Iatan East Howard fields contained 1.3 MMBoe (99% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $26.7 million. The average net daily production from these fields was 208 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2007. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for these fields is 17 years.\nOil and Natural Gas Data\nProved Reserves\nThe following table sets forth a summary of information related to our estimated net proved reserves as of the dates indicated based on reserve reports prepared by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. The estimates of net proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency. Standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\n(a)\nIncludes 3.2 MMBbls of oil, 13.0 Bcf of natural gas and $93.0 million of standardized measure held by MBN Properties LP of which 1.7 MMBbls of oil, 7.0 Bcf of natural gas and $50.2 million of standardized measure was owned by the non-controlling interest.\n(b)\nStandardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (using prices and costs in effect as of the period end date) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general administrative expenses and debt service or to depletion, depreciation and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Because we are a limited partnership that allocates our taxable income to our unitholders, no provision for federal or state income taxes have been provided for in the calculation of standardized measure. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n(c)\nOil and natural gas prices as of each date are based on NYMEX prices per Bbl of oil and per MMBtu of natural gas at such date, with these representative prices adjusted by field to arrive at the appropriate net price.\nProved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production."

    "choices": [
      "A) The Langlie Mattix field has a higher standardized measure but lower daily production, indicating better long-term value but slower immediate returns.",
      "B) The Denton field has a higher percentage of liquids and shorter reserve life, suggesting it's better suited for quick production and near-term cash flow.",
      "C) The Langlie Mattix field has more proved undeveloped locations, implying greater future drilling opportunities despite lower current production.",
      "D) The Denton field's higher daily production and similar standardized measure indicate it's the superior investment regardless of reserve life."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C\n) This question requires analysis and integration of multiple data points from the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Langlie Mattix field has 23 more proved undeveloped locations and an additional 41 unproved 20-acre locations, while no such information is provided for the Denton field. This implies greater future drilling opportunities in Langlie Mattix.\n\n2. Despite having lower current production (237 Boe/d vs 474 Boe/d for Denton), Langlie Mattix has a similar standardized measure ($40.2 million vs $39.0 million for Denton). This suggests potential for long-term value.\n\n3. Langlie Mattix has a longer reserve life (17.5 years vs 12.6 years for Denton), indicating sustained production potential.\n\n4. The Langlie Mattix field has a slightly higher percentage of liquids (88% vs 82% for Denton), which are generally more valuable than natural gas.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Langlie Mattix does have lower daily production, its standardized measure is only slightly higher, not significantly so.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Denton actually has a lower percentage of liquids compared to Langlie Mattix.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it oversimplifies the comparison, ignoring important factors like reserve life and future drilling opportunities.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze and compare complex sets of data, considering both immediate production metrics and long-term potential, which aligns with higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."

    "question": "Brigham Exploration Company has been active in the Texas Gulf Coast region for several years. Given their drilling history and recent focus on the Vicksburg Trend, which of the following strategies would most likely maximize Brigham's return on investment in the near future?\n",
    "documentation": [
      "Since 1996 Brigham has completed 59 (21.7 net) wells in 75 (27.3 net) attempts in the Texas Gulf Coast for a net completion rate of 79%. Brigham has discovered cumulative net proved reserves of 60 Bcfe at an average net drilling finding cost of $0.85 per Mcfe. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, Brigham completed 34 (10.8 net) wells in 43 (14.5 net) attempts in the Texas Gulf Coast for a net completion rate of 74%. Brigham retained an average working interest in these wells of 34% and added approximately 36 net Bcfe of proved reserves at an average drilling finding cost of $1.02 per Mcfe.\nFor 2002, Brigham intends to focus the majority of its Texas Gulf Coast drilling activities in the following key focus plays:\nVICKSBURG TREND\nBrigham has made two significant field discoveries (Home Run Field and Triple Crown Field) in the Vicksburg trend since 1999. Brigham and its participant, a major integrated oil company, acquired a 54 square mile program in 1997 and 1998, and jointly control 10,000 gross and net acres of leasehold. Brigham retained a 34% working interest in the project to explore and develop the Vicksburg formation below 10,000 feet, but increased its pre-payout working interest to 50% in select acreage that was subsequently drilled as its Triple Crown Field discovery. Also in the project, in the prospective zones above 10,000 feet, the Company retained a 100% working interest in its original 4,000 acre lease block. Since 1999, excluding the Palmer #5 well (which experienced a casing failure) Brigham has completed eight Vicksburg wells in eight attempts at an estimated proved developed drilling finding cost of $1.47 per Mcfe.\nHOME RUN FIELD\nBrigham discovered the Home Run Field in late 1999 with its Palmer State #2 discovery well. The Brigham operated Palmer State #2 began producing in February 2000 at an initial rate of 10.1 MMcf of natural gas and 650 barrels of condensate per day, or 4.1 MMcfe to Brigham's 29% net revenue interest. At year-end 2001, the Palmer #2 had produced 3.2 Bcfe and was producing 2.0 MMcfe per day.\nIn 2001, Brigham completed four wells in its Home Run Field. Two of these wells, the Palmer #4 and the D.J. Sullivan #C-25, were spud in the fourth quarter of 2000 and completed during the first quarter of 2001. Brigham retained a 34% working interest in both wells. The Palmer #4, an offset to\nthe previously drilled Palmer #2 and Palmer #3 wells, was drilled to a total depth of approximately 13,550 feet and encountered prospective pay intervals in several of the targeted Lower Vicksburg objectives. The Palmer #4 was fracture stimulated in four Vicksburg pay intervals and began producing to sales in March 2001 at 6.8 MMcf of natural gas and 280 barrels of condensate per day, or 2.5 MMcfe net to Brigham's 29% net revenue interest. The D.J. Sullivan #C-25 began producing to sales in March at 9.8 MMcf of natural gas and 390 barrels of condensate per day, or 3.0 MMcfe net to Brigham's 25% net revenue interest. At year-end 2001, the D.J. Sullivan #C-25 had produced 1.5 Bcfe and was producing 3.1 MMcfe per day.\nDuring August 2001, Brigham drilled the Palmer #5, its fourth successive development well in the Home Run Field and encountered pay intervals comparable to the previously completed D.J. Sullivan #C-25 well. Subsequent to fracture stimulation, Brigham's initial completion of one of several potential pay intervals in the Palmer #5 tested at an estimated 1.6 MMcf of natural gas per day. However, surface production facilities subsequently plugged with large pieces of formation and steel casing fragments, and repeated attempts to restore the well to production were unsuccessful. The Company believes that the well's problems were created by a poor cement job caused by a casing failure during cementing operations. As a result, Brigham is currently pursuing compensation for losses, and anticipates drilling a replacement well late in 2002. See \"Item 3.",
      "As of December 31, 1998, the Company had acquired 1,689 square miles (1.1 million acres) in the West Texas region, the vast majority of which has been interpreted. The Company does not currently intend to acquire additional 3-D seismic data in this province for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 1998, Brigham had completed 185 wells in 298 attempts (62% success rate) with an average working interest of 23% in its West Texas province and had found cumulative proved reserves of 20 net Bcfe at an average net drilling cost of $1.39 per Mcfe. In its West Texas drilling program in 1998, the Company completed 6 wells in 11 attempts with an average working interest of 45% adding 0.5 net Bcfe of proved reserves (including revisions to prior years' estimates) at an average net drilling cost of $9.06 per Mcfe. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had an estimated 140 3-D delineated potential drilling locations in the West Texas region. The Company does not currently plan to drill any wells in its West Texas province in 1999.\nNATURAL GAS AND OIL RESERVES\nThe Company's estimated total net proved reserves of natural gas and oil as of December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and the present values attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows:\n- -------------------------\n(1) Prior to the Exchange consummated in February 1997, the Company was a partnership and not subject to income taxes. Had the Company been a taxable corporation at December 31, 1996, the Standardized Measure would have been $32.4 million, reflecting a pro forma estimate for the discounted value of future income taxes.\nThe reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (\"Cawley Gillespie\"), the Company's petroleum consultants, and are part of reports on the Company's oil and natural gas properties prepared by Cawley Gillespie. The base sales prices for the Company's reserves were $3.71 per Mcf for natural gas and $25.37 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1996, $2.27 per Mcf for natural gas and $15.50 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1997, and $2.12 per Mcf for natural gas and $9.50 per Bbl for oil as of December 31, 1998. These base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well-by-well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate the Company's reserves at these dates.\n- 15 -"

      "A) Increase drilling activities in the West Texas region to diversify their portfolio",
      "B) Focus on developing the Home Run Field, particularly by addressing the Palmer #5 well issues",
      "C) Shift resources to explore formations above 10,000 feet in the Vicksburg Trend",
      "D) Prioritize new exploratory drilling in the Texas Gulf Coast outside of established fields"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B\n) This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided information. The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. Recent success: Brigham has had significant success in the Texas Gulf Coast, with a 79% net completion rate since 1996 and a 74% completion rate in the last three years. This suggests continuing focus in this area is prudent.\n\n2. Vicksburg Trend focus: The document states that Brigham intends to focus the majority of its Texas Gulf Coast drilling activities on key focus plays, including the Vicksburg Trend.\n\n3. Home Run Field potential: The Home Run Field, discovered in 1999, has shown promising results. The Palmer #2 well had produced 3.2 Bcfe by year-end 2001 and was still producing 2.0 MMcfe per day. Other wells in this field (Palmer #4 and D.J. Sullivan #C-25) also showed strong initial production rates.\n\n4. Palmer #5 opportunity: The Palmer #5 well encountered pay intervals comparable to the successful D.J. Sullivan #C-25 well but faced technical issues due to a suspected casing failure. Addressing these issues and potentially drilling a replacement well in late 2002 represents a significant near-term opportunity to increase production in a proven field.\n\n5. Economics: The drilling finding costs in the Texas Gulf Coast ($1.02 per Mcfe in the last three years) and specifically in the Vicksburg Trend ($1.47 per Mcfe) are favorable compared to the overall company history ($0.85 per Mcfe since 1996).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the West Texas region shows poorer economics ($9.06 per Mcfe in 1998) and the company does not plan to drill there in the near future. Option C is less attractive because Brigham has a lower working interest (34%) in the deeper Vicksburg formation compared to 50% in some parts of the Home Run Field. Option D is riskier than focusing on developing proven fields like Home Run.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, analyze economic factors, and apply strategic thinking to maximize returns in the oil and gas industry."

    "question": "A mining company is considering expanding its operations in the Pioche District of Lincoln County, Nevada. Given the historical context and geological information provided, which of the following strategies would be most appropriate for a modern exploration company to pursue in this area?\n",

      "Item 2. Properties\nOur Corporate Offices\nTucson, Arizona\nOur corporate offices, which are located at 5210 E. Williams Circle, Suite 700, Tucson, Arizona 85711, are leased from an affiliate, Atlas Precious Metals, Inc., who have a five-year lease with WC Partners, a Los Angeles, California-based company. We pay Atlas Precious Metals Inc. $9,500 per month for our space at this location. Our space is adequate for our purposes.\nExploration Properties and Claims\nWe may explore for various metals, including gold, silver, copper, lead, manganese, zinc, barite; however, our initial primary activities will focus on the exploration of silver. Our exploration rights were obtained through outright property acquisition, staking of federal mining claims on lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, purchase options of privately held surface and mineral rights, purchase of unpatented claims on Bureau of Land Management managed federal lands and through exploration leases. All are held by International Silver without underlying royalty interests. Our properties are located in San Bernardino County, California, the Pioche mining district of Lincoln County, Nevada and Butte, Montana. These properties and the land tenure are further discussed in later sections as:\n\u00b7 The Prince Mine\n\u00b7 Montana Properties\n\u00b7 The Calico Silver Project\nWith respect to our properties for exploration purposes, our properties may or may not progress to the development stage. We are subject to competitive conditions for exploration properties since our competitors may be in a better operational and financial position to compete against us for desirable properties. Additionally, there are material issues regarding whether we do or do not insure our properties.\nThe Pioche Mining District, Lincoln County, Nevada\nIntroduction:\nOur principal area of interest is the Pioche District of Lincoln County, Nevada. We believe that this District represents a unique opportunity in North American mining, in that, we have secured control of a large portion of a very unique silver district and plan to continue to expand our holdings in this area. For the next few years, we will focus our attention to this district, to completing the acquisition of the Prince Mine, which we have under a lease with a purchase option. The district is of a size that may give many years of profitable commercial operations.\nHistory:\nSilver was discovered on the eastern slope of the Pioche Mountains in 1869 and exploited for high grade, bonanza silver ore until the 1930's when the known fissures were fundamentally depleted. This ore occurred in brecciated fissure veins hosted in the Cambrian age Prospect Mountain Quartzite. This type of ore was found near the town of Pioche mostly in the Treasure Hill area. The veins ranged in thickness from one to four feet, with swells up to ten feet, but the three most productive extended for several thousand feet in strike and to a depth of 1200 feet. The silver ore was mostly oxidized and contained lead as cerussite, some galena, with silver chloride and argentite. Supergene processes apparently removed the zinc from the non-reactive siliceous rock which was likely present in the original sulfides.",

This ore occurred in brecciated fissure veins hosted in the Cambrian age Prospect Mountain Quartzite. This type of ore was found near the town of Pioche mostly in the Treasure Hill area. The veins ranged in thickness from one to four feet, with swells up to ten feet, but the three most productive extended for several thousand feet in strike and to a depth of 1200 feet. The silver ore was mostly oxidized and contained lead as cerussite, some galena, with silver chloride and argentite. Supergene processes apparently removed the zinc from the non-reactive siliceous rock, which was likely present in the original sulfides.",

Manquiri\u2019s principal asset is the mining rights in the San Bartolome project, a silver property located near the city of Potos\u00ed, Bolivia, on the flanks of the Cerro Rico mountain. The San Bartolome project consists of several distinct silver-bearing gravel deposits, which are locally referred to as pallaco or sucu deposits. These deposits lend themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. The deposits were formed as a result of erosion of the silicified silver-rich upper part of the Cerro Rico mountain.\nThe mineral rights for the San Bartolome project are held through long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian State Mining Company (\u201cCOMIBOL\u201d). Manquiri controls 67 square kilometers of concessions (16,600 acres). The joint venture lease agreements are subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company purchased an additional property known as the Phalpo property which is adjacent to the original property package for $1.3 million. The properties are currently subject to monthly payments totaling approximately $34,700.\nOf the several pallacos deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo (consisting of Diablo Norte, Diablo Sur and Diablo Este) and Santa Rita. During 2000, the Company under took an intensive field program and completed a pre-feasibility study. The field program included detailed exploration, bulk sampling, definition drilling, metallurgical studies and environmental baseline data collection. To assist with the pre-feasibility study, which was completed during 2000, Coeur retained third party engineering and geological consulting firms to examine and verify all data used in the study, including the estimate of mineralized material, process flow sheet design, site plan layout and detailed estimates of all operating and capital costs. The study incorporated a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit. In addition, the study identified a number of optimization opportunities that if successful, could significantly enhance the economic returns of the project.\nWe completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately 6 million ounces of silver annually. During the third quarter of 2003, we retained Flour Daniel Wright and SRK to prepare an updated feasibility study which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the preliminary results of this more recent feasibility study, we estimate the capital cost of the project to be approximately $80 million, the annual production to be approximately 6 million ounces of silver over an initial mine life of approximately 14 years, and the cash costs per ounce of silver produced to be approximately $2.50. Recent feasibility work in the defining ore bodies has indicated the potential to expand mineral resources. As a consequence, the Company is reviewing an alternative to increase the planned plant throughput. Advanced metallurgical test work indicates changes in the processing circuit may result in increases in silver recovery. We are now assessing the impact of such information on revenue, operating costs and capital associated with such improvements. The measured and indicated resources are currently under study and we expect this to result in a marked increase in the proven and probable reserves.

Access to the property and the Company\u2019s pre processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potos\u00ed.\nThe mineral rights for the San Bartolom\u00e9 mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian State Mining Company (\u201cCOMIBOL\u201d). Manquiri controls 67 square kilometers under lease from COMIBOL and 16,600 acres under lease from the cooperatives at San Bartolom\u00e9 and approximately 17.8 square miles of concessions at the Khori Huasi property, a gold exploration target south of Potos\u00ed. The San Bartolom\u00e9 lease agreements, executed between 1996 and 2003 and with 25 year terms, are generally subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company acquired additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The Company incurred royalty payments for these mining rights totaling $6.6 million. commencing with operating activities in June 2008.\nCoeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (\u201cASARCO\u201d) on September 9, 1999. Manquiri\u2019s principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolom\u00e9 mine. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolom\u00e9.\nWe completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually. In 2003, SRK, an independent consulting firm, was retained to review the reserve/resource estimate to include additional sampling data to incorporate additional resources acquired with the Plahipo project at Cerro Rico. During 2003, we retained Fluor Daniel Wright to prepare an updated feasibility study which was completed at the end of the third quarter of 2004. The study provides for the use of a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit which will result in the production of a dor\u00e9 that may be treated by a number of refiners under a tolling agreement which results in the return of refined silver to the Company that is readily marketed by metal banks and brokers to the ultimate customer. During 2004, the Company obtained all operating permits and commercial construction activities commenced.\nThe property and equipment were placed into service in June 2008 and are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventative maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility. The San Bartolom\u00e9 mine commenced production on June 27, 2008. Silver production for 2008 was 2.9 million ounces. Total cash costs per ounce for 2008 were $10.53 per ounce. Operational results continue to improve and the Company now expects production for 2009 to be approximately 9.0 million ounces of silver."

Higher upward and downward revisions for the net profits interests as compared with the underlying properties in each year were caused by changes in the year-end gas price which resulted in increased gas reserves allocated to or from the trust.\nProved Developed Reserves\nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows from Proved Reserves\nChanges in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows from Proved Reserves\n(a)Significant revisions in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were caused by the changes in year-end gas prices.

    "question": "A retail outdoor equipment company is facing increased competition from larger, more established competitors. Which combination of strategies would be most effective in maintaining their market position while leveraging their unique strengths?\n",
    "documentation": [
      "Many of our competitors have a larger number of stores and some of them have greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, than we have. We believe that we compete effectively with our competitors on the basis of our wide and distinctive merchandise selection and the superior customer service associated with the Cabela\u2019s brand, as well as our commitment to understanding and providing merchandise that is relevant to our targeted customer base. We cater to the outdoor enthusiast and the casual customer, and believe we have an appealing store environment. We also believe that our multi-channel retail model enhances our ability to compete by allowing our customers to choose the most convenient sales channel. This model also allows us to reach a broader audience in existing and new markets and to continue to build on our nationally recognized Cabela\u2019s brand.\nCustomer Service\nSince our founding in 1961, we have been deeply committed to serving our customers by selling high quality products through sales associates that deliver excellent customer service and in-depth product knowledge. We strive to provide superior customer service at the time of sale and after the sale through our 100 percent money-back guarantee. Our customers can always access well-trained, knowledgeable associates to answer their product use and merchandise selection questions. We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our customers and encourage repeat visits and purchases is due, in part, to the strength of our customer support and service operations.\nFinancial Services Business\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, World\u2019s Foremost Bank, we issue and manage the Cabela\u2019s Club VISA card and related customer loyalty rewards program. We believe the Cabela\u2019s Club VISA card loyalty rewards program is an effective vehicle for strengthening our relationships with our customers, enhancing our brand name and increasing our merchandise revenues. The primary purpose of our financial services business is to provide our merchandise customers with a rewards program that will enhance revenues, profitability and customer loyalty in our direct and retail businesses.\nOur bank subsidiary is an FDIC-insured, special purpose, Nebraska state-chartered bank. Our bank\u2019s charter is limited to issuing credit cards and selling brokered certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more and it does not accept demand deposits or make non-credit card loans. During fiscal 2004, we had an average of 618,951 active accounts with an average month-end balance of $1,436. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements and our \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for financial information regarding our financial services business.\nThe Cabela\u2019s Club VISA card loyalty program is a rewards based credit card program, which we believe has increased brand loyalty among our customers. Our rewards program is a simple loyalty program that allows customers to earn points whenever and wherever they use their credit card and then redeem\nearned points for products and services through our direct business or at our destination retail stores. The rewards points are easy to redeem and never expire as long as the account is in good standing. The rewards program encourages our customers to buy more merchandise at a discount when they redeem their accumulated points. Our rewards program is integrated into our store point of sale system which adds to the convenience of the rewards program as our employees can inform customers of their number of accumulated points when making purchases at our stores. In fiscal 2004, approximately 17.7% of our total merchandise sales in our direct and retail businesses were made to customers who used their Cabela\u2019s Club VISA credit card, compared to 17.1% in fiscal 2003.",
      "The Company's units are brightly decorated with its trademark signage to create a consistent appearance and encourage customer recognition and patronage. The Company believes that consistency of brand image is important to the successful operation and expansion of its retail marketing system. In all aspects of its retail marketing operations the Company emphasizes quality, value, cleanliness and friendly and efficient customer service. The Company has conducted customer surveys which indicate strong consumer preference for units which are well-lighted and safe. In response to such customer preferences, the Company has initiated a system-wide lighting upgrade and safety enhancement program which includes the installation of improved lighting as well as the installation of its proprietary Coronet Security System, an interactive audio and video monitoring system, at over 180 of its units.\nWhile the Company derives approximately 79% of its retail revenue from the sale of gasoline, it also provides a variety of merchandise and other services designed to meet the non-fuel needs of its customers. Sales of these additional products are an important source of revenue, contribute to increased profitability and serve to increase customer traffic. The Company believes that its existing retail sites present significant additional profit opportunities based upon their strategic locations in high traffic areas. The Company also offers ancillary services such as compressed air service, car washes, vacuums, and automated teller machines, and management continues to evaluate the addition of new ancillary services such as the marketing of fast food from major branded chains.\nDealer Operations\nThe Company maintains 104 dealer-operated units, 103 of which are located in Maryland. Under the Maryland Divorcement Law, refiners are prohibited from operating gasoline stations. The Maryland units are operated under a Branded Service Station Lease and Dealer Agreement (the \"Dealer Agreement\"), generally with a term of three years. Pursuant to the Dealer Agreement, a dealer leases the facility from the Company and purchases and resells Crown-branded motor fuel and related products. Dealers also purchase and resell merchandise from independent third parties. The Dealer Agreement sets forth certain operating standards; however, the Company does not control the independent dealer's personnel, pricing policies or other aspects of the independent dealer's business. The Company believes that its relationship with its dealers has been very favorable as evidenced by a low rate of dealer turnover.\nThe Company realizes little direct benefit from the sale of merchandise or ancillary services at the dealer operated units, and the revenue from these sales is not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial\nStatements. However, to the extent that the availability of merchandise and ancillary services increases customer traffic and gasoline sales at its units, the Company benefits from higher gasoline sales volumes.\nSupply, Transportation and Wholesale Marketing\nSupply\nThe Company's refineries, terminals and retail outlets are strategically located in close proximity to a variety of supply and distribution channels. As a result, the Company has the flexibility to acquire available domestic and foreign crude oil economically, and also the ability to cost effectively distribute its products to its own system and to other domestic wholesale markets. Purchases of crude oil and feedstocks are determined by quality, price and general market conditions.\nTransportation"

The text emphasizes that determining \"the tenor, and extent of the friable material were the two major objectives of this program.\" This friable material is described as \"very easy/economical to be mined and processed, and typically contains the highest percentages of graphite over consistent widths.\"\n\n4. While option A considers the entire sampled interval, it doesn't focus on the most economically viable section. Option B focuses on a high-grade but limited section, potentially missing out on the broader economic potential. Option D suggests expanding exploration, which might be premature before fully developing the known high-potential area.\n\n5. The mini-bulk sample from the Weather Zone showed positive results with easy liberation of graphite and good flotation test results, further supporting the focus on this area.\n\nBy prioritizing areas proximal to the abandoned creek channel, the company can target the most friable, easily mineable, and potentially high-grade material, optimizing the economic viability of the prospect."

    "question": "Evergreen is considering expanding its coal bed methane operations in the Raton Basin. Given the company's current water management practices and potential challenges, which of the following strategies would be most effective in ensuring long-term environmental compliance and operational efficiency?\n",
    "documentation": [
      "WATER PRODUCTION AND DISPOSAL. Based on the Company's previous experience in coal bed methane production in the Raton Basin and extensive laboratory analysis of water samples taken from its coal bed methane wells, management believes that the groundwater produced from the Raton Basin coal seams will not exceed permit levels and will continue to be low in total dissolved solids and show a general absence of hydrocarbon contaminants such as benzene, in many cases meeting state and federal primary drinking water standards. Recent gas analyses confirm that the gas stream is 99% pure methane and lacks other hydrocarbon sources of contamination. This means that the Company can lawfully dispose of water into well-site pits and evaporation ponds pursuant to permits obtained from the State of Colorado. In some cases the water is of such quality that it can be discharged to arroyos and surface water under a general water discharge permit issued to the Company by the State of Colorado. This permit gives Evergreen the flexibility to add water discharge points on an as-needed basis with minimal administrative paperwork and within 30 days or less of application. Evergreen currently has in excess of 200 approved discharge points. The Company has applied for a second general discharge permit for proposed well sites in the Apishapa River drainage in the northern most portion of Evergreen's acreage and for an increase in the total volume of water permitted for surface discharge. Approval of these requests is uncertain and is dependent upon completion of additional study by the State of Colorado. These and other surface disposal options require an extensive third-party water sampling and laboratory analysis program to ensure compliance with state permit standards. These monitoring costs are directly related to the number of well-site pits, evaporation ponds and\ndischarge points. Because it originates in a natural groundwater system, there is some uncertainty whether water currently being discharged to streams and arroyos will continue to meet permit standards for total iron and suspended solids. Water not meeting these discharge standards can be disposed of in well-site pits and evaporation ponds.\nIf water of lesser quality is discovered or Evergreen's wells produce water in excess of the applicable permit limits, the Company may have to drill additional disposal wells to re-inject the produced water into deeper sandstone horizons. This would also have to be accomplished through an appropriately issued permit that has been routinely approved in the past.\nRATON BASIN PRODUCTION. Evergreen's natural gas sales from the Raton Basin did not commence until the completion of a pipeline system in January 1995, which connected its Raton Basin wells to the CIG pipelines. From January 1995 through December 2000, the Company sold an aggregate of approximately 52 Bcf of coal bed methane gas from the Raton Basin. Evergreen's net daily gas sales are currently approximately 78 MMcf per day. Because of the importance of removing water from the coal seams to enhance gas production, the Company expects to continue production from more modest wells because of the beneficial ambient effect of pressure reduction in adjacent, more productive wells. Each well creates its own \"cone of depression\" around the wellbore. The Company believes that some of its Raton Basin wells on adjacent 160-acre drill sites have already created overlapping cones of depression, enhancing gas production in each well within this pattern. In some cases this pattern of interference can be enhanced by drilling a fifth well in the 640-acre section.",
      "Water Production and Disposal\nBased on the Company's experience in coal bed methane production in the Raton Basin and extensive laboratory analysis of water samples taken from its coal bed methane wells, management believes that the groundwater produced from the Raton Basin coal seams will not exceed permit levels and will be suitable for discharge into arroyos, surface water, well-site pits or evaporation ponds pursuant to permits obtained from the State of Colorado. Recent gas analyses confirm that the gas stream is 99% pure methane and lacks other hydrocarbon sources of contamination. In some cases the water is of such quality that it can be discharged to arroyos and surface water under general water discharge permits issued to the Company by the State of Colorado. These permits give Evergreen the flexibility to add water discharge points on an as-needed basis with minimal administrative paperwork and within 30 days or less of application. Evergreen has in excess of 300 approved discharge points and has received an increase in the total volume of water permitted for surface discharge. Approval of these requests is uncertain and is dependent upon completion of additional study by the State of Colorado. Additionally, the Company contracts with an independent water sampling company that collects the water samples and monitors all the Company's water management program. These monitoring costs are directly related to the number of well-site pits, evaporation ponds and discharge points. Because it originates in a natural groundwater system, there is some uncertainty whether water currently being discharged to streams and arroyos will continue to meet permit standards for total iron and suspended solids. Water not meeting these discharge standards can be disposed of in well-site pits and evaporation ponds. When water of lesser quality is discovered or Evergreen's wells produce water in excess of the applicable permit limits, the Company may have to drill additional disposal wells to re-inject the produced water into deeper sandstone horizons. Such drilling and disposal would require the Company to obtain permits, similar to those obtained in the past.\nRaton Basin Production\nEvergreen's natural gas sales from the Raton Basin did not commence until the completion of a pipeline system in January 1995, which connected its Raton Basin wells to the Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipelines. From January 1995 through December 2003, the Company sold an aggregate of approximately 167 Bcf of coal bed methane gas from the Raton Basin. Because of the importance of removing water from the coal seams to enhance gas production, the Company expects to continue\nproduction from more modest wells because of the beneficial ambient effect of pressure reduction in adjacent, more productive wells. Each well creates its own \"cone of depression\" around the wellbore. Evergreen believes that some of its Raton Basin wells on adjacent 160-acre sites have already created overlapping cones of depression, enhancing gas production in each well within this pattern. In some cases this pattern of interference can be enhanced by drilling a fifth and sixth well in the 640-acre section.\nRaton Basin gas contains insignificant amounts of contaminants, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide or nitrogen, that are sometimes present in conventional natural gas production. Therefore, the properties of Raton Basin gas, such as heat content per unit volume (British Thermal units, or \"Btu\"), are close to the average properties of pipeline gas from conventional gas wells.\nPiceance and Uintah Basin Operations",

In March of 2014, at the EPA\u2019s request, the Fifth Circuit extended the EPA\u2019s time period for review and additionally, during that same period, our Company conducted a joint groundwater survey of the site, the result of which reaffirmed our Company\u2019s previously filed groundwater direction studies. On or about June 17, 2014, the EPA reaffirmed its earlier decision to uphold the granting of our Company\u2019s existing AE, with the exception of a northwestern portion containing less than 10% of the uranium resource which was withdrawn, but not denied, from the AE area until additional information is provided in the normal course of mine development. On or about September 9, 2014, the petitioners filed a status report with the State District Court which included a request to remove the stay agreed to in August 2013 and to set a briefing schedule (the \u201cStatus Report\u201d). In that Status Report, the petitioners also stated that they had decided not to pursue their appeal at the Fifth Circuit. Our Company continues to believe that the pending appeal is without merit and is continuing forward as planned towards uranium extraction at its fully-permitted Goliad Project."

    "choices": [
      "A) The project is fully permitted, but operations are suspended pending the outcome of an ongoing Fifth Circuit appeal.",
      "B) The project has partial permits, with 90% of the uranium resource area approved for extraction and 10% pending further review.",
      "C) The project is fully permitted, with a state-level appeal pending but federal-level challenges resolved in the company's favor.",
      "D) The project's permits have been revoked, and the company is appealing the decision in both state and federal courts."

    "correct_answer": "C\n) This question requires careful analysis of the complex legal proceedings described in the document. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The document states that \"With the receipt of this concurrence, the final authorization required for uranium extraction, the Goliad Project achieved fully-permitted status.\"\n\n2. While there were initially two legal challenges (one at the state level and one at the federal level), the federal challenge has been resolved:\n   - The EPA reaffirmed its decision to uphold the granting of the existing Aquifer Exemption (AE) on June 17, 2014.\n   - The petitioners stated in their Status Report that \"they had decided not to pursue their appeal at the Fifth Circuit.\"\n\n3. However, there is still a pending state-level appeal:\n   - The document mentions \"We continue to believe that the pending appeal is without merit and we are continuing forward as planned towards uranium extraction at its fully-permitted Goliad Project.\"\n\n4. The company is proceeding with its plans despite this pending appeal, indicating confidence in its legal position.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Fifth Circuit appeal has been resolved. Option B is partially true (90% approved, 10% withdrawn for further review) but doesn't accurately represent the overall permit status. Option D is incorrect as the permits have not been revoked.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from a complex legal narrative, understand the current status of multiple proceedings, and differentiate between state and federal level challenges."
