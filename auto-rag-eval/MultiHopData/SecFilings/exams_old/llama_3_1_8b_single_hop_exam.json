No core is available at the present time from the earlier exploration or production work. It was Douglas C. Peter\u2019s (author of the referenced NI 43-101 Technical Report) opinion that the uranium and vanadium data from drilling in 2011 and from historical information on analyses and down hole probing were adequate for the purposes of that technical report and for basic resource estimation using those data. Project Geology\nThe Sage Plain and nearby Slick Rock and Dry Valley/East Canyon districts uranium vanadium deposits are a similar type to those elsewhere in the Uravan Mineral Belt. The location and shape of mineralized deposits are largely controlled by the permeability of the host sandstone. Most mineralization is in trends where Top Rim sandstones are thick, usually 40 feet or greater. The Sage Plain District appears to be a large channel of Top Rim sandstone which trends northeast, as one of the major trunk channels that is fanning into distributaries in the southern portion of the Uravan Mineral Belt. The Calliham/Crain/Skidmore (Calliham Mine) and Sage Mine deposits, as well as nearby Deremo and Wilson/Silverbell mines appear to be controlled by meandering within this main channel.

We also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. As previously mentioned, we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets. Our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions. These interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region in north Texas. These assets include approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued development and growing production in the Woodford Shale, located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a capacity of 200 MMcf per day. Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This 220-mile dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal near Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline.

    "documentation": [
      "The gold impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the processing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process. Capital costs for mine, mill, and tailings pond construction can, depending upon the size of the operation, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation. Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million-dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting permits, to ensure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies. Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects."

BNSF Railway\u2019s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF Railway\u2019s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF Railway is now subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF Railway may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF Railway, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF Railway may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF Railway operations.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Four major mining methods were historically employed in the Mine. The oldest is square set or cut and fill. These methods employ support of the stope where the vein is mined with sets of timbers and/or rock bolts, and then sand-fill is pumped from the surface as the mining activity moves to a higher elevation. The broken ore was scraped into chutes by compressed air powered slushers and dropped into ore pockets on the level below. The second method called shrink stoping is similar to the above, but no ground support is required. Instead, the broken ore is used as both ground support and a mining floor and the full mining cut is completed prior to withdrawing the ore from the stope. Air powered slushers or compressed air operated mucking machines on rubber tires were historically used. A third mining method is known as room and pillar mining. In this operation, no timber is required but pillars of ore are left in place as supports until the stoping moves to a higher elevation, at which time sand fill is pumped in to provide the floor for the next cut. As the ore is broken, rubber tired, compressed air operated mucking machines picked it up putting it into a box on the back of the loader. It was then transported to a chute in the stope where it dropped into the ore pocket on a lower level. The fourth method is sublevel blasthole stoping. Diesel powered equipment cuts horizontal slices every forty feet in the ore zones. Then long holes are drilled in the pillars between horizontal slices. The holes are blasted allowing the ore to fall to the bottom slice and scooped up by diesel powered loaders and transported to ore passes. This method was used above the Kellogg Tunnel, and ore was transported by gravity to the tunnel and hauled out by train to the surface. From the ore pockets on the various levels of the mine below the Kellogg Tunnel, ore trains powered by battery driven locomotives transported the ore to ore pockets located at the shaft. In the shaft, large steel buckets, called skips, were loaded and hoisted to the Kellogg Tunnel level where the ore was dumped into two large concrete bins."

      "GSWL also owns and operates the Hwini-Butre and Benso mines located 80 km and 50 km, respectively, south of Wassa. In 2008, following completion of a 50 km haul road, we started mining at Benso and began hauling its ore to Wassa for processing. In May 2009, following completion of a 30 km road extension, the Hwini-Butre mine began trucking ore to the Wassa processing plant. The Benso and Hwini-Butre mines include multiple open pits at both locations as well as mining equipment, equipment repair shops, warehouses and other ancillary support equipment and buildings. Mining was completed at Benso in February 2012. Mining is expected to continue at Hwini-Butre through mid-2014. Geology at Wassa\nWassa lies within the Eburnean Tectonic Province in the West African Precambrian Shield. The Proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the West African craton and host the major gold mineralization in Ghana are subdivided into meta-sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Birimian and Tarkwaian sequences. Wassa is hosted within the same Birimian volcano-sedimentary greenstone package as Bogoso/Prestea. However, Wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the Ashanti Belt while Bogoso and Prestea occur along the northwestern flank. The volcano-sedimentary sequence hosting the Wassa deposit has been affected by four deformational events spanning across the Eoeburnean (age 2.1-2.2 billion years) and Eburnean orogeny (age 2.1 billion years). The associated gold mineralization which has developed during the earlier Eoeburnean deformational event and subsequently deformed during the Eburnean event has\nresulted in a complex re-folded vein system at the Wassa mine. During the Eoeburnean deformation, a series of tight isoclinal folds and a strong fabric marked by chlorites, ankerite, and gold-bearing elongated pyrite was developed along with numerous quartz-ankerite veins. The gold-bearing veins along with the early isoclinal folds were re-folded along a large-scale synform during the Eburnean event. The early isoclinal folds control the distribution of high grade mineralization at depth which have been intercepted by the deep drilling program and will continue to be the main focus of the 2013 Wassa exploration program."

      "In addition, because snowboarding is a winter sport, sales of the Company's snowboard boots have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters. As the Company increases its international sales through VFEL and experiences changes in its product mix, it expects that its quarterly results will vary from historical trends. Therefore, the results of operations of any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, the Company's operating results fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis as a result of holidays, weather and the timing of large shipments. The Company's gross margins also fluctuate according to product mix, cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company's future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts. Historically, the Company has shipped a large portion of its products late in the quarter. Consequently, the Company may not learn of sales shortfalls until late in any particular fiscal quarter, which could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. TRADE CREDIT RISK The Company's results of operations are affected by the timely payment for products by its customers. Although the Company's bad debt expense has not been material to date, no assurance can be given that it will not increase relative to net sales in the future or that the Company's current reserves for bad debt will be adequate. Any significant increase in the Company's bad debt expense relative to net sales could adversely impact the Company's net income and cash flow, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY\nCertain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on the products offered by the Company, including, among other things, general business conditions, interest rates, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions."

      "The power for this property is diesel-generated on site. GEOLOGY\nThe Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Pre-Cambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Kim/Cass zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides. ORE RESERVES Due to the suspension of operations in 1997, no portion of the Colomac dyke is included as part of mineable reserves. Similarly, none of the Kim/Cass property is included as part of mineable reserves and instead has been reclassified to the mineralized material category. GIANT MINE\nSELECTED OPERATING DATA\nBACKGROUND\nThe Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in continuous production since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all-weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the center of the property. Mining is conducted underground and the ore is processed with an on-site mill. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7.6 million ounces of gold. In 1996 the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure which accesses the Supercrest orebody and large scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 opt gold in situ compared to 0.301 ounces of gold per ton at Giant. The net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $57.2 million as of December 31, 1997. The Nicholas Lake property, which was acquired in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife."

In January 1992, the partnership stopped making payments on the first mortgage secured by the One East Penn Square Office Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An affiliate of the lender owned the remaining 45% limited partner interest. In May 1993, the lender filed a foreclosure action against One Penn Square. On October 6, 1993, the court appointed a receiver for the property. The lender also filed an action against the partnership and the Company to set aside, as a fraudulent conveyance, payments from the partnership to the Company in 1992 and in 1993 of $1.8 million made to repay the Company's mortgage note secured by a second lien on the One East Penn Square Office Building. In April 1994, the Company and the lender reached an agreement which provided that the Company pay $575,000 to the lender and convey the Company's interest in the partnership to the lender. In August 1994, the Company made the required $575,000 payment, conveyed its partnership interest to the lender and the parties executed mutual releases and all litigation between the parties was dismissed. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million as the carrying value of its investment in the partnership was less than the debt secured by the One Penn Square Office Building due to previously recognized equity losses.

    "documentation": [
      "This success led to infill drilling and the development of the Windfall open pit mine in 1975, and soon thereafter, the Rustler and Paroni open pit mines. Gold was extracted in a heap-leach operation from sanded and silicified dolomite and silicified shale. No geologic maps exist from this period other than a few maps compiled from USGS work. Although many drill hole location maps are archived in Century Gold files, the coordinates for many drill hole collars are not available, very few collars are visible in the field, and assay data from infill drilling is poorly documented. Exploration: 2005 to 2010 (Staccato Gold) Staccato Gold advanced exploration of the Eureka property and completed drilling between 2005 and 2007, and in follow-up initiated a comprehensive work program in June 2008 which included geologic modeling of all drilling results. This modeling included structural and stratigraphic controls to mineralization, additional density determinations, and new drilling and metallurgical test data. Results of this work were incorporated into subsequent exploration work completed since 2008. From 2005-2007 core drilling programs at Lookout Mountain completed by Staccato Gold provided data to better define stratigraphy in the higher-grade breccia-hosted gold zones at the Lookout Mountain pit and discovered new areas of mineralization. The core drilling and a drill hole re-logging program demonstrated the stratabound nature of gold mineralization in thick zones of collapse breccia within carbonate rock flanking the Ratto Ridge structural zone. Metallurgical and other technical characteristics of known mineralization were subsequently investigated at Lookout Mountain. In October 2009, Staccato Gold also initiated work at the Windfall Project including detailed mapping and sampling programs and completed a ten-hole drill program totaling 8,030 feet (2,448 m). The drilling program focused on testing the extent of gold mineralization below the Windfall and Rustler open pits, located approximately 3 miles northeast of the main Lookout Mountain project mineralized area."

The restructuring of the cooperative to become an LLC was a taxable event for both the cooperative and its shareholders. The tax consequences to the cooperative depended on the value of its assets and apportionment of the value among specific assets, both of which involved risks described in the following risk factors. The shareholders recognized gain or loss depending on when and how their shares in the cooperative were acquired. The amount depended on the value of the cooperative's assets, net of liabilities, and customary discounts allowed, both of which involved valuation risks described in the following risk factors.

      "Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone 3 and Seabrook I. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone 3 is $21.9 million in 1997 dollars, and Seabrook I is $13.7 million in 1997 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Millstone 3:\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone 3, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Subsidiaries of Northeast are the lead participants in Millstone 3. On March 30, 1996, it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone 3 and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee. (See \"Connecticut Yankee\" below.) In October 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it was establishing a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office is responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an Independent Corrective Action Verification Program (ICAVP), (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities. Also, the NRC directed Northeast to submit a plan for disposition of safety issues raised by employees and retain an independent third-party to oversee implementation of this plan."

The property area is dominated by a series of regional N to NNW trending regional faults, and these orientations are also noted at mine scale as seen in the mineralized quartz veins within the property area. Historically the Santa Isabel property focused mining activities on the alluvial deposits within the many tributaries, and progressed to include saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins. S\u00e3o Domingos\nLocation and access\nThe Sao Domingos property lies in the Tapajos Province of Para State, Brazil. It is situated approximately 250 km SE of Itaituba, the regional centre, and includes an area of nearly 8000 ha. Small aircraft service Itaituba daily and on this occasion flights were sourced via Manaus. Access from Itaituba to site is by small aircraft or unsealed road of average to poor quality. The road is subject to seasonal closures and as the visit was at the end of the \u2018wet\u2019 season site access was granted via light aircraft utilizing the local airstrip. Tenure\nThe project covers an area of 6.100 hectares and was granted in 1995 as exploration license number 859.587/1995 and 850.990/1995 to 851.019/1995 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Mineral, and expires in 2012. These licenses were restructured by adding further applications and reductions of some areas under option. Currently the Company has tenure over Processo Nos 850.782/2005, 850.119/2006, 850.684/2006, 859.1995/1995. For ease of reference please see the map below. Option Agreement\nThe S\u00e3o Domingos option agreement allowed us to perform geological surveys and assessment work necessary to ascertain the existence of possible mineral deposits which may be economically mined and to earn a 100% interest in the S\u00e3o Domingos property mineral rights via structured cash payments."

A group of 2,096 metallic screen fire assays performed in 2011 did not indicate any bias in the matching fire assays. On-site Project personnel photograph the core from each individual borehole prior to preparing the split core. Duplicate RC drill samples are collected with one split sent for analysis. Representative chips are retained for geological logging. On-site personnel at the Project log and track all samples prior to sealing and shipping. All sample shipments are sealed and shipped to ALS Chemex in Fairbanks, Alaska, for preparation and then on to ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, or Vancouver, B.C., for assay. ALS Chemex\u2019s quality system complies with the requirements for the International Standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:1999.

      "The zone is gold bearing. The trench interval from 200 to 210 feet assayed 0.048 opt gold and 0.5 opt silver. The interval from 240 to 250 feet contained 0.076 opt gold and 2.6 ounces silver. The adjacent interval from 250 to 260 feet assayed 0.017 opt gold and a half-ounce silver. The eastern margin of trench JTP-2, located 400 feet north of Trench JTP-3, averaged 0.028 opt gold and 0.67 opt silver from 10 to 60 feet. Within this zone, the interval from 50 to 60 foot assayed 0.087 opt gold and .71 opt silver. New information from Kernow Resources\nDuring the summer of 2010, DGRI was able to track down information on the historic exploration done on the property. Key information, including historic drill cuttings and core, with partial assaying, was graciously given to DGRI by Kernow Resources. DGRI was told that eleven of approximately 20 permitted holes in the Jungo area were actually drilled during the 1990\u2019s. DGRI is reviewing these cores and cuttings. Most of these holes were drilled to the west and east of DGRI\u2019s target area because they were targeted on geophysical anomalies. DGRI is focused on apparently younger silicified volcanic vent materials that appear to be low in sulfides, and unlikely to form a strong geophysical signature. It appears that the previous explorers didn\u2019t recognize the vent structures while they were focused on drilling the sulfide-related geophysical targets and a visibly copper-stained vein system. DGRI believes that at least two stages of mineralization occurred in the area. An earlier high-temperature period of mineralization was copper-rich, with limited gold and zinc accessory mineralization. This stage of mineralization had locally strong sulfides, and is likely associated with the geophysical targets. A later apparently lower temperature period of mineralization contains more gold and silver with lower sulfide content that was all oxidized in Dutch\u2019s trenches. The earlier exploration was conducted during a time of lower, and dropping gold prices, and Kernow reportedly had money constraints for continued exploration."

      "This scenario is currently anticipated by our management to be the most reasonable course of action although there is no assurance that this scenario will be adopted. Scenario 4 - Development of existing offshore leases, using existing onshore facilities with additional capacity or adding new facilities to handle a relatively low rate of expanded development. This scenario is similar to #3 above, but would entail increased costs for any new facilities. Scenario 5 - Development of existing offshore leases, using existing onshore facilities with additional capacity or adding new facilities to handle a relatively higher rate of expanded development. Under this scenario we would incur increased costs but revenues would be received more quickly. The development plans for the various units (which have been submitted to the MMS for review) currently provide for 22 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 300 feet for the Gato Canyon Unit; 63 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 1,100 feet for the Sword Unit; 60 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 336 feet for the Point Sal Unit; and 183 wells from two platforms for the Lion Rock Unit. On the Lion Rock Unit, Platform A would be set in a water depth of approximately 507 feet, and Platform B would be set in a water depth of approximately 484 feet. The reach of the deviated wells from each platform\nrequired to drain each unit falls within the reach limits now considered to be \"state-of-the-art.\" The development plans for the Rocky Point Unit provide for the inclusion of the Rocky Point leases in the Point Arguello Unit upon which the Rocky Point leases would be drilled from existing Point Arguello platforms with extended reach drilling technology. The approximate distances required to drain the Rocky Point leases range from 2,276 feet to 13,999 feet at proposed total vertical depths ranging from 6,620 feet to 7,360 feet. Current Status.

The schedule of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves was prepared by the General Partner in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). When preparing such reserves, the General Partner follows the SEC's definition regarding oil and gas reserves, which was first published in 1978. The General Partner books proved oil and gas reserves which geological and engineering data show with reasonable certainty to be recovered in the future from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Probable reserves are not booked. The General Partner combines many methods of reserve estimation in order to obtain the most accurate forecast, including both volumetric and analogy methods. Many levels of review occur during this process.

      "A total of 36 drill holes totaling 4,621 meters have thus far tested three principal target areas: the Colonia, Patoa and Tucanare prospects. At the main Colonia trend, a mineralized east-west structure has been traced by drilling for about 500 meters. This trend remains open in both directions along horizontal strike and at depth. Of the two holes drilled this year at the new Jamil prospect in the southern part of the Colonia area, one contained 10.4 meters of 8 g/t gold. The one hole drilled in another completely new area, Dorado, in the northern part of the Colonia area intersected 10.1 g/t over 2 meters. At Patoa, previously announced drill holes SB-04, that intersected 12.2 meters grading 12.2 g/t gold, and SB-18, that intersected 34 meters grading 2.7 g/t gold, may represent the same mineralized trend. In addition, SB-20, that contained 25.5 meters of 1.6 g/t gold, was drilled 600 meters west of the main Patoa area and represents significant untested potential of the Patoa zone. Finally, at the Tucanare prospect, all five drill holes have intersected gold mineralization. 8. Sampling and Analysis\nSoils were taken over large areas and analyzed by assay and by panning to aid in exploration. Auger samples up to 10 meters in depth were also taken in selected areas and analyzed similarly. Sawed core samples were transported from the drill to the camp by vehicle then by truck, boat or plane to the nearest population center where they were air transported to central Brazil for sample preparation at ALS Chemex Laboratories in Goianania or SGS Laboratories in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Final analysis for samples sent to ALS Chemex was completed in the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada or in Lima, Peru. <PAGE>\n9. Security of Samples\nThe geologist in charge supervised the collection of samples on site and the shipping from the site to the point of air transport. Sample tracking by Solitario incorporated transport records and sample receipt by the laboratory in Brazil. Shipping outside of Brazil was supervised by the laboratory."

These factors include:\no the level of domestic production; o the availability of imported oil and gas;\no actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;\no the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity;\no the availability of competitive fuels;\no fluctuating and seasonal demand for gas;\no conservation and the extent of governmental regulation of production;\no the effect of weather;\no foreign and domestic government relations;\no the price of domestic and imported oil and gas and\no the overall economic environment. A substantial or extended decline in oil and/or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value of our gas and oil reserves, and on our financial position, results of operations and access to capital. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is substantially dependent upon oil and gas prices. POTENTIAL INABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL RESERVES Our future success as an oil and gas producer, as is generally the case in the industry, depends upon our ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are profitable. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate additional reserves or that we will drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing proved reserves. DRILLING RISKS Our drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. We may incur significant expenditures for the identification and acquisition of properties and for the drilling and completion of wells."

      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Royalty conveyed to the Trust was carved out of Southland\u2019s (now Hilcorp\u2019s) working interests and royalty interests in certain properties situated in the San Juan Basin. See Item 1. Business, for information on the conveyance of the Royalty to the Trust. References below to \u201cgross\u201d wells and acres are to the interests of all persons owning interests therein, while references to \u201cnet\u201d are to the interests of Hilcorp (from which the Royalty was carved) in such wells and acres. Unless otherwise indicated, the following information in this Item 2 is based upon data and information furnished to the Trustee by Burlington and Hilcorp. The Subject Interests\nThe Subject Interests consist of working interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests and other contractual rights in 151,900 gross (119,000 net) producing acres in San Juan, Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties of northwestern New Mexico. According to the information provided by Hilcorp, there were, as of December 31, 2018, 4,322 gross (828.1 net) wells on the properties underlying the Subject Interests, calculated on a well bore basis and not including multiple completions as separate wells, of which approximately 988 gross (274.7 net) wells were Multiple Completion Wells, resulting in a total of 5,382 gross (1,134.7 net) completions. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that all of the subject acreage is held by production, and even though it has not been fully developed in every formation, Hilcorp has classified all of such acreage as developed. Production from conventional natural gas wells is primarily from the Pictured Cliffs, Mesaverde and Dakota formations, ranging in depth from 1,500 to 8,000 feet. Additional production is attributable to coal seam reserves in the Fruitland Coal formation. Coal seam natural gas constituted approximately 15% of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018. The process of removing coal seam natural gas is often referred to as degasification or desorption."

      "Great South Land Minerals Limited has made submissions supporting its case to the Minister on both occasions and has no reason to believe that Special Exploration License 13/98 should be revoked. Should the Minister attempt to revoke the license, which is effectively a contract between the company and the Government, this action would be vigorously defended and damages caused as consequence of commercial destabilisation would be sought. The Terrex Seismic trucks have completed 271 line kilometers of seismic onshore Tasmania from March 2007. In addition, a Competent Persons Report has been written to comply with our intended fund raising efforts, along with a geophysical assessment and compilation of the target structures. Together with our ongoing regional gravity survey, we believe this clearly demonstrates to the Government, our shareholders and the Tasmanian public, our commitment to fulfill all conditions precedent for a commercial discovery into production. Great South Land Minerals Limited and its predecessor companies have spent substantial amounts on exploration activities. These activities have so far established the presence of two petroleum systems, the Larapintine Petroleum System and the Gondwana Petroleum System. In identifying these petroleum systems, Great South Land Minerals Limited has proved the presence of quality source world class source rocks, including the Tasmanite Oil Shale which is the richest oil and gas source rock and is used as the world standard for type 1 kerogen, that are thermally mature for the generation of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. This determination shows that hydrocarbons have been generated, expelled and migrated into potential reservoir units. Although recent seismic data has shown the potential for trapping mechanisms, the Company is undertaking additional gravity and seismic work to identify potential drill targets. Great South Land Minerals Limited continues its exploration activities with exploration drilling & stratigraphic coring activities being planned in strategic locations."

      "CGI generally receives between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and from 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from natural gas liquids sales. Under keep-whole gas purchase contracts, CGI retains all natural gas liquids recovered by its processing facilities and keeps the producers whole by returning to the producers at the tailgate of its plants an amount of residue gas equal on a BTU basis to the natural gas received at the plant inlet. The keep-whole component of the contract permits the Company to benefit when the value of natural gas liquids is greater as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream. OIL AND GAS MARKETING\nThe Company's oil and gas production is sold primarily under market sensitive or spot price contracts. The Company sells substantially all of its casinghead gas to purchasers under varying percentage-of-proceeds contracts. By the terms of these contracts, the Company receives a fixed percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The Company normally receives between 80% and 100% of the proceeds from natural gas sales and from 80% to 100% of the proceeds from natural gas liquids sales received by the Company's purchasers when the products are resold. The natural gas and natural gas liquids sold by these purchasers are sold primarily based on spot market prices. The revenues received by the Company from the sale of natural gas liquids is included in natural gas sales. As a result of the natural gas liquids contained in the Company's production, the Company has historically improved its price realization on its natural gas sales as compared to Henry Hub or other natural gas price indexes. For the year ended December 31, 1998, purchases of the Company's natural gas production by GPM Gas Corporation accounted for 11.5% of the Company's total gas sales for such period and for the same period purchases of the Company's oil production by Koch Oil Company accounted for 79.8% of the Company's total produced oil sales."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Since SSGM's tailings' resource is exhausted, virgin gold ore is excavated from the SSGM surface and hauled to the SCMP site. The other sources of gold ore from the SSGM to be used at the SCMP operation will be obtained from the stope fill or higher grade gold ore after obtaining access through the underground workings from the main ore body. This gold ore will have to be crushed and pulverized which increases the cost, but then the yield is expected to be about a 92% recovery. The income, dependent on the market price of gold from the higher grade and recovery of gold ore, will be substantially more than the cost involved, providing that the world gold market price does not decline below $200 an ounce. The virgin ore and/or tailings are referred to herein as \"gold ore.\" The gold ore from the SSGM open-pit is loaded onto 20-25 ton dump trucks for transport to the SCMP. Trucks then haul the gold ore approximately 15 miles from the SSGM. Mine employees are responsible for the mining activities including the determination of areas to be excavated, trucking and loading operations, head sampling and sample analysis. The gold ore is received at the SCMP where it is weighed, logged, and sampled. Weighing is performed utilizing a conveyor belt scale and/or a truck scale located on the SCMP site. The excess gold ore is then unloaded at the SCMP site and stockpiled in an area which was developed to allow storage of more than 15,000 tons. SSGM gold ore is transferred from the stockpile to a feed bin utilizing a rubber-tired wheel loader. The feed bin has a capacity of approximately 10 cubic yards (13.5 tons). The feed is fed at a controlled rate onto a conveyor, which transfers the ore to the next part of the process. The conveyor includes a belt scale (weightometer) for instantaneous determination of feed rate and totalizing of tonnage fed to the process. The Joint Venture completed a certain stage of the retrofitting, rehabilitation, repairing and restoring of the SCMP's plant and it continues to perform such plant and equipment alterations, modifications and improvements to expand the SCMP's capacity to process 300/400 tons of virgin ore per day."

We gather casinghead gas and natural gas from more than 300 wells that are connected to the system. The gas is gathered through low-pressure pipelines and is redelivered to the plant for processing. Natural gas liquids are extracted from the gas stream at the plant. The liquids are transported via pipeline to Koch's Medford facility for fractionation. Residue gas is sold at the tailgate of the plant to either intrastate or interstate pipelines. Natural gas and casinghead gas are purchased at the wellhead primarily under market sensitive percent-of-proceeds-index contracts or fee-based contracts. Under percent-of-proceeds-index contracts, we receive a fixed percentage of the monthly index posted price for natural gas and a fixed percentage of the resale price for natural gas liquids. We generally receive between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from the natural gas liquids. Under the fee-based contracts, we receive a fixed rate per MMBTU for gas sold. This rate per MMBTU remains fixed regardless of commodity prices. Matli Gas Plant and Gas Gathering System. In 2003 we completed construction and commenced operation of our Matli Gas Processing Plant. The plant is utilized to process gas purchased at the wellhead by us from various producers and is located in Central Oklahoma near the town of Watonga. The system, which was constructed in 1998, gathers natural gas from more than 35 wells that are connected to the system. The gas is gathered through low-pressure pipelines and is redelivered to the plant for processing."

      "Cutoff grades are determined for each type of ore based on mining costs and a gold price of $495 (US$350) per ounce. Allowances are made in these estimates for dilution and mining losses. Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling. DUPORT\nBACKGROUND\nThe Duport property is located on Shoal Lake, 28 miles southwest of the town of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, in the Lake of the Woods District. The development ramp is located on an island and is accessible by barge. OWNERSHIP\nIntermittent exploration of the Duport deposit was carried out by various parties from 1930 to 1950, including underground exploration. In 1973, Consolidated Professor Mines Limited obtained an option on the Duport property and conducted an extensive sampling and drilling program from 1973 to 1974. Subsequently, this option was exercised and Consolidated Professor acquired a 100% interest in this property after amalgamating with Duport Mining Company Limited. The Company completed the acquisition of all of the shares of Consolidated Professor in May 1996 pursuant to a tender offer followed by a compulsory acquisition. There is a royalty payable to Union Carbide Canada Limited (\"Union Carbide\") equivalent to a 50% net profits interest until recovery of pre-production expenditures, up to a maximum of $2.0 million. Thereafter, Union Carbide will receive a 10% net profits interest until a maximum of $5.0 million in the aggregate has been paid. The Company also has a right, subject to certain terms and conditions, to buy back the royalty upon payment of a certain sum. MINING AND MILLING FACILITIES The Duport project is situated in the environmentally sensitive area of Shoal Lake, the source of Winnipeg, Manitoba's residential and commercial water supply. Environmental concerns were raised in 1989 by local cottagers and the City of Winnipeg, after Consolidated Professor announced its plans to advance the project to the permitting stage. The main concern was the perception of potential environmental hazards associated with the processing of the refractory gold ore and the disposal of cyanide treated tailings."

In aggregate, three wells have been drilled on this unit, of which two wells were completed and tested in the Monterey formation with calculated flow rates of from 4,000 to 5,000 Bbls per day with an estimated average gravity of 10.6E API. The two\ncompleted test wells were drilled by Conoco, one in 1982 and the second in 1985. The Sword field is located in the western Santa Barbara Channel ten miles west of Point Conception and five miles south of Point Arguello's field Platform Hermosa. Water depths range from 1000 feet to 1800 feet in the area of the field. It is anticipated that the oil and gas produced from the Sword Field will likely be processed at the existing Gaviota consolidated facility and the oil would then be transported out of Santa Barbara County in the All American Pipeline. Access to the Gaviota plant is through Platform Hermosa and the existing Point Arguello Pipeline system. A pipeline proposed to be laid from a platform located in the northern area of the Sword field to Platform Hermosa would be approximately five miles in length.

      "The preceding reserve data in the letter regarding the study represent estimates only and should not be construed to be exact. The estimated present worth of future net revenue amounts shown by the study should not be construed as the current fair market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves since a market value determination would include many additional factors. Reserve estimates may be adjusted from time to time as more accurate information on the volume or recoverability of existing reserves becomes available. Actual reserve quantities do not change, however, except through production. The Trust continues to own only the Royalty Properties that were initially transferred to the Trust at the time of its creation and is prohibited by the Trust Agreement from acquiring additional oil and gas interests. The future net revenue shown by the study has not been reduced for administrative costs and expenses of the Trust in future years. The costs and expenses of the Trust may increase in future years, depending on the amount of income from the Royalty Properties, increases in the Trustee\u2019s fees (including escrow agent fees) and expenses, accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees, and other factors. It is expected that the costs and expenses of the Trust in 2018 will be approximately $2,800,000.

PVNGS Decommissioning Funding\nThe Company has a program for funding its share of decommissioning costs for PVNGS. The nuclear decommissioning funding program is invested in equities and fixed income investments in qualified and non-qualified trusts. The results of the 1998 triannual decommissioning cost study indicated that the Company's share of the PVNGS decommissioning costs excluding spent fuel disposal will be approximately $181 million (in 1998 dollars). The Company funded an additional $6.1 million, $3.9 million and $3.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, into the qualified and non-qualified trust funds. The estimated market value of the trusts at the end of 2001 was approximately $57 million. The NRC amended its rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The amended rules became effective on November 23, 1998. The NRC has indicated that the amendments respond to the potential rate deregulation in the power generating industry and NRC concerns regarding whether decommissioning funding assurance requirements will need to be modified."

    "documentation": [
      "Volcanic and sedimentary strata are capped by a thick sequence of non-deformed Late Tertiary ignimbrites, known as the Upper Volcanic Series (\u201cUVS\u201d). Property Geology\nThe oldest rocks exposed at San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia are deformed Paleozoic shale, sandstone, conglomerate and minor limestone, which are non-conformably overlain by andesite and rhyodacite flows and tuffs of the LVS. Volcanic and sedimentary strata are cut by quartz-feldspar porphyry, porphyritic diorite bodies and fine-grained mafic dykes, which may be co-temporal with the LVS. Ignimbrites of the UVS are exposed at higher elevations on the property and are thought to act as a post mineralization cap rock, thereby indicating an Early to Mid-Tertiary (Paleocene to Eocene) age for gold mineralization at San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia. Geologic Structure\nDetailed mapping within the project area has defined several stages of deformation, beginning with compression during the Laramide Orogeny which affected the Paleozoic basement and formed flat-lying reverse faults, which have been reactivated as conduits for gold-bearing fluids in the La Prieta trend. Extension in Tertiary time led to the development of second order structures, trending south, southwest and southeast; which formed the major structural orientations for mineralization at San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia. The latest phase of deformation is characterized by late-stage extension and southwest tilting. Property Mineralization\nHigh grade gold mineralization at San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia is found in vein structures hosted within andesite and rhyodacite of the Lower Volcanic Series (\u201cLVS\u201d) and underlying Paleozoic sediments as fault breccia veins and crackle breccias that exhibit multiple stages of reactivation and fluid flow, as evidenced by crustiform/colloform textures and cross cutting veins. Locally, veins exhibit sharp, clay gouge hanging wall and footwall contacts with slickensides, indicating reactivation of structurally-hosted veins subsequent to mineralization. Gold grades can also be carried within the mineralized halo adjacent to the principal veins as quartz-chlorite stockwork."

Talco/ Trix-Liz Field and Sulphur Bluff Field. The Talco and Trix-Liz Fields are located in Titus County, Texas, near the town of Talco, about 135 miles northeast of Dallas on 2,252 lease acres. The wells in this field produce from the Woodbine Sands at depths ranging from 3,200 to 3,900 feet and from the Paluxy Sands at a depth of about 4,300 feet. Both the Woodbine Sands and Paluxy Sands are characterized by active water drives and reservoirs. The wells in this field are older wells that were shut down and most of the well equipment removed when the price of oil declined to less than $8.00 per barrel in the mid 1990s. At present 24 of the wells in this field are back in production. Energytec believes approximately 35 of the remaining wells can be reworked successfully and the remaining 60 wells will continue to be evaluated. We drilled 19 development wells during the year ended December 31, 2005. However, these wells were later compromised by regulatory action in that they were illegally dually completed. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Talco/ Trix-Liz field averages approximately 50% across the field. The Sulphur Bluff Field is located in Hopkins County, Texas, three miles south of the town of Sulphur Bluff and approximately half way between Dallas and Texarkana. This field is managed from the district offices in Talco, Texas. Energytec owns the majority (878 lease acres or approximately 80 percent) of this Field, which was discovered in 1925. The 26 wells in this field produce from the Paluxy formation, which is an active water driven reservoir. Three wells are currently producing."

      "BGE filed the manual in February, 1996. ELECTRIC RATE MATTERS ENERGY CONSERVATION SURCHARGE The PSC approved a base rate surcharge effective July 1, 1992 which provides for the recovery of deferred energy conservation expenditures, a return thereon, lost revenues, and incentives for achievement of predetermined goals for certain conservation programs subject to an earnings test. The compensation for foregone sales due to conservation programs and the incentives for achieving conservation goals must be refunded to customers if BGE is earning in excess of its authorized rate of return, as determined by the PSC. (See discussion in ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.) The surcharge is reset on July 1 of each year. ELECTRIC FUEL RATE PROCEEDINGS By statute, electric fuel costs are recoverable if the PSC finds that BGE demonstrates that, among other things, it has maintained the productive capacity of its generating plants at a reasonable level. The PSC and Maryland's highest appellate court have interpreted this as permitting a subjective evaluation of each unplanned outage at BGE's generating plants to determine whether or not BGE had implemented all reasonable and cost effective maintenance and operating control procedures appropriate for preventing the outage. The PSC has established a Generating Unit Performance Program (GUPP) to measure annual utility compliance with maintaining the productive capacity of generating plants at reasonable levels by establishing a system-wide generating performance target and individual performance targets for each base load generating unit. As a result, actual generating performance, after adjustment for planned outages, is compared to the system-wide target and, if met, should signify compliance with the requirements of Maryland law. Failure to meet the system-wide target will result in review of each unit's adjusted actual generating performance versus its performance target in determining compliance with the law, and the basis for possibly imposing a penalty on BGE."

As a result, we have little control over the operations of those wells and this lack of control can act to increase our risk. Operators of these wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests. Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, production from oil and natural gas properties declines as oil and natural gas reserves deplete, with the rate of decline depending on the reservoir characteristics of each producing\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwell. Unless we successfully replace the oil and natural gas reserves that we produce, our oil and natural gas reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in our oil and natural gas production, revenues and cash flow from operations. Historically, we have succeeded in increasing oil and natural gas reserves after taking production into account. However, we may not be able to continue to replace our oil and natural gas reserves in a manner consistent with our past history. Low prices of oil and natural gas also limit the kinds of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically develop. Lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures. Our natural gas gathering and processing operations involve numerous risks that may result in the failure to recover our cost in the natural gas gathering and processing facilities. The cost of developing the gathering systems and processing plants is substantial and uncertain.

      "D) The requirement to take advantage of available ore processing capacity, especially during the initial five years of the Project."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Although ore production does not reach maximum capacity in some years, mining of higher grade ore in these periods with an increase in contained gold and silver ounces does somewhat offset the effect of the lower ore production. The average gold produced over years 2 to 11 is approximately 74,000 oz per year with a maximum of 99,000 oz in Year 8 of production. The average silver produced is approximately 781,000 oz per year over this same period, with a maximum of 1.27 million oz of silver in Year 4 of production. Waste rock mining ranges from a low of approximately 8 million tons (7.3 million tonnes) in Year 1 to a high of approximately 20 million tons (18.2 million tonnes) in Years 5 and 6. The variation in waste rock mining rates is driven by a combination of factors. The current mine production schedule seeks to take advantage of the available ore processing capacity limit of approximately 5.1 million tons (4.7 million tonnes) per year especially during the initial five years of the Project. This results in periods of very high waste production as zones with high mining ratios, i.e. waste tons:ore tons, must be mined in order to expose sufficient ore. In addition, the requirement to ensure the most efficient disposal of waste rock in mined-out phases of the open pits combined with the steep topography leads to truck haulage distances that can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The initial mine life is projected to be 12 years. Note that aggregate sales over a period of thirty years are important for the Project as this will ensure that GQM LLC can meet its closure and closing reclamation requirements. Ore-from-waste separation will require special attention to ensure that overall grade projections are met. Underground mine openings will be encountered from time-to-time during open pit mining and this will be allowed for in the detailed mine planning. Norwest reviewed and confirmed operating cost estimates for the open pit operation for the 2015 updated feasibility study."

      "At December 31, 2018 and 2017, an amount of $35,794 has been accrued for the distribution which is included in accrued liabilities. No amount has been accrued for the 2018 distribution due to uncertainties relating to realization of distributions from NyacAU (see Arbitration). At the conclusion of 2017, we were allocated a distribution of $218,770, under #2 above. In accordance with terms of the Operating Agreement, we had the distribution applied toward Loan3. In 2012, the joint venture purchased, on our behalf, a 2% royalty interest, payable on all production from certain of our mining claims at the Chandalar, Alaska property for $250,000 from Jumbo Basin Corporation. This transaction gave rise to Loan3, is carried at an interest rate of the greater of prime plus 2% or 10%, and is to be repaid from distributions to us as defined in the Operating Agreement, prior to any distributions in cash to us. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance due on Loan3 is $95,239. Arbitration\nIn December 2017, we filed an arbitration statement of claim against NyacAU and other parties. The claim challenged certain accounting treatment of capital leases, allocations of tax losses, charges to the JV for funding costs related to the JV manager\u2019s financing, related-party transactions, and other items of dispute in a previous mediation that was unsuccessful in reaching an agreement. As a result, we participated in an arbitration before a panel of three independent arbitrators during 2018 to address these items. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (\u201cASC 450\u201d), we account for loss or gain contingencies when it is probable that a liability or an asset is realizable and can be reasonably estimated. To date, the arbitration proceedings are in progress and no assurance can be given that the arbitration will result in a successful outcome for us. A successful arbitration may result in increases to the 2017 and 2016 distributions and revise the computation of these distributions in 2018. Due to uncertainties relating to the pending outcome, the financial statements contain no adjustments for the final results of the arbitration."

Environmental Matters\nVarious federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on the Companies with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position. These environmental regulations affect FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that it competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and therefore do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such regulations. Overall, FirstEnergy believes it is in compliance with existing regulations but is unable to predict future change in regulatory policies and what, if any, the effects of such change would be. FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $430 million for 2005 through 2007, which is included in the $3.3 billion of forecasted capital expenditures for 2005 through 2007. Clean Air Act Compliance\nThe Companies are required to meet federally approved SO2 regulations.

Data Verification\nFour different major categories or levels of data verification have been completed at Johnson Camp Mine by Cyprus Copper, Arimetco, Summo, and others in evaluating the geological, drill hole, and assay database. Each major category or level of data verification provides a measure of confidence in the database. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that taken in aggregate, all four categories provide corroboration and thus a higher degree of confidence in the data. The categories include: individual inter-company verifications; intra-company verifications; third party reviews; and reconciliations. Inter-Company Verifications\nCyprus conducted drilling and assaying with both internal and external check assay procedures for data verification. Cyprus had samples assayed at more than one external lab for both total copper and acid-soluble copper. Those external labs were reputable commercial analytical labs commonly employed by the mining and exploration industry at the time. A quality assurance quality control, or QA/QC, procedure was also in place whereby Cyprus composited sample pulps and re-submitted the composite for assay as a comparison with the average of individual assays. In addition, Cyprus did bottle roll tests on core samples to provide an additional analysis for comparison. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that, while these procedures were not done for every hole and every sample, they were done in sufficient amount to detect either errors in the analytical process or high variability in assays as a result of the geology and no significant or consistent variances were noted. The majority of the drill holes in the resource database are core holes drilled by Cyprus. Arimetco drilled with core and by reverse circulation methods. Although Arimetco did not have the same quantity of internal or external check assays as Cyprus, Arimetco made extensive use of an independent, reputable commercial lab."

PVR classifies low sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.0%, medium sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content between 1.0% and 1.5% and high sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 1.5%. Compliance coal is that portion of low sulfur coal that meets compliance standards for the CAA. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 26% of PVR\u2019s reserves met compliance standards for the CAA and 39% were low sulfur. The following table sets forth PVR\u2019s estimate of the sulfur content and the typical clean coal quality of its recoverable coal reserves at December 31, 2007:\n(1) Compliance coal is low sulfur coal which, when burned, emits less than 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTU."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Decreased reserves in the Permian Clearfork area were primarily the result of a negative price revision. The Permian Abo area consists of 1,667 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Terry and Cochran Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Abo area comes from wells in the Kingdom Abo field, which primarily produce from the Abo formation. In 2011, a waterflood pilot program was implemented in the North West Terry Abo unit (\u201cNWTA\u201d) located in the Kingdom Abo field that converted one producing well to an injection well. Boaz Energy fully converted the field to water injection upon purchasing the NWTA in June 2016, and in January 2017 installed a new injection pump that added an additional injection capacity of 2,500 barrels of water per day. In August 2017, NWTA 313 demonstrated initial waterflood response. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Abo to have 0.6 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 84% of which are proved developed reserves. The Permian Shelf area consists of 14,727 net acres on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Glasscock, Schleicher, Stonewall and Coke Counties, Texas. A significant portion of the production in the Permian Shelf area comes from wells in the Fort McKavitt and Flowers fields, which primarily produce from the Canyon formation. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Shelf to have 0.9 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 45% of which are proved developed reserves. The Permian Platform area consists of 4,169 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Ward, Crane, Terry and Ector Counties, Texas. The properties primarily produce from the Clearfork, San Andres, and Devonian formations. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Platform to have 0.4 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 94% of which are proved developed.

      "Mine Exploration\nIn-fill core drilling was conducted at the Buenavista zinc-copper-silver deposit, including directional drilling for geotechnical purposes. A deep drilling campaign was initiated in 2011 to explore the extent of the deposit at depth, drilling a total of 3,860 meters in 2012. For short-term mine planning, 6,652 meters were drilled to confirm copper grade and metallurgical recoveries. Also, in 2011, a condemnation drilling program was initiated to define areas for future infrastructure, as well as areas where leach and waste dumps will be deposited. A total of 28,369 meters of core drilling were completed in 2011. A geohydrology program was initiated in 2011 to explore the possibility of groundwater sources within the mine limits, and a total of 29,750 meters of diamond drilling were drilled in 2012. In addition, 3,797 meters were drilled for water monitoring wells. We did not have a drilling campaign in 2013. In 2014, we performed a drilling program of 20,000 meters in order to verify the reserves. For 2015, we plan to drill 15,000 meters to define reserves and to confirm copper and molybdenum grades. Concentrator\nBuenavista uses state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems at the concentrator, the crushing plant and the flotation circuit in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. Material with a copper grade over 0.38% is loaded onto trucks and sent to the milling circuit, where giant rotating crushers reduce the size of the ore to approximately one-half of an inch. The ore is then sent to the ball and bar mills, which grind it to the consistency of fine powder. The finely ground powder is agitated in a water and reagents solution and is then transported to flotation cells. Air is pumped into the cells producing a froth, which carries the copper mineral to the surface but not the waste rock, or tailings. Recovered copper, with the consistency of froth, is filtered and dried to produce copper concentrates with an average copper content of approximately 27%."

(1)During 1993 the Corporation redefined its industry categories from Standard Industrial Classification codes to internally developed definitions which are based on the primary market in which the borrower operates. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSS Provisions are made to the allowance for possible loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level considered by management to be sufficient to provide for risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses involves a disciplined quarterly analysis. The analysis ensures that all relevant factors affecting loan collectability are consistently applied. The analysis of the allowance relies mainly on historical loss ratios, current general economic and industry trends, and the current and projected financial condition of certain individual borrowers. Specific allocations of the allowance are assigned to individual loans where serious doubt of full principal repayment exists. General allocations of the allowance are assigned to the remaining portfolio primarily on the basis of historical loss factors. The historical loss factors are determined on the basis of past charge-off experience identified by portfolio type and, within each portfolio type, identified by risk rating. A migration analysis is utilized to support the calculation of the allowance and evaluate the overall reasonableness. Management believes the allowance for possible loan loss at December 31, 1993, is adequate based on the risks identified in the various loan categories."

The average rental rates for each of these same years were $716, $704, $688, $679, and $678, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 156 of the 164 Units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 95%. FINANCING\nIn December, 1992 the Partnership borrowed $2,500,000. The loan, secured by a first trust deed against Chandler Villas and guaranteed by the General Partners, bears interest at 5.25% in excess of the seven year treasury yield and all unpaid principal and interest is due on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 1995, the unpaid principal balance was approximately $2,443,000. COMPETITION\nBased on market surveys that conclude that 60% or more of the residents residing in a given facility come from within a 10-mile radius, the primary market for Chandler Villas may be defined by the following cities: Apache Junction, Bapchule, Chandler, Guadalupe, Laveen, Maricopa, Mesa, Ocotillo, Scottsdale, Sun Lakes, and Tempe. The total population of this primary market is 712,812 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications, California, 1996). Assuming that at least 8% of the total population is 65 years of age or older, approximately 57,024 seniors are residing within a 10-mile radius of Chandler Villas. The U. S. Census Bureau, in 1990, reported that 13% of the 65+ population constitutes the primary residential care market, equaling 7,413 seniors in Market Area 2. Currently, there are four facilities in Market Area 2 offering services and features similar to Chandler Villas. These facilities have a combined total of 615 units, potentially housing approximately 676 seniors, or about 9% saturation of the target market. The market may be expanded to 33% or less due to units rented by residents coming from the primary area. Market saturation is also increased by indirect competition from small board and care homes, minimum service senior apartments and residential facilities lacking assisted living services; such facilities are not included in the figures."

Since these shared officers function as both the Company's representatives and those of Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, conflicts of interest could arise between Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its shareholders, on the other. Government Regulation\nThe Company's business is subject to certain federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the drilling for and production, transportation and marketing of oil and gas, as well as environmental and safety matters. Such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in recent years, often imposing greater liability on an increasing number of parties and in some circumstances creating retroactive liability. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is unable to predict the effect or cost of compliance with such requirements or their effects on oil and gas use or prices. In addition, legislative proposals are frequently introduced in Congress and state legislatures which, if enacted, might significantly affect the oil and gas industry. In view of the many uncertainties which exist with respect to any legislative proposals, the effect on the Company of any legislation which might be enacted cannot be predicted. Hedging Activities\nThe Company utilizes energy swap arrangements and financial futures to reduce sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility. If the Company's reserves are not produced at the rates estimated by the Company due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process, operational difficulties or regulatory limitations, the Company will be required to satisfy obligations it may have under fixed price sales or hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production."

This addition increased their rentable floor area from 57,831 square feet to 81,823 square feet. On\nMay 19, 2000 Alstom Power, Inc. executed the third amendment to the lease agreement for the remaining 2,581 square feet of rentable floor area on the second floor of the building. Accordingly, Alstom Power now occupies 100% of the building, and will pay base rent at the same terms and conditions of their original lease. The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Alstom Power Building was $14.05 for 2000, $11.82 for 1999, $9.97 for 1998 and $8.16 for 1997, the first year of occupancy. The occupancy rate at year-end was 100% for 2000, 98% for 1999 and 95% for 1998. Ohmeda Building\nOn February 13, 1998, the Fund IX-X Joint Venture acquired a two-story office building that was completed in 1988 with approximately 106,750 rentable square feet (the \"Ohmeda Building\") on a 15-acre tract of land located in Louisville, Boulder County, Colorado."

      "One Hickory owned the 120,615 sq. ft. One Hickory Centre Office Building in Farmers Branch, Texas. Confederate Point owned the 206 unit Confederate Apartments in Jacksonville, Florida. Foxwood owns the 220 unit Foxwood Apartments in Memphis, Tennessee. Woodsong owned the 190 unit Woodsong Apartments in Smyrna, Georgia. ARI guaranteed a minimum 12.0% return annually based on the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return, ARI was required to pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return for a calendar year and ARI failed to pay the shortfall, TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities for the original purchase price. Because ARI guaranteed the 12.0% return and TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, management classified the consideration paid as a note receivable from ARI. In July 2002, the Woodsong\nIndex to Financial Statements\nApartments were sold. ARI received $2.8 million from the proceeds as payment of principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the note receivable. In October 2003, TCI sold One Hickory to IORI for $12.2 million, less prorations, for a wraparound promissory note of $12.0 million. This note bears interest at 5.49% interest, requires monthly interest and principal payments and matures in June 2006. This transaction effectively discharged the note receivable TCI had from ARI for the financing of One Hickory. Also, in November 2003, Confederate Point sold the Confederate Apartments and paid $2.1 million to TCI to pay off the loan and accrued but unpaid interest. In April 2005, the guaranty period ended and TCI completed the purchase of the Foxwood Apartments by recording the asset and removing the note receivable from ARI. In December 2003, TCI purchased a note receivable secured by a second lien on 33 acres of raw land in Travis County, Texas at par value from ARI for $2.4 million as a paydown on an affiliate loan balance."

    "documentation": [
      "Several siliceous terraces are interbedded with the silicified sediments of the Grassy Mountain Formation. Terrace construction was apparently episodic and intermittently inundated by fluvial/lacustrine sediments and ash, resulting in an interbedded sequence of siltstone, tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, and sinter terrace deposits. Proximal deposits are angular, inhomogeneous, clast-supported breccias of sandstone, siltstone, and sinter with indistinct clast boundaries in a sulfidic mud-textured matrix. Grassy Mountain is a prominent, 150 feet high, silicified and iron-stained knob. Bedding is approximately horizontal at the hilltop, and dips at 10\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 to the north-northeast on the northern and eastern flanks of the hill. The bedding dip steepens to 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 on the west side of the hill due to drag folding in the footwall of the N20W striking Antelope Fault. The southwest slope of Grassy Mountain is covered by silicified arkose landslide debris. Grassy Mountain is a horst block which has been raised 50 to 200 feet in a region of complex block faulting and rotation. Faulting at Grassy Mountain is dominated by post-mineral N30W to N10E striking normal faults developed during Basin and Range extension. On the northeast side of the deposit, these faults progressively down-drop mineralization beneath post-mineral cover. These offsets are suggested by interpreted offsets of a prominent white sinter bed in drill holes as well as intersections with fault gouge. The N70E striking Grassy Mountain Fault shows minor vertical offset of only 10 to 40 feet. The surface expression of the Grassy Mountain system is indicated by weak to moderately strong silicification and iron staining with scattered chalcedonic veins/veinlets. Approximate dimensions of the Grassy Mountain deposit are 1600 feet long by 1000 feet wide by 600 feet thick. The deposit has a general N70 E elongation and a 15\u00b0 bedding plane dip to the north-northeast as a result of faulting and fault block rotation. There is an envelope of lower grade mineralization at depths of 200 to 800 feet which contains a higher-grade zone of mineralization between 500 and 750 feet below the surface."

Auchan is one of the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe. These centers comprise over 10.1 million square feet of GLA and were 97.2% leased as of December 31, 2010. On July 15, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, sold our collective interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owned seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners received net consideration of \u20ac422.5 million for their interests after the repayment of all joint venture debt, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe was approximately $281 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the \u20ac167.4 million (approximately $215 million) principal balance on the Euro-denominated tranche of our Credit Facility. We and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to customary approval rights.

After initiation of production we will pay $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect. This well field was originally developed to supply water for a proposed real estate project in the late 1970\u2019s. One of the existing wells is reported to have pump tested 950 gallons per minute and another 450 gallons per minute. This water is high enough in total dissolved solids to not meet drinking water standards, thus there is no competition for its use. The quality of the water is expected to be adequate for process water needs and the water will require treatment to be potable. Current and Planned Metallurgical Activities\nMetallurgical research done leading to the publication of our Revised PEA of December 2013 has shown the possibility of heap leaching at the Round Top Project. This first step of \u201cdissolving\u201d the REE bearing mineral is the critical factor in the determination to develop REE projects. The type of solvent, its strength and other conditioning necessary to render the elements soluble is, in our opinion, what most affects the ultimate feasibility of a project. TMRC has been able to extract a high percentage of the REE and other elements from the mineralized rock at the Round Top Project, and test work to date also indicates it can be done easily and at projected low operating costs. We are now at the stage of solution concentration and purifying.

Property taxes in the first full year of operations which are the obligation of the tenant, are estimated at approximately $19,000 (approximately 1% of the sales price). Total consideration paid by the Company for the Corona Property was $1,896,949. This cost includes the $1,800,000 sales price payable to the Seller, approximately $20,000 in legal, appraisal, and closing costs, and an $94,000 acquisition fee payable to the Advisor. In addition, $92,000 was received from the Seller in the transfer of prepaid rents. The sale was paid for from the proceeds resulting from the sale of the Company's shares in the current offering. The purchase price was determined through an arms-length negotiation with the Seller. The total cost of $51.11 per square foot is comparable to recent sales in the area for similar properties. Four sales were surveyed and the price per square foot ranged from $48.00 to $57.37, with the weighted square foot average being $51.42. Considering the state of the recovering economy in the area and the long term lease in place with a relatively stable and desirable tenant, the price paid for the Property is considered reasonable. The computation of depreciation for the Corona Property is based on the cost of the property, including Acquisition Fees and Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the Property to various asset categories is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation will be computed on a straight-line basis over 39 years, the estimated component useful life of the assets.

      "The Ahafo mine operates on three mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Ahafo to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 13 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana. The Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu is progressing towards future laybacks. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and thirty-eight 141-tonne haul trucks. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of five underground loaders and eight haul trucks, each with a 60-tonne payload. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The processing plant was commissioned in 2006 to process 7.5 million tonnes of primary and oxide ore per year. With the depletion of oxide ore, the current plant throughput has decreased to 6.5 million tonnes per year. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, carbon in leach tanks, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit and a tailings disposal facility. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, an ongoing development project, will expand the existing plant by approximately 3.5 million tonnes per year through the installation of a new crusher, a single stage SAG mill and two leach tanks."

      "Younger granitic intrusions occur and there is evidence of mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusive bodies (gabbroic or diorite). North of the Mashonga Mine the Igara rocks are covered unconformably by Buhweju Group quartzites and conglomerates of the MesoProterozoic Karagwe-Ankolean System. North-south trending fold axes from isoclinal folded sequences are reported as well as N-S and E-W trending structures (shears?). The drainages in the mine area trend southeast, suggesting there is a regional structure parallel to this. The Buganda-Toro and Karagwe-Ankolean systems have been extensively folded into tight synclines and anticlines, with upright axial planes and, in the southern and central Mashonga area, the former has been intruded by synorogenic porphyritic gneissic adamellites to post-orogenic biotite-bearing alkaline granites and leucocratic, sub-alkaline, per-aluminous granites (\u201ctin granites\u201d). Historical economic Sn, tungsten (\u201cW\u201d), beryllium (\u201cBe\u201d), niobium (\u201cNb\u201d)/tantalum (\u201cTa\u201d) deposits occur in similar rocks to the south of the Mashonga Property, hosted within the metasediments on the periphery of the granites. The presence of\n\t\t\t\tabundant quartz veining, several gold occurrences and the Sn-W-Be-Ta mineralization in this environment support the typical hydrothermal and epithermal activity of the Intrusive-Related Gold model driving the exploration. Informal gold production from the Mashonga Mine is reported to come from an east-west trending sheared quartz-vein zone. The mineralized shear appears to be hosted by quartz-muscovite schist, at the contact between the schist and granitic rock. The wallrock of the mine pit, much of which is now filled by slumped material, is comprised of schist and kaolinitized granite with pegmatitic veins and quartz stockwork veining. In addition a quartz-mica schist that may be a recrystallized mafic (or ultramafic) rock was observed by Magnus and the author of the Mashonga Technical Report on the mine dumps that are reported to come from the pit/underground workings."

      "Both drill holes encountered blind near surface mineralization adjacent to structures that had been previously recognized and drilled. The 2006 drilling program was successful in expanding the known target areas and finding new areas of near-surface, low grade gold and silver. The new intercepts in the \u201cC\u201d resource area (H0604 and H0605), and the West Cliffs zone (H0606 through 0608) combined with the intercepts from the 2005 drilling program in the \u201cA\u201d area indicate potential for an increase in the historic target zones. Drilling in the north central area also provided new evidence for increasing targets (H0609 and 0610). The interpretation of the 2006 drilling results also suggests faults previously believed to dip to the east may roll to the west at relatively shallow depth. This finding coupled with the potential for increase of near-surface resources indicates changes are necessary to the exploration philosophy at Hercules. Previously, the historic drilling had concentrated on the east side of the structures, defining the shallow resources in \u201cA\u201d through \u201cC\u201d. The recent holes drilled in the 2005 and 2006 exploration programs suggest further near-surface targets are likely to be developed within the \u201cA\u201d through \u201cC\u201d areas, the West Cliffs hanging wall and the central core between these two areas. The topography is relatively flat allowing for an inexpensive, shallow drilling program. Drilling to depth on the structural zones remains a significant target for developing high grade resources at depth. Because of the interpretation of the deeper drill holes completed during this program, it is recommended that the next set of deep holes on the property should be drilled from west to east on the northeastern veins within the \u201cB\u201d to \u201cC\u201d resource areas. The interpretation of the recent drilling suggests that the veins may roll over developing dips of near vertical to westerly at depths of less than 500 feet. During 2007 the Company conducted a drill program that was completed in March 2008."

      "Due to the significant number of individual deeds, leases and similar instruments involved in the acquisition and development of the Royalty Properties by us or our predecessors, acreage amounts are subject to change as new information becomes available. In addition, as a royalty owner, our access to information concerning activity and operations on the Royalty Properties is limited. Most of our producing properties are subject to old leases and other contracts pursuant to which we are not entitled to well information. Some of our newer leases provide for access to technical data and other information. We may have limited access to public data in some areas through third party subscription services. Consequently, the exact number of wells producing from, or drilling on the Royalty Properties is not determinable. The primary manner by which we will become aware of activity on the Royalty Properties is the receipt of division orders or other correspondence from operators or purchasers. Acreage Summary\nThe following table sets forth as of December 31, 2005 a summary of our gross and net, where applicable, acres of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests, and a compilation of the number of counties and parishes and states in which these interests are located. The majority of our net mineral acres are unleased. Acreage amounts may not add across due to overlapping ownership among categories. Our net interest in production from royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests is based on lease royalty and other third party contractual terms which vary from property to property. Consequently, net acreage ownership in these categories is not determinable. Our net interest in production from properties in which we own a royalty or overriding royalty interest may be affected by royalty terms negotiated by the mineral interest owners in such tracts and their lessees. Our interest in the majority of these properties is perpetual in nature. However, a minor portion of the properties are subject to terms and conditions pursuant to which a portion of our interest may terminate upon cessation of production."

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Uranium mineralization at the Anderson Project occurs exclusively in the sequence of Miocene-age lacustrine lakebed sediments. The lacustrine sediments unconformably overlie the andesitic volcanic unit over most of the Anderson Project. However, to the east of the Anderson Project, they overlie the felsic to intermediate volcanic unit. Evidence suggests that deposition of the lacustrine sediments occurred in a restricted basin less than 5 km wide by 10 to 12 km long on the northern edge of an old Paleogene lake. Moving southward, these sediments inter-tongue with siltstones and sandstones. The lakebed sediments represent time-transgressive facies deposited within a narrow, probably shallow, basinal feature. This type of depositional environment exhibits complex relationships between individual facies, lensing out, vertical and horizontal gradation, and interfingering. The lake sediments include green siltstones and mudstones, white calcareous siltstones, and silty limestone or calcareous tuffaceous material. Much of this material is silicified to varying extents and was derived in part from volcanic ashes and tuffs common throughout the lakebeds. Also present in the lacustrine sequence are zones of carbonaceous siltstone and lignitic material. Along the boundary between the former MinEx and Urangesellschaft properties, drill holes encounter the basal arkosic sandstone. To the south and southwest, lakebeds interfinger with and eventually are replaced by a thick, medium to coarse-grained, arkosic sandstone unit. Mineralization\nUranium mineralization in outcrops and the pit floor at the old Anderson mine was reported by the US Bureau of Mines in Salt Lake City as tyuyamunite (Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2\u00b75-8H2O). Carnotite (K(UO2)2(VO4)2\u00b73H2O) and a rarer silicate mineral, weeksite (K2(UO2)2(Si2O5)3\u00b74H2O), were also reported in outcrop samples. Carnotite mineralization occurs as fine coatings and coarse fibrous fillings along fractures and bedding planes and has been noted in shallow drill holes and surface exposures."

      "The State Engineer exercises jurisdiction over underground water basins with \"reasonably ascertainable boundaries.\" Accordingly, new appropriations or changes in purpose or place of use or points of diversion of existing water rights, such as those in the San Juan and Gallup Basins where the Company's properties are located, must be obtained by permit from the State Engineer. Applications are required to be published and are subject to hearing if protested. There are three criteria for decision, that the application: (1) not impair existing water rights, (2) not be contrary to the conservation of water within New Mexico, and (3) not be detrimental to the public welfare. Applications may be approved subject to conditions that govern exercise of the water rights. Appeals from decisions of the State Engineer are to the district court of the county in which the work or point of desired appropriation is situated and from there to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Finally, jurisdiction over water rights may become an issue in New Mexico when an Indian nation, such as the Navajo Nation, objects to the State Engineer's authority to grant or transfer a water right or to award a temporary water right, claiming tribal jurisdiction over Indian country. This issue could result in litigation between the Indian nation and the state which may delay action on water right applications, and, depending on who prevails as to any particular property, could result in a requirement to make applications to the appropriate Indian nation and continuing jurisdiction by the Indian nation over use of the water. All of the foregoing issues arise to a greater or lesser extent in connection with the Company's New Mexico properties. There can be no assurance that the regulatory permits or licenses in Texas or New Mexico, or the applications for water rights in New Mexico, required for any project of the Company will be approved by the necessary governing authority in the form contemplated by management, or in any other form, or within the time periods necessary to commence timely production."

We also did not carry out any gold recovery operations in 2008 and 2009, as we focused on the lode exploration program. During the winter of 2005, Silverado began an underground exploration and development program on the Swede Channel. Continuing into 2006, Silverado installed about 900 feet of exploration drifts by underground tunneling methods into the Swede Channel. Prior bulk sampling had shown the channel to contain gold in the basal gravels, so the project was designed to obtain a large bulk sample from the tunnel being advanced into the channel. The 2005-2006 winter stockpile contained 8,896 LCY of gravel material, and was processed between June 28th through July 20th of 2006, yielding 939.07 troy ounces of gold nuggets and dust. The Swede portal was re-opened in early November of 2006, and gravel extraction on the remaining sections of the Swede Channel continued until its completion by the middle of January 2007. A total of 8,963 LCY of gravel material was stockpiled from the remaining Swede Channel.

      "Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet. The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately 20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the north-east. Such an area has the potential of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir. In the southern part of PEL 115, interpretation of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra and Thunderbolt). In the northern part of PEL 115 two Jurassic prospects have been identified (Avro and Skyhawk) and three Permian prospects known as the Delta, Hurricane and Metear. No drilling dates have been announced for these prospects.\nCOOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - QUEENSLAND\nATP 267\nAn eleven well exploration, appraisal and development drilling campaign began in early 2007 on ATP 267 under which the Company holds an overriding royalty interest of 17.15% of 1%.

We are in the process of consolidating the ownership of a portion of the Hoosac/North Amselco project that is currently held by another party. South Eureka Exploration\nWe are of the opinion that the South Eureka property has excellent potential for continued exploration success both at the deposit scale and on the regional scale. The current Lookout Mountain mineralization is defined over a relatively small area at the north end of a mineralized structural corridor that extends for several thousand feet across the property, and up to 4 to 5 kilometers (2.5 to 3 miles) in strike length. This structure hosts several areas of drill indicated mineralization and the exploration potential in this corridor is strong, as evidenced by historic drilling, and soil and rock geochemical analyses."

The now remaining three permits of the Browse Joint Venture, WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P are contiguous and are located offshore in the eastern Browse Basin. They cover a total area of 9,460 km(2) (2,336,620 acres). The Browse Basin region is a major proven hydrocarbon area and it forms a part of the extensive series of continental margin sedimentary basins that, together, comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia. The Browse Basin has been host to a series of major gas, gas condensate and oil discoveries which began with the 1971 discovery at Scott Reef-1. The Browse Basin is currently the focus for two proposals to establish new LNG export facilities; one by Woodside Energy Ltd in relation to the Torosa/Brecknock/Calliance complex and the other by Inpex Corporation in relation to the Ichthys complex. Two of the Browse Joint Venture permits are presently lightly explored. There is one well on the boundary of WA-332-P (Prudhoe-1), one well in WA-333-P (Rob Roy-1), and a total of fourteen wells in WA-342-P, mostly associated with the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation. In the first three year term of the Permits, the Browse Joint Venture has obtained available open file reports and basic 2D and 3D seismic data acquired by the earlier efforts of previous explorers. This included approximately 1,100 km(2) of high quality 3D seismic known as the Cornea 3D survey which is held by the Browse Joint Venture. Approximately 1,000 km(2) of this 3D data set was reprocessed by the joint venture during the 2007 year. The 3D data set has been integrated with the acquisition and processing of the Braveheart 2D seismic survey. The Browse Joint Venture previously acquired the Braveheart seismic survey of approximately 1,949 line km of new 2D seismic survey over these Browse Joint venture permits. The Browse Joint Venture has elected to enter a second three year permit term in which it presently is planning for the drilling of Braveheart 1 in WA-333-P. Active geological and geophysical evaluation of all of the Browse Joint Venture Permits is continuing, with special studies having been carried out in respect to the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation (in WA-342-P) and the Braveheart project, which straddles both WA-332-P and WA-333-P.\nBrowse Joint Venture\nThe Browse Joint Venture, which comprises WA-332-P and WA-333-P, on March 19, 2008, applied for an 18-months suspension and extension of Year 5 of permit WA-332-P in order to acquire further new infill 2D seismic survey over potential leads in WA-332-P and to secure a drilling vessel."

Periods of freezing temperatures are generally quite brief and infrequent. Tropical weather from the Gulf of Mexico can occur during the hurricane season and may affect the site area with heavy rain storms. The infrequent freezing weather and abnormally heavy rainfalls are the primary conditions that could cause temporary shutdowns at an operating ISR mine.

Sufficient electric power is believed to be available in the area, however new lines may be needed to bring additional service to a plant site and well fields. Within a 20-mile radius of the planned Burke Hollow facility there is sufficient population to supply the necessary number of suitable mining personnel. History\nThe earliest historic uranium exploration at the Burke Hollow Project was the drilling of five exploration holes completed on the Welder lease by Nufuels (Mobil) in 1982. Oxidation/reduction interfaces were intercepted in two of the holes and oxidized tails were logged in three of the holes. In 1993 Total Minerals conducted a short reconnaissance exploration drilling program and completed a total of 12 exploration holes of which 11 intersected anomalous gamma ray log signatures indicative of uranium mineralization. The resulting 12 log files include good quality electric logs, with each log file containing a detailed lithological report based on drill hole cuttings prepared by Total Mineral\u2019s field geologists who were supervising and monitoring the drilling activity contemporaneously. All of the boreholes were drilled using contracted truck-mounted drilling rigs. The holes were drilled by conventional rotary drilling methods using drilling mud fluids.

      "A utility\u2019s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utility\u2019s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (ii) such utility\u2019s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. The rates of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCO\u2019s base rates are capped, subject to certain adjustments, at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists in Virginia. Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility\u2019s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The option to purchase the surface rights covers approximately 5,670 acres over the mining lease and the additional acreage adequate to site all potential heap leaching and processing operations as currently anticipated by the Company. We may exercise the option for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the sixteen year primary term of the mineral lease. The option can be kept current by an annual payment of $10,000. The purchase price will be the appraised value of the surface at the time of exercising the option. The ground water lease secures our right to develop the ground water within a 13,120 acre lease area located approximately 4 miles from the Round Top deposit. The lease area contains five existing water wells. It is anticipated that all potential water needs for the Round Top Project mine operations will be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease has an annual minimum production payment of $5,000 prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production we will pay $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect. Existing Infrastructure\nThe Round Top rare earth prospect was initially developed in the late 1980s as a beryllium resource. As a result, several pieces of equipment were present at the property when we acquired the lease, some of which we have repaired as described below. The previous operators had also built out several roads at the prospect site, which we believe are suitable for our current exploration plans. There exists on the Round Top site a 1,115 foot, 10 foot by 10 foot decline from the surface into the Round Top prospect. There are steel sets every five feet, in some cases less, and the entire working is lagged with timber. There are \u201cescape holes\u201d at intervals to allow personnel to avoid equipment. The escape holes are all in good operating condition. There is also a 36 foot steel ventilation line in place that runs for approximately 75 feet into the prospect."

    "documentation": [
      "The gathering subsidiary gathers and transports the gas to a third-party processor, which processes the gas and pays XTO Energy and other producers for at least 50% of the liquids processed. After the gas is processed, the gathering subsidiary transports the gas via a residue pipeline to a connection with an interstate pipeline. The gathering subsidiary sells the residue gas to the marketing subsidiary of XTO Energy based upon a published index price. The gathering subsidiary pays this price to XTO Energy less a compression and gathering fee of approximately $0.31 per Mcf of residue gas. This gathering fee was previously approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when the gathering subsidiary was regulated. During 2008, the gathering system collected approximately 12,500 Mcf per day from 320 wells, approximately 50% of which XTO Energy operates. Estimated capacity of the gathering system is 28,000 Mcf per day. The gathering subsidiary also provides contract operating services to properties in Woodward County, collecting approximately 11,300 Mcf per day from 127 wells, for an average fee of approximately $0.05 per Mcf.\nXTO Energy also sells gas directly to its marketing subsidiary, which then sells the gas to third parties. The price paid to XTO Energy is based upon the weighted average price of several published indices, but does not include a deduction for any marketing fees. The price paid by the marketing affiliate includes a deduction for any transportation fees charged by the third party. Green River Basin The Green River Basin is located in southwestern Wyoming. Natural gas was discovered in the Fontenelle Field of the Green River Basin in the early 1970s. The producing reservoirs are the Frontier, Baxter and Dakota sandstones. Daily 2008 sales volumes from the underlying properties in the Fontenelle Field averaged 20,600 Mcf of natural gas and 43 Bbls of oil. In 2008, XTO Energy completed 7 gross (7.0 net) wells and performed 9 workovers. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not plan to drill any new wells and will perform up to 6 workovers in the Green River Basin during 2009."

From time to time, these companies re-estimate the cost of decommissioning and apply to FERC for increased rates in response to increased decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee has filed a decommissioning financing plan under a Maine statute which requires the establishment of a decommissioning trust fund. That statute also provides that if the trust has insufficient funds to decommission the plant, the licensee (Maine Yankee) is responsible for the deficiency and, if the licensee is unable to provide the entire amount, the \"owners\" of the licensee are jointly and severally responsible for the remainder. The definition of \"owner\" under the statute includes Montaup and may include companies affiliated with Montaup. The applicability and effect of this statute cannot be determined at this time. Montaup would seek to recover through its rates any payments that might be required (see Yankee Atomic, below). Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Unit 1. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone Unit 3 is $15.1 million in 1993 dollars, and Seabrook Unit 1 is $10.6 million in 1993 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Yankee Atomic:\nOn February 26, 1992, Yankee Atomic announced that it would permanently cease power operation of Yankee Rowe and began preparing for an orderly decommissioning of the facility.

Gold was analyzed by fire assay and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry finish and a four acid sample digestion with Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry method was used to analyze a full suite of elements.

Strachan, Certified Professional Geologist and Goldrich\u2019s contracted project manager for Chandalar, managed the drill program and confirmed that all procedures, protocols and methodologies used in the drill program conform to industry standards. The results of this first diamond core exploration drilling on our Chandalar gold property have exposed what we believe is a wide-spread system of gold mineralization at intervals from surface to depths of up to 120 meters (about 400 feet). We also believe the mass of rock affected by the mineralizing system to be large, as more than 50 gold showings are scattered over about six square miles (fifteen square kilometers), only a fraction of which has yet been drill-tested.

Each of the calendar quarters are phased programs whereby results from Q1 (phase 3) in 2013 must justify the continuation of activities in Q2 (phase 4) and likewise for Q4 (phase 5) for 2013."

Contact District\nAllied Nevada, through the acquisition from Vista of the F. W. Lewis, Inc. properties, owns wholly or in fractional interest 110 patented claims in the Contact mining district in northeast Elko County, Nevada. We also staked 307 unpatented claims adjacent to the patented claims in early July 2007. There are no royalties associated with our ownership of both the patented and unpatented mining claims. The small settlement of Contact is located approximately 52 miles north of Wells, Nevada and 16 miles south of Jackpot, Nevada. The mining district is immediately west of the town of Contact and extends for several miles west and southwest of town. The mining district, referred to as either the \u201cContact\u201d or \u201cSalmon River\u201d district, was discovered in the early 1870s and was first worked for gold and silver. However, copper was soon discovered and the vast majority of the historic work in the district has been directed toward the development and production of copper ores. Early work in the district was hampered by the inaccessibility of the area and the resultant high shipping costs for any ore produced. The later construction of the railroad eliminated this problem, but falling copper prices in the 1930s caused the district to cease production. The district saw a renewed period of activity in the 1940s and early 1950s, but little true exploration work was done and most efforts were directed toward mining already known ore deposits. More recently, various companies have looked at the district for precious metals in the 1980s and 1990s, and higher copper and molybdenum prices have recently renewed interest in those prospects. Geology\nThe area is underlain by a granodiorite batholith and related rocks of Mesozoic age which intruded a Late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of shale and limestone. Contact metamorphism and metasomatism produced skarns and hornfels in the sediments up to a mile away from the contact zone."

However, the region was worked on as early as 1688 and recently sporadic production has taken place from gold-rich zones adjacent to the San Simon Property by a number of local miners. It is estimated that they are removing approximately two kilograms of gold per day by using crude mining methods. The 1996 field program consisted of soil geochem and stream concentrate sampling conducted by the Company and Barrick. Geologists from Activation Laboratories (ACT) completed two soil geochem lines on the north-south arm of the Machetero I claim. These samples were sent to the ACT lab for enzyme leach testing. The results of stream concentrate samples detected three highly anomalous samples on the Machetero I claim block. Planned 1997 Activities: - ------------------------\nThe Companies are actively seeking a joint venture partner to help exploit the San Simon property. Several companies are currently reviewing the data. In addition, the Companies plan to do further field work this summar which will include stream concentrate sampling and geochem and rock sampling and mapping to delineate drill targets. MONTANA PROPERTIES\nThe Company holds various interests in a number of properties in the State of Montana. There are no obligations for underlying payments other than annual state fees to the State of Montana. The Company has not conducted any exploration work in 1996 on these properties.

      "The gold-in-soil anomalies appear to correlate with an interpreted contact between the Birimian volcanoclastics and metasediments. Further Exploration Work\nOn April 27, 2005, we further contracted with CME to conduct a second stage exploration program at our Banso and Muoso Project located at the Banso and Muoso concessions. The work program included detailed grid establishment and soil sampling, ground magnetometer surveying, updating the geodatabase and recommendations for future work. The purpose of this program was to determine areas of gold mineralization at the Banso and Muoso concessions that can be followed up with induced polarization surveys, trenching and diamond drilling. Fieldwork included the following:\nGrid Establishment\nGrid placement was based on the results from the 2004 regional work program. Four grids were established in the areas of primary interest, one on the Muoso concession and three on the Banso concession. The grids on the latter concession are referred to as Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3. Soil Sampling\nSoil sampling was undertaken along all grid lines established during this work program. From the 6,961 established stations, 177 locations were not sampled due to possible contamination from villages, streams and/or swamps. A total of 6,516 samples were submitted for gold and 6,066 samples for arsenic analyses. A breakdown of the gold results per property area includes:\n- 20 -\nResults, Interpretation and Conclusions\nSoil sample geochemistry has been completed over selected portions of the anomalous zones indicated by the 2004 regional sampling program. Work during the 2005 program suggests the presence of a bedrock source within both the Muoso and Banso concessions. Values greater than the threshold value (mean + 2 standard deviations) of 0.063 ppm gold are considered to be anomalous. The term \u201cppm\u201d represents \u201cpart per million\u201d where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb). On the Muoso concession 284 samples (9%) out of the 3,318 samples submitted for gold analyses yielded values greater than the threshold value; while at Banso 152 samples (5%) out of the 3,198 samples submitted for gold analyses yielded values greater than the 0.063 ppm Au threshold value."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. Wellhead sales of domestic natural gas are not subject to regulation. Consequently, sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation, and sales. In addition, the FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation of the natural gas industry. The ultimate impact of the rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial decisions and final decisions by the FERC. New proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts."

      "In March 2004, Mr. Harvey and his affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with Calais which, among other things, included a more precise definition of Calais\u2019 right (which expires August 31, 2011, but can be extended for an additional ten years if AAI\u2019s right to convert the debenture is extended as well) to repurchase the interest of AAI in the Caribou prospect, including the payment of Cdn$747,728 for the reacquisition, and AAI\u2019s right to convert that debenture before it is paid. That agreement, also defined Calais\u2019 right to borrow against, enter in and upon the mineral interests in the Caribou prospect owned by AAI, construct buildings and mines on those prospects, and remove and sell minerals from Caribou for Calais\u2019 own account. The unpatented mining claims are located on federal lands and are subject to federal as well as state jurisdiction, and the requirements of the U.S. General Mining Law. Patented and unpatented claims are listed in Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report. We are engaged in the location of additional unpatented mining claims. There is no guarantee that additional federal lands will remain open to location, or that the General Mining Law will not be repealed or amended. Repeated attempts have been made in Congress over recent decades to repeal or to modify the General Mining Law. The vast majority of exploration to date on Calais\u2019 lands has taken place on patented claims. Under the General Mining Law, as amended, unpatented claims may only be validly located by the making of a discovery, within the meaning of that law, upon open lands within the exterior boundaries of the claims. Though mineralization has been encountered on some of the unpatented claims, there can be no guarantee that there is a valid discovery on any of those claims. The patenting of mining claims, done with relative ease during the period 1872-1920, is now very difficult, and most patent applications are either suspended or prohibited from being filed. Thus, there is no likelihood for the acquisition of a fee title to any of the unpatented lands, and unpatented claims now held are held subject to potentially adverse changes in laws and regulations governing them."

      "All of the uranium mining properties at Sheep Mountain are currently shut down with limited reclamation activities. Monitoring and reporting work continues to keep the permits current. There is no operating uranium mill near Sheep Mountain, but Rio Tinto owns the Sweetwater Mill (which is on standby) some 30 miles south of Sheep Mountain. The ultimate economics of mining the Sheep Mountain properties through underground working will depend on access to a mill. Over a period of at least 24 months, substantial work would be required to put the Sheep Mountain uranium mines into production, including permitting, cleaning rock and other debris from shafts and tunnels, pumping water out of the mines, extending shafts and tunnels, and further drill sampling to ascertain whether a commercially viable ore body exists on any of the properties. We have recorded reclamation liabilities for the Sheep Mountain properties (see note K to the consolidated financial statements). No historical costs from the Sheep Mountain properties are on the balance sheet of USE at December 31, 2006. Current permits are in place for standby maintenance and reclamation of the mines.\n\u00b7 Arizona\nOn August 22, 2005, the Company and UPC signed an agreement to add two more uranium projects to their joint venture (Burro Canyon in Colorado and Breccia Pipes located in Arizona). The latter project involves properties in the Arizona Strip, in northern Arizona. This property consists of 54 lode mining claims (Star and Java claims) on BLM land in Mohave and Coconino counties, Arizona. The exploration targets on these properties are known as Breccia Pipes uranium deposits. These properties were acquired by the Company pursuant to an agreement with Nu Star Exploration, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement between the Company and UPC, UPC will earn a 50% interest in the project by contributing the first $500,000 in acquisition and exploration expenses for the project (but still, UPC will have to complete its payments under the Purchase and Sale Agreement generally, to hold the 50% interest in the project)."

The following describes the Company\u2019s historical extraction and analysis of samples from the El Capitan Property. Over the years, samples taken on the El Capitan Property, including samples taken by ECL, have given low-grade precious metal results when using standard fire assay methods. Through August 2006, due to the unique nature of the mineralization of the El Capitan Property, we have at times utilized testing and assaying methods that may be uncommon, including the use of alkali fusion assays, a more aggressive form of assay which completely converts the sample into a water soluble salt. In January 2005, ECL completed a preliminary 32-sample surface sampling and assay program on the El Capitan Property to determine the property\u2019s gold and platinum potential. This preliminary sampling was completed by Dr. Clyde L.

    "documentation": [
      "In a typical hedging transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference. The Company would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether the Company's production was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. In addition, the index used to calculate the floating price in a hedge is frequently not the same as the prices actually received for the production hedged. The difference (referred to as basis differential) may be material, and may reduce the benefit or increase the detriment caused by a particular hedge. There is not an established pricing index for hedges of California heavy crude oil production, and the cash market for heavy oil production in California tends to vary widely from index prices typically used in oil hedges. Consequently, prior to 2000, hedging California heavy crude oil was particularly subject to the risks associated with volatile basis differentials. In February 2000, the Company entered into a 15-year contract, effective January 1, 2000, to sell all of its current and future California crude oil production to Tosco Corporation. The contract provides pricing based on a fixed percentage of the NYMEX crude oil price for each type of crude oil that Nuevo produces in California. While the contract does not reduce the Company's exposure to price volatility, it does effectively eliminate the basis differential risk between the NYMEX price and the field price of the Company's California oil production, thereby facilitating Nuevo's ability to hedge its realized prices.

The form of titanium found in the mineral rutile.\nTITANIUM: a widely distributed dark grey metallic element, (Ti), found in small quantities in many minerals. The mineral ilmenite, (FeTiO3), is currently the principal feedstock for the production of titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder and titanium metal. Location and Access\nThe Cerro Blanco property is located approximately 39 kilometers, or approximately 24 miles, west of the city of Vallenar in the Atacama geographic region (Region III) of northern Chile and southwest of the Cerro Rodeo Mining District. Access to the property is as follows: The main Ruta 5, the Pan American Highway, runs north from Santiago for approximately 665 kilometers to Vallenar; from there a paved road runs west toward the Port of Huasco for a distance of 22 kilometers to the village of Nicolasa; at Nicolasa a municipally maintained dirt road runs approximately 10 kilometers southwest to the property. Management believes access to the property is adequate to accommodate the type of vehicles and traffic during the exploration stage on the property. Improvements to the dirt road will be required for the development and production stages. These improvements will include widening of the road and topping it with gravel. Management believes adequate supplies of bedrock and gravel are available for this purpose, although it currently has no arrangements or agreements to provide either the improvement services or supplies."

      "Since 2013 the most important work conducted consisted of continued access road construction and metallurgical testing. All work performed by us, Cominco, and Nexa was done by direct employees of the respective companies with the exception of the drilling, underground tunneling, helicopter services and road building, all of which were performed by third-party contractors under the direction of Cominco and Nexa. 6. Mineralization\nMineralization occurs as massive to semi-massive replacements of sphalerite and galena localized by specific sedimentary facies (rock strata) within the limestone stratigraphy and by structural feeders and karst breccias. More than three-quarters of mineralization is sulfide-dominant with the remainder being oxide-dominant. A total of 11 preferred beds for replacement mineralization have been located within the middle unit of the Chambara Formation. Mineralization is associated with the conversion of limestone to dolomite, which creates porosity and permeability within the rock formations, promoting the passage of mineralizing fluids through the rock formations forming stratigraphically controlled near-horizontal manto deposits. Drilling of stratigraphic targets has shown that certain coarser-grained facies of the stratigraphy are the best hosts for manto mineralization. Stratigraphically controlled mineralization is typically one to several meters in thickness, but often attains thicknesses of five to ten meters. The laterally extensive manto deposits are strongly related to, and potentially originate from, structurally controlled near-vertical conduits for mineralizing solutions. Replacement deposits occur along these high-angle structures as well as in the stratigraphic mantos at Florida Canyon. Karst features are localized along the feeder faults and locally produce \"breakout zones\" where mineralization may extend vertically across thick stratigraphic intervals where collapse breccias have been replaced by ore minerals. Mineralized karst structures are up to 50 meters in width (horizontal), up to 100 meters vertically, and up to hundreds of meters along strike."

      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nBLOCKBUSTER VIDEO BUILDING\nOn February 26, 1991, the Company purchased a commercial building, located in Huntington Beach, California. Constructed in 1991, the building is one-story, has a total of 5,200 rentable square feet and is located on an 18,225 square foot parcel of land. The building is located in Orange County, California, which has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in California, based on its stable base of employers ranging from big businesses to smaller retailers. The Building was originally acquired for cash in 1991 for a total acquisition cost of $1,676,210. In February 1994, the Company financed the Building by incurring mortgage debt secured by the Building for $600,000. The loan is amortized over a twenty-five year period and is due February 1, 2004. The monthly payment is currently $4,934 per month with a current interest rate of 8.25%. The building and improvements are depreciated over 31.5 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and income tax basis for the property are the same. In the opinion of the General Partner, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. (\"WCRM\" or \"the Property Manager\"), an affiliate of the Company. The building is 100% occupied by one tenant, Blockbuster Video, through 2001, on a triple net lease. The tenant's lease calls for rental payments of $13,416 per month for the remaining years of the lease. This is equivalent to $2.58 per rentable square foot. This lease requires the tenant to pay insurance, taxes, maintenance, and all other operating costs. The Advisor believes the tenant has the ability to meet its lease obligation.

      "In North Dakota, we maintain transmission facilities to interconnect with electric transmission lines of other utilities and share in the ownership of Coyote I Electric Generating Plant (`Coyote'), located near Beulah, North Dakota. In Iowa, we share in the ownership of Neal Electric Generating Unit No. 4 (`Neal'), located near Sioux City, Iowa. These facilities are fueled by coal, which is provided through various length contracts with several coal companies. We are evaluating additional generation which will provide adequate generating capacity reserves through the year 2000. Currently, we have capacity options for the years 2001-2007. Because the cost of capacity has risen significantly and also because of the reduced availability of capacity in the future, NorthWestern Public Service is developing a comprehensive plan to assure that it has sufficient capacity to meet customer needs and the reserve requirements of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (`MAPP'). Capability and Demand\nAs of December 31, 1998, the aggregate net summer peaking capacity of all NorthWestern Public Service-owned electric generating units was 308,289 kw, consisting of 104,420 kw from Big Stone (our 23.4% share), 42,700 kw from Coyote (our 10.0% share), 54,169 kw from Neal (our 8.7% share), and 107,000 kw from internal combustion turbine units and small diesel units, used primarily for providing electric power during peak demand periods. In addition to those plant facilities, we have entered into agreements to purchase up to 14,950 kw of firm capacity from Basin Electric Cooperative and various amounts from Nebraska Public Power District to assist in meeting peak demands. We are a summer peaking utility. The 1998 peak demand of 276,976 kw occurred on July 14, 1998. Total system capability at the time of peak was 333,589 kw. The reserve margin for 1998 was 20%. The minimum reserve margin requirement as determined by the members of the MAPP, of which we are a member, is 15%. MAPP is an area power pool arrangement consisting of utilities and power suppliers having transmission interconnections located in a 9-state area in the north central region of the United States and in two Canadian provinces."

The column leach testing results are described in greater detail below under the section heading \u201cProperties - Round Top Project - Metallurgy\u201d. On December 23, 2013, we published a revised version of the June 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment (the \u201cRevised PEA\u201d) based on a 20,000 tonne per day heap leach operation using a conventional element separation plant. The mineralized material estimate was recalculated to include uranium, niobium, tantalum and tin. The Revised PEA assesses the potential economic viability of the simplified and \"scaled down\u201d operation which we believe is a much better fit with the present rare earth market. Cautionary Note to Investors: The PEA and Revised PEA have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \u201cCIM\u201d) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended.

      "Results from both these areas have been encouraging with drilling to continue in 2006. A deep surface hole at Bondaye was initiated during 2004 to test the down plunge extension of high grade mineralization to approximately 250 meters below the extent of current historical workings. Although technical problems and delays were seen in 2004, the drilling was completed mid 2005 for a total of 2,109 meters including a parent hole to 1,604 meters and a \"wedged\" daughter hole to 1,504 meters. Only spotty, discontinuous gold mineralization was encountered in the reef zone at both the parent and daughter hole. However this may simply reflect the typical \"pinch and swell\" character of the Prestea reef system and cannot be considered a definitive test of the Bondaye plunge potential. Total spending on long term assets at Prestea Underground totaled $12.1 million in 2005, up from $7.1 million during 2004. Spending in 2005 included $2.6 million on underground drilling and other geological activities, $5.8 million on feasibility work, $2.3 million on dewatering, security and site maintenance, and $1.4 million on equipment purchases. Support crews continue to maintain the underground and surface facilities in good working order and assist the underground drilling teams. By the end of 2005, dewatering efforts had cleared the lowest sections of the old underground workings and an extensive underground drilling program has been initiated which will continue during most of 2006 to test areas immediately below the deepest old workings. We believe these deeper levels provide the best opportunities for significant new discoveries in the Prestea Underground. We intend to complete an initial feasibility study by the end of 2006 evaluating the economic potential of restarting production from the Prestea Underground mine.

      "Net Leases - We typically enter into net leases with our tenants. \u201cNet leases\u201d are leases that typically require tenants to pay all or a majority of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance and building repairs related to the property, in addition to base rent. Our leases do not contain material tenant concessions or rent abatements. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each contract will have different obligations for both the landlord and tenant. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property, and we have limited ability to revise the terms of leases for those tenants. We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties under which the lease terms have partially run. We evaluate the lease term risk based on criteria such as whether the property is in an attractive location, is difficult to replace or has other significant favorable real estate attributes. Some of our leases contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term and/or provide for percentage rent that can be calculated by a number of factors. Our leases generally require that each tenant obtain, at its own expense, property insurance naming the above parties as an insured party for fire and other casualty losses in an amount that generally equals the full replacement value of such property. Our tenants are generally required to obtain our General Partner\u2019s approval of all such insurance.

      "In the Deep Basin, plans call for 106 wells compared with 71 wells last winter. In Northeastern B.C., 93 wells are planned, compared with 73 the previous winter. In the Northern Plains, we expect to drill more than 100 wells this winter, compared with 76 wells a year ago. The Anderson acquisition in 2001 significantly strengthened Devon\u2019s holdings in the Deep Basin of Western Alberta. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devon\u2019s operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 193 total wells in the Deep Basin in 2004. Deep Basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. In 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production was limited to about 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension completed in 2003 allowed Devon to increase production from this area to about 30 MMcf per day. With\nthe pipeline extension complete, Devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area. Net production from the entire Foothills region is approximately 130 MMcf of gas per day. Devon also acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay. Production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in Canada and the United States. Various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade. Devon also drills for and produces \u201ccold-flow\u201d heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet."

      "These claims cover part of the deep potential at Main and the NE Main target. History: The Longstreet Property was discovered in the early 1900\u2019s, but had limited development work until 1929. A 1929 report and maps show development of the \u201cGolden Lion Mine\u201d on two levels spaced 75 meters apart vertically. The report indicates development of 300,000 tons of \u201cvein material\u201d averaging 0.20 oz/ton (6.8 g/t) gold and 8 oz/ton (274 g/t) silver. A mill was constructed, the remnants of which are still on the property. However, the small stopes underground indicate very little mining was done and the operation was abandoned. The property lay idle until 1980 when Keradamex Inc. and E & B Exploration formed a joint venture to explore the property. The venture conducted soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, limited underground sampling and drilled seven (one was abandoned) angle core holes into the Main mine workings area. This drilling revealed the presence of fracture related gold mineralization up to 36 meters thick extending into the hanging wall of the vein structure. In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing.

      "WUC acquired the property from Energy Fuels and currently holds the 146 claims in the project area. The San Rafael Uranium Project is currently being held as a property that is exploratory in nature with no identified reserves. Exploration and mining plans have not been prepared for the project. Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp. has not yet undertaken any development work at the property. Power and water sources have not yet been formally assessed. Magnum\u2019s acquisition of the claims and some of the data Magnum purchased encumbers the claims. This includes a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty to Uranium One, successor to Energy Metals for claims acquired by Magnum as earn-in to a JV, and a 2% net sales price royalty to Kelly Dearth on the BM claims. There is no royalty on the Hollie claims. The unpatented claims are located on approximately 2,900 acres of land administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in sections 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 35, T21S, R14E, SLPM, Emery County, Utah. Holding cost $22,630 due to BLM for claim maintenance fees prior to September 1 each year. Accessibility\nThe property is located on the eastern side of the San Rafael Swell in east-central Utah, approximately 140 air miles southeast of Salt Lake City. The little desert community of Green River, Utah is located about ten miles to the east. In a general sense the San Rafael Uranium Project property position lies within a wedge shaped area, roughly bound along its northeast edge by US Highway 6-50 and along its southeast edge by Interstate 70. Concerning additional local access features, U.S. Highway 6-50 crosses just north of the greater San Rafael Uranium Project area in a northwesterly direction and is roughly paralleled by the regional railroad line. Access to the property is generally good year around, except for periods of heavy snowstorms during December through February and increased monsoon rains and summer cloudburst storms during August through October. Access for drilling and other exploration activity is excellent, except during occasional heavy rainy periods which can create heavy flash flooding and roads mudding-up and becoming impassable."

    "documentation": [
      "No electrical power is required at this stage of exploration. Any electrical power that might be required in the foreseeable future could be supplied by gas powered portable generators. Property Geology\nThe Alice Claim is underlain by volcanics of the Yellowknife group, consisting of greenstone flows. These greenstones are fine to coarse grained and the flows vary in thickness up to 175 feet separated in places by tuffs and often on the western side by prominent flow breccia horizons. The lavas take the form of massive, pillowed, schistose, ropey and foliated flows, though distinction is often difficult as pillows have mostly been obscured. The tuffs that are contained in the flows vary in thickness up to 50 feet, and where sheared form sericite schist, whilst chlorite schist forms from the greenstones. The sericitc schist commonly weathers rusty brown due to the presence of pyrite and in some cases gold is associated with mineralization. A number of cherty bands and/or acid and/or acid dykes up to six feet thick occur on the property and often mineralization is associated with them. They may be rusty brown and have quartz veins nearby. These mineralized veins are to a large degree concentrated in a central zone running north/south through the property and the Alice zone, although associated with sheared tuff, lies within this larger area. Acid and intermediate tuffs occur on the western edge of the greenstone whilst on the eastern side the pyroclastic zone is of agglomerate often containing large bombs. Dykes and masses of intrusive diorite and gabbro are present though in some less exposed areas these may be confused with large grained or altered flows. The Alice shear is considered to contain the most promising gold mineralization on the property. This zone lies on the north side of a small lake known as Gold Lake and is exposed in outcrop and trenches for about 900 feet. The shear follows a band of chert-like inter-flow tuff that varies in thickness from a few inches to 6.5 feet."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "During 1998 Devon began to implement this plan by acquiring significant interests in both producing coalbed methane wells and undeveloped acreage. In addition, Devon drilled 86 new coalbed methane wells. By year-end 1998, the Company had an interest in 216,000 net acres and 202 coalbed methane wells. In addition, Devon has, together with a joint-venture partner, begun construction of a 126-mile gas gathering system. The gas gathering system is expected to begin initial operations by the fourth quarter of 1999. When it is fully developed, in 2001, this system will have an estimated capacity of 450 MMcf of gas per day and access to multiple interstate pipelines. It will provide adequate capacity to transport not only Devon's natural gas production, but also third party gas. Devon's total capital investment to the project is expected to be approximately $50 million for drilling 750 net wells over the next ten years and $50 to $150 million over the next three years for the development of the gathering system and facilities. Canadian Properties\nAll of Devon's Canadian properties are located within the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a large geologic feature encompassing portions of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. This basin feature forms a wedge-shaped depression that tapers from a maximum thickness of 17,000 feet on the western and southern margins to a zero edge along the northeast. Northern Alberta Properties. This area covers northern Alberta and a portion of northeastern British Columbia. The Northern Alberta properties are primarily gas producing properties, although both gas and oil is present in multiple formations at varying depths. A large portion of this region is thick bog that can be accessed by heavy equipment only when the ground is frozen (\"winter-only access\"). Therefore drilling and workover activity must be carefully planned to occur within the winter months, typically from mid-December through mid-March."

Expenditures by the Company reached a record $10,088,000 for development and exploration drilling primarily on its oil-oriented properties in the Williston Basin of Montana and natural gas prone areas east of Houston and in Webb and Zapata Counties near Laredo, Texas. However, the Austin Chalk trend of mid-Louisiana was a new province for Columbus' exploratory efforts and unfortunately, Columbus' share of the first well exceeded expected costs by over $1,500,000. Fortunately, exploratory and development activity in the onshore upper Gulf Coast area continued to be EGY's most successful core area from the standpoint of both crude oil and natural gas reserve and productivity additions. A review of the more significant operations follow below and have been segregated into Columbus' primary areas of operations. South Texas - Laredo Area - -------------------------\nAs the second most important source of lease level cash flow for the past several years, this area remains its most important as a source of operational income. The Company serves as operator of in excess of 100 natural gas wells in various fields from the southern city limits of Laredo to the B.R. Cox field in Jim Hogg, County, almost 80 miles to the south. Columbus owns working interests which range from 1% to 53% in the wells which it operates and less than 10% WI in those wells in which it does not operate. At least one drilling rig was utilized continuously throughout the year to drill infill and extension locations that had been identified by a 3-D seismic program conducted in 1995 and 1996.

Chicago\nOur Chicago facility, which we acquired on July 8, 2014, is the former Sun Times Press facility near downtown Chicago, Illinois. We are the fee simple owner of the Chicago facility. The facility consists of approximately 475,000 gross square feet, including approximately 28,000 raised floor operating NRSF and 24 MW of gross power capacity, with 8 MW of available utility power currently available and another 47 MW available upon request. The Chicago facility is included in our development pipeline, as we plan to convert the facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we placed approximately 14,000 raised floor NRSF into service. We placed an additional 14,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 21,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2017) approximately $20 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 354,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 167,000 would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 433,000 total operating NRSF with raised floor capacity of approximately 216,000 square feet and 37 MW of power.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Although mineralization continues downward into the underlying Triassic rocks, it is more tightly constrained to fractures that host higher-grade vein mineralization. The original Trinity silver deposit can generally be divided into two parts: a sulfide zone below the current pit and to the northeast, and an overlying oxide zone. Borax\u2019s mining in the late 1980s focused on a portion of the oxide zone. Mineralization occurs as oxidized and unoxidized sulfides in veinlets, as fracture-controlled mineralization, and as disseminations within the host rocks, including breccia matrix. Sulfide mineralization consists mainly of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, marcasite, and minor arsenopyrite with various silver minerals, including tetrahedrite-freibergite, pyrargyrite, minor argentite, and rare native silver, with traces of gold, pyrrhotite, stannite, and chalcopyrite. Low-grade lead and zinc have the potential to add value as byproducts. Index of Geologic Terms\nMining history\nThe following disclosure regarding the mining history of the Trinity Project has been derived from information contained in the Trinity Project Technical Report. The Trinity Project lies in the Trinity mining district, which had limited production of silver, lead, zinc, and gold from 1864 through 1942, primarily from the east side of the Trinity Range. In the vicinity of the Trinity project, which is located on the west side of the range, there was historic prospecting with unrecorded but presumed minor silver production. Minor exploration activity took place in the vicinity of the Trinity project in the 1950s, and in the 1960s Phelps Dodge Corporation completed trenching, IP surveying, and limited drilling in the area. U. S. Borax and Chemical Corp. (\u201cBorax\u201d) became interested in what is now the Trinity project in 1982 on the basis of reconnaissance geochemical sampling that indicated the presence of anomalous lead and silver in the Willow Canyon area. By 1984, Borax had acquired a property position and had entered into a joint venture with Southern Pacific Land Company (later Santa Fe Pacific Mining, Inc. (\u201cSFPM\u201d) and still later Newmont Mining Corp."

A license has a term of five years and requires the license holder to post a bond equal to 2% of the cost of the work commitments to secure the fulfillment of the work commitments. Licenses shall be based on map sections of scale equal to 1/50,000 (approximately 148,000 acres) or 1/25,000 (approximately 37,000 acres). A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments including the drilling of at least one well in each separate extension period and providing a bond to secure fulfillment of the additional work commitments. A final two-year term may be granted to appraise a petroleum discovery made during the prior terms. An additional six-month extension may be granted during any of the foregoing terms in order to complete the drilling or testing of a well. Once a discovery is made, the license holder may apply to convert part of the license area, covering the prospective petroleum field, to a production lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. Based on production level, the term of a lease is for between 5 and 20 years and may be extended up to 40 years in total. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease. The expiration dates reported on our exploration licenses and production leases below are subject to various extensions available under the old petroleum law and the new petroleum law. Those portions of exploration licenses with production are available during any term for conversion to a production lease with a term of between 5 and 20 years plus further extensions if production is maintained. We have converted some of our qualifying acreage into the new petroleum law regulations.

Our plan for 2009 was to carry out exploration and prepare for mining in the first half of the year, and start mining in the second half of the year and then supply ores to Qianzhen. Due to the decrease in the price of copper, Qingshan did not move on to mining in 2009.

      "The second transgressive stage of mineralization is characterized by veinlets or stockwork breccias which often have a gangue of tourmaline and lesser quartz with strong hematite. Strong copper mineralization was commonly observed on veinlets trending N20-35W and dipping 15 -35 SW. The overall orientation of the Moonlight deposit appears to be parallel to these gently southwest dipping fractures and indicates a good exploration target underneath the metavolcanics to the southwest. In addition to the mineralization in shallow dipping fractures, copper is contained on N-S steep to moderately E dipping, N60-75E steeply N dipping, N70-85W steeply south dipping veinlets. Although fracture hosted mineralization is widespread and often high grade at Moonlight, drilling to date has not revealed extensive vein-like structures similar to those mined at the Superior and Engels mines. The copper sulfides show a very strong vertical zonation, with chalcocite or digenite predominating in the upper levels of the deposit. With increasing depth, bornite predominates and chalcopyrite appears. Bornite is often observed to rim or cut chalcopyrite. Bornite and chalcopyrite are also observed to be cut by chalcocite veinlets. At the deeper levels chalcopyrite typically predominates in fracture hosted mineralization, but bornite is often still abundant. Magnetite can sometimes appear with hematite decreasing in abundance with depth. In rare cases pyrite will appear in veinlets at depth. Iron or magnesium-rich carbonates are also common in fracture hosted mineralization. Late stage copper-poor calcite and quartz veinlets that cut both preceding types of mineralization are also common. Sericitic, chloritic and albitic alteration has been observed to form halos around veinlets and breccia zones. Epidote becomes more abundant in and around veinlets with depth. Potassium feldspar is abundant but it is unclear how much is primary and how much is hydrothermal. In addition to the quartz, feldspar and 1-5% disseminated tourmaline that typically makes up the Lights Creek Quartz Monzonite, there is 2-8% finely disseminated hematite and magnetite."

In June 2001, Redwood LP contracted with Hanover Compression Limited Partnership (\u201cHanover\u201d) to fund, construct and operate a dedicated natural gas treatment plant with an initial designed capacity of 18 MMcf/d. In conjunction with the plant construction, Gateway installed field gathering lines and an approximately nine mile sales pipeline, with an estimated capacity of 70 MMcf/d, to transport the Madisonville gas to a major pipeline. These facilities were completed in April 2003 and production from the Magness Well commenced in May 2003. In July 2005, Madisonville Gas Processing LP (\u201cMGP\u201d) purchased the natural gas treatment plant from Hanover and purchased the gathering pipelines upstream of the gas treatment plant from Gateway. On December 31, 2008, we purchased the gas treatment plant and related gathering pipelines from MGP in exchange for the assumption of secured bank debt, payment of certain outstanding payables of MGP and shares of GeoPetro\u2019s common stock."

The following table sets forth the recovery method and certain additional information about the oil fields in the Los Angeles Basin included in the Underlying Properties:\n(1) Located in the East Beverly Hills field and includes the West Pico Unit and three Stocker JV wells (a joint venture between PCEC and Sentinel Peak). West Pico\nThe West Pico Unit was developed from an urban drilling and production site which came on production in 1966. In 2000, PCEC undertook a modernization of its facility and installed a permanently enclosed, electric, soundproof drilling and workover rig that allows for uninterrupted drilling and workover operations despite its close proximity to residential neighborhoods. Production from the West Pico Unit comes from sandstone reservoirs ranging in depths between 4,000 and 7,000 feet below the surface. Oil recovery is enhanced by waterflood injection. The producing wells in the West Pico Unit are all artificially lifted with hydraulic rod pumps and electric submersible pumps. There are currently 36 producing wells and 4 waterflood injection wells in the West Pico Unit. PCEC has the right to drill up to 10 additional wells in the West Pico Unit. West Pico also includes three wells held by the Stocker JV, a joint venture between PCEC and Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC (\u201cSentinel Peak\u201d). The wells were previously owned and operated by Freeport McMoRan Oil & Gas, Inc., which sold and assigned the wells, including all contractual obligations under the joint venture, to Sentinel Peak in a transaction that closed in January 2017. Sentinel Peak operates these three wells that were drilled from its facility to three lease line locations between Sentinel Peak\u2019s and PCEC\u2019s production units.

WPC has advised the Trustee that the majority of the coal seam gas from the Farmout Properties is sold by BP under short-term marketing arrangements at spot market prices and the remainder is marketed by the other operators of the wells in the Farmout Properties. Neither the Gas Purchase Contract nor the Gas Gathering Contract covers the volumes produced from the Farmout Properties. Reserve Report The following table summarizes net proved reserves estimated as of December 31, 2008, and certain related information for the Royalty Interests and Underlying Properties from the December 31, 2008 Reserve Report prepared by Miller and Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers. A summary of the December 31, 2008 Reserve Report is filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference. See Note 9 to \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Financial Statements\u201d for additional information regarding the net proved reserves of the Trust. A net profits interest does not entitle the Trust to a specific quantity of gas but to a portion of the net proceeds derived therefrom. Ordinarily, and in the case of the Farmout Properties, proved reserves attributable to a net profits interest are calculated by deducting an amount of gas sufficient, if sold at the prices used in preparing the reserve estimates for such net profits interest, to pay the future estimated costs and expenses deducted in the calculation of the net proceeds of such interest. Because WPC has agreed to pay certain operating and capital costs with respect to the WI Properties, no amount of gas in respect of such costs has been deducted from the amount of reserves attributable to the WI Properties in determining the amount of reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests."

Foreign Investments\nThe Company's foreign investments involve risks typically associated with investments in emerging markets such as uncertain political, economic, legal and tax environments and expropriation and nationalization of assets. The Company attempts to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where it operates, but there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in protecting against such risks. The Company's international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In addition, if a dispute arises with foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the United States. The Company's private ownership of oil and gas reserves under oil and gas leases in the United States differs distinctly from its ownership of foreign oil and gas properties. In the foreign countries in which the Company does business, the state generally retains ownership of the minerals and consequently retains control of (and in many cases, participates in) the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the United\nNUEVO ENERGY COMPANY --------------------\nStates, and estimates of reserves attributable to properties located outside the United States, may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges."

In the initial discovery well, the latter sand was tight with minimal shows while both the Alice and Bierstadt had excellent gas shows in well developed sands but were extremely close to gas-water contacts. Only the Bierstadt interval could be completed as a water free natural gas discovery well and has been flowing for several months at about 300,000 cubic feet per day. Based on 3-D seismic conducted by another company which became available in exchange for permission to shoot across these leaseholds, it appeared that at least one or more well sites could be selected that could be 20 to 30 feet structurally higher than the Bernsen #1 discovery well at the Vicksburg level and an interesting deeper structure appears prospective for a test well for horizons in the Yegua and below. The Company owns a 62% working interest (48% NRI) in this discovery well and the prospect area. Recently, the Company drilled the Bernsen #2 location using that 3-D seismic data for the well site location and found the Bierstadt and Alice zones about 16 feet and 24 feet higher structurally, respectively. For reasons not entirely clear, the logs showed gas-water contacts to have moved up also with the structural improvement although wireline formation tests of both zones showed them to be gas productive. Since 4 1/2 inch casing was run in the well, only the Bierstadt has been completed as a single zone gas producer in case water has to be handled along with the gas. After perforating the zone, the well instantaneously began flowing at the rate of approximately 200,000 cubic feet per day through a small 6/64th inch choke with 1300 psi flowing tubing pressure and no formation water."

    "documentation": [
      "The combination of faults, fractures, folds and favorable host rocks found in the District has created suitable conditions for lead-zinc-silver mineralization. The geology of the District may display little or no indication of mineralization on the surface, and many of the successful silver mines in the District did not realize their full potential and best grade of ore until after a depth of at least 1700 feet was reached in the development and exploration. Examples include\nthe Galena, Sunshine and Lucky Friday Mines thus, mining claims in the District, often require deep drilling from the surface or underground drilling to determine whether commercial grade ore bodies are present. Exploration of land near major mines is often easier to target for exploration and development from existing shafts. In other silver producing areas, a deposit may bottom out at a few thousand feet below surface. However, in the Coeur d\u2019Alene District, this is not the case, as deep extensions of primarily silver mineralization are faulted and folded, which may have moved the favorable host rocks deeper. Sunshine Property\nBackground\nThe Sunshine Mine was a significant primary silver mine from 1884 to 2001. The mine facility includes extensive underground workings including shafts, levels, raises and ramp systems extending to depths of 6,000 feet below ground and a broad database reflecting over 100 years of exploration, development and production. The mine ceased production in the first quarter of 2001 as a result of several factors, including the low price of silver and the lack of regular and consistent exploration and development activities. Sterling Mining Company acquired control of the Sunshine Mine in June 2003 through a lease with option to purchase agreement. Beginning in August 2003, and followed by the initial drilling in the fall of 2004, Sterling is continuing and expanding an exploration program. The process of rehabilitation of the underground areas of the mine began in late 2004, and the Company is methodically working towards returning the Sunshine Mine to long-term sustained production with a business model that incorporates determining reserves not only in traditional target areas, but also in a new \u201cupper country\u201d target zones."

The Rio Mojos properties (obtained subsequent to December 31, 2005) are discussed in paragraph (j) below. (a) The Cangalli claims\nIn October 1995, we began reviewing potential mining opportunities in Bolivia. Thereafter, we conducted a site visit to the Tipuani Gold Mining District, which is approximately 62 miles north of the Bolivian capital of La Paz. Our representatives traveled to the town of Cangalli, approximately two kilometers down river from the town of Tipuani, a well-known gold mining center in Bolivia. We hired an independent geologist to evaluate the Cangalli area. This geologist reported that the area merited further study and was highly prospective for sizeable gold deposits. (a)(1) Contract for exploration and mining on the Cangalli properties\nBased on this favorable report, along with other pre-existing reports on the Tipuani/Cangalli area, in January 1996, through one of our now-inactive subsidiaries, we entered into an agreement with United Cangalli Gold Mining Cooperative, Ltd. (\u201cUnited Gold Mining Cooperative\u201d), a Bolivian cooperative consisting of 118 members. We operated under this contract from the date of its signing through July 2, 2002. (a)(2) Purchase of the Cangalli properties from the United Gold Mining Cooperative\nOn July 2, 2002, we purchased 100% of all right, title and interest in and to the mining concessions comprising the Cangalli claims. In total, we purchased 5,125 acres. This purchase completely freed our Cangalli properties from any royalty whatsoever. We paid $300,000 in cash, 3,944,500 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share, and assumed $175,000 of United Gold Mining Cooperative\u2019s existing debt payable by us over the course of 4 years."

      "Commencing in 1992, FERC issued Orders Nos. 636, 636-A, 636-B and 636-C (collectively, \"Order No. 636\"), which generally opened access to interstate gas pipelines by requiring such pipelines to \"unbundle\" their transportation services and allow shippers to choose and pay for only the services they require, regardless of whether the shipper purchases gas from such pipelines or from other suppliers. These orders also require upstream pipelines to permit downstream pipelines to assign upstream capacity to their shippers and place analogous, unbundled access requirements on the downstream pipelines. Through individual pipeline restructuring proceedings, Order No. 636 has been implemented on all U.S. interstate pipelines. There are currently a number of judicial challenges to these individual proceedings, which are now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the \"D.C. Circuit\"). In July 1996, the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the terms of the Order No. 636 rulemaking. Certain aspects of the D.C. Circuit's ruling have been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although Order No. 636 does not regulate the Trust, FERC has stated that Order No. 636 is intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. In many instances, the result of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. It is unclear what impact, if any, increased competition within the natural gas industry under Order No. 636 will have on the Trust. The FERC has recently announced its intention to reexamine certain of its transportation-related policies, including the appropriate manner for setting rates for new interstate pipeline construction, the manner in which\ninterstate pipeline shippers may release interstate pipeline capacity under Order No. 636 for resale in the secondary market, and the use of market-based rates for interstate gas transmission."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "As mentioned previously, the entombment of the precious metals in the organic carbon and clays at the Columbus Project can cause problems of detection by many methods of analysis. In January 2010, the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) reported they found no economically significant amounts of gold and silver in five surface samples from the Columbus Salt Marsh using a variety of assay methods. These results are consistent with the values initially found by our independent consultants using similar methods. However, further research and testing led to the development of a caustic fusion protocol, a thiosulphate leach process and, more recently, a gravity concentrating circuit that has extracted economically significant values of gold and silver as \u201cmetal-in-hand,\u201d from samples where conventional fire assay, aqua regia leach and cyanide leach of head ore extracted very low values. The best assay of any geological sample is by quantifying the extracted metal. That is why we and our consultants rely only on extracted gold and silver as \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d for reporting assay results. The caustic fusion and thiosulphate leach provide \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d on head ore as do caustic fusion, thiosulphate leach and cyanide leach on gravity concentrates. Using these assay methods, together with the quality assurances and quality controls of the drill program, we and our consultants are confident of the results that we have reported from head ore and concentrate samples. MINING AND RECOVERY METHODOLOGY\nThe Company currently has a production permit for the Columbus Project. The production permit allows for the extraction of precious metals and the production of calcium carbonate on the 378 acre site (320 acre mine site and 58-acre mill site) at a mine rate of up to 792,000 tons per year. During the period from 2008-2011 the Company developed a dredge mine, constructed a pilot plant and began operations to develop and prove the extractive metallurgy for the Columbus Project. Initial metallurgical testing was primarily focused on extracting gold and silver from the clay material."

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional performance data. These reserve revisions result primarily from increases or decreases in performance due to a variety of factors such as an addition to or a reduction in recoveries below or above previously established, lowest, known hydrocarbon levels, improvements or deteriorations in drainage from natural drive mechanisms, and increases or decreases to drainage areas. If the estimates of proved reserves were to decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense would increase. Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2012, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 20.4 Bcf of natural gas. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are located in Poland, and all are associated with wells that have been drilled, tested, and completed for production. These reserves are classified as proved undeveloped because relatively major expenditures are required for the completion of production facilities, which includes the construction of pipelines to connect the wells to the existing pipeline in order to fully develop the reserves and commence production. We do not have any proved undeveloped reserves attributable to undrilled locations, so the development of such undeveloped reserves is not dependent on additional drilling on undrilled acreage. All development activities will be completed within five years of reserve bookings. Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nNo reserves were converted from undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2011, to developed reserves at December 31, 2012. Development Costs\nCosts incurred relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $2.3 million in 2012, almost all of which were attributable to the construction of production facilities at our Winna Gora and Lisewo wells. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves are projected to be approximately $13.0 million in 2013."

    "documentation": [
      "Between 1970 and 1990, various consortia conducted various exploration activities. Viti Copper Ltd. managed the project during the prefeasibility stage. Over 164,000 feet of drilling was completed and feasibility studies indicated material grading 0.43% copper for the two main Waisoi deposits. From 1986 to 1989, Anglo Pacific Namosi Ltd. and Western Mining Corporation carried out exploration programs aimed at assessing the gold potential at the major prospects and in the vein systems peripheral to the porphyry copper deposits. In 1991, renewed investigations were begun by Placer and included 39 drill holes at Waisoi and 8 holes at Wainabama. Placer conducted a detailed economic study of the Waisoi deposit and concluded that the project required further geological exploration success to achieve viability. In 1998, Royal Oak drilled one hole to a depth of 180 meters on the Wainabama deposit. Sampling, prospecting and mapping were also carried out in the Waivaka Corridor. The Company undertook a 1,000-sample hydrocarbon soil gas\nsurvey covering the northern third of the island of Viti Levu to find a potential source of power that is critical to the development of the Namosi project. The survey resulted in the discovery of seven anomalies. GEOLOGY\nThe major porphyry copper prospects are at Waisoi, Wainabama, Waivaka Corridor and Wainadoi, and there are a number of polymetallic vein and skarn systems around the periphery. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with high level intrusion of Wainamala tuffs and Namosi andesites. The main controls on porphyry intrusions are northeast and north northwest trending faults related to regional tectonics. High copper and gold values occur in the cupola region of the stocks and around brecciated, faulted and stockworked haloes. ORE RESERVES The Company has not included any portion of the Namosi property in mineable (proven and probable) reserves. The most significant part of the Namosi property is the Waisoi deposit. As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the mineral inventory on the Waisoi deposit to be approximately 9.1 billion pounds of copper and 4.0 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 1.0 billion tons at a grade of 0.430% copper and 0.004 opt of gold."

      "AEP is reevaluating its air releases and will provide supplemental information as appropriate. Global Climate Change: In December 1997, delegates from 167 nations, including the United States, agreed to a treaty, known as the \"Kyoto Protocol,\" establishing legally-binding emission reductions for gases suspected of causing climate change. If the U.S. becomes a party to the treaty it will be bound to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane and nitrous oxides by 7% below 1990 levels and emissions of hydrofluorcarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride 7% below 1995 levels in the years 2008-2012. The Protocol was available for signature from March 16, 1998 to March 15, 1999 and requires ratification by at least 55 nations that account for at least 55% of developed countries' 1990 emissions of CO(2) to enter into force. Although the United States has agreed to the treaty and signed it on November 12, 1998, President Clinton has indicated that he will not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it contains requirements for \"meaningful participation by key developing countries\" and the rules, procedures, methodology and guidelines of the treaty's market-based policy instruments, joint implementation programs and compliance enforcement provisions have been negotiated. At the Fourth Conference of the Parties, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, the parties agreed to a work plan to complete negotiations on outstanding issues with a view toward approving them at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to be held in November 2000. Since the AEP System is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by the imposition of limitations on CO(2) emissions if compliance costs cannot be fully recovered from customers. In addition, any such severe program to reduce CO(2) emissions could impose substantial costs on industry and society and erode the economic base that AEP's operations serve."

      "Sabine Corporation did not warrant title to the Royalty Properties either expressly or by implication. Reserves\nThe Registrant has obtained from DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineering consultants, a study of the proved oil and gas reserves attributable as of January 1, 2021 to the Royalty Properties. The following letter report summarizes such reserve study and sets forth information as to the assumptions, qualifications, procedures and other matters relating to such reserve study. Because the only assets of the Trust are the Royalty Properties, the Trustee believes the reserve study provides useful information for Unit holders. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production. The reserve data set forth herein, although prepared by independent petroleum engineers in a manner customary in the industry, are estimates only, and actual quantities and values of oil and gas are likely to differ from the estimated amounts set forth herein. In addition, the reserve estimates for the Royalty Properties will be affected by future changes in sales prices for oil and gas produced. See Note 8 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 hereof for additional unaudited information regarding the proved oil and gas reserves of the Trust. Other than those filed with the SEC, our estimated reserves have not been filed with or included in any reports to any federal agency. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment. As a result, the Trustee has developed internal policies and controls for estimating reserves attributable to the Trust. As described above, the Trust does not have information that would be available to a company with oil and gas operations because detailed information is not generally available to owners of royalty interests. The Trustee gathers production information (which information is net to the Trust\u2019s interests in the Royalty Properties) and provides such information to DeGolyer and MacNaughton, who extrapolates from such information estimates of the reserves attributable to the Royalty Properties based on its expertise in the oil and gas fields where the Royalty Properties are situated, as well as publicly available information."

      "Item 2 and Note 4 to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Impact of Year 2000 - ------------------- The General Partner and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, the General Partner's ultimate parent (together, John Hancock) along with the Partnership, have developed a plan to modify or replace significant portions of the Partnership's computer information and automated technologies so that its systems will function properly with respect to the dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. The Partnership presently believes that with modifications to existing systems and conversions to new technologies, the year 2000 will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems. However, if certain modifications and conversions are not made, or are not completed timely, the year 2000 issue could have an adverse impact on the operations of the Partnership. John Hancock as early as 1994 had begun assessing, modifying and converting the software related to its significant systems and has initiated formal communications with its significant business partners and customers to determine the extent to which John Hancock's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues. While John Hancock is developing alternative third party processing arrangements as it deems appropriate, there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Partnership's systems rely will be converted timely or will not have an adverse effect on the Partnership's systems. The Partnership expects the project to be substantially complete by early 1999. This completion target was derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, including availability of certain resources and other factors. However, there can be no guarantee that this completion target will be achieved.

      "During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, the average net daily production was 7,702 Bbls of oil and 4,832 Mcf of natural gas, or 8,514 Boe per day from the Rocky Mountain properties. The Company's leasehold interests include 164,598 net developed and 237,133 net undeveloped acres, which represent 30% and 42% of the Company's total leasehold, respectively. This leasehold is expected to be developed utilizing 3-D seismic, precision horizontal drilling and secondary recovery technologies, where applicable. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's Rocky Mountain properties included an inventory of 93 development and 17 exploratory drilling locations. WILLISTON BASIN\nCEDAR HILLS FIELD. The Cedar Hills Field was discovered in November 1994. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, the Cedar Hills Field properties produced 2,943 net Boe per day to the Company interests and represented 49% of the PV-10 attributable to the Company's estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001. The Cedar Hills Field produces oil from the Red River \"B\" formation, a thin (eight feet), non-fractured, blanket-type, dolomite reservoir found at depths of 8,000 to 9,500 feet. All wells drilled by the Company in the Red River \"B\" formation were drilled exclusively with precision horizontal drilling technology. The Cedar Hills Field covers approximately 200 square miles and has a known oil column of 1,000 feet. Through December 31, 2001, the Company drilled or participated in 167 gross (117 net) horizontal wells, of which 160 were successfully completed, for a 96% net success rate. The Company believes that the Red River \"B\" formation in the Cedar Hills Field is well suited for enhanced secondary recovery using either HPAI and/or traditional water flooding technology. Both technologies have been applied successfully in adjacent secondary recovery units for over 30 years and have proven to increase oil recoveries from the Red River \"B\" formation by 200% to 300% over primary recovery. The Company is proficient using either technology and is in the process of implementing both as part of its secondary recovery operations in the Cedar Hills Field."

Air is the only practical way to the property either by float plane, ski plane in the winter, or helicopter. Ground travel is unsafe and impractical in the summer due to the dense population of black bears, grizzly bears, bogs and small lakes. Winter access by snow machine could be possible, although difficult.

We estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and recognize expense for only those shares expected to vest. We have estimated our forfeiture rate based on our historical experience with stock-based awards that are granted and forfeited prior to vesting. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could also differ from what we have recorded in the current period. As required under ASC 718, we will review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, may periodically change the valuation assumptions used to value employee stock-based awards granted in future periods. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011.

      "The stratigraphically lowest rocks within the Red Dog plate belong to the Kayak Shale. The top of the Kayak Shale is interbedded with rocks of the Kuna Formation. The Ikalukrok Unit has been divided into a lower laminated black shale sub-unit and an upper medium- to thick-bedded black chert sub-unit. The Ikalukrok Unit hosts all of the massive sulfide deposits in the area. Locally, the Lik property is hosted in the upper part of the Ikalukrok Unit of the Kuna Formation. The host rocks are carbonaceous and siliceous black shale, with subordinate black chert and fine-grained limestone. These rocks strike broadly north-south and dip at about 25o to 40o to the west. The massive sulfides are overlain conformably by rocks of the Siksikpuk Formation. The sequence is overridden by allochthonous rocks that form high hills north and west of the deposits. The mineralized sequence is cut by a number of faults. The most significant disruption is the Main Break Fault, which drops the northern end of the Lik deposit down about 500 feet. It is unclear whether there is a change in strike north of the fault, or whether the change is more apparent due to topography. The Main Break Fault strikes east-west and dips north at about 60o. There is another group of steeper faults that tend to strike northerly or northwesterly and which are interpreted as being both normal and reverse with throws of up to 330 feet. The drilling in 2008 appears to demonstrate that several of these faults are non-existent or more minor than previously interpreted. 6. Prior Exploration\nThe Red Dog ore deposit was originally discovered in 1970 by a geologist undertaking mapping in the De Long Mountains area on behalf of the United States Geological Survey. GCO carried out stream geochemical sampling and reconnaissance for color anomalies. Claims were staked in July 1976 to cover a stream geochemical anomaly on Lik Creek. The Lik property was drill tested in the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s and sporadically through the early 1990s.

A detailed geologic model was produced based on the results of the 2011 exploration work, and subsequent supporting geophysical surveys were completed in March, 2012. On February 5, 2013, Calico exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Grassy Mountain Project from Seabridge. A mineralized material estimate was prepared by Hardrock Consulting Inc. in November, 2014. An independent preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) was prepared in February, 2015 by MMC, which verified the mineralized material estimate and included all drill data obtained as of September 26, 2014. The PEA concluded that potential exists for the discovery of additional mineralized material at exploration target areas identified within the Grassy Mountain claim block and the current mineralized material at Grassy Mountain is sufficient to warrant continued planning and effort to explore, permit, and develop the Grassy Mountain Project. There is sufficient data to support a basic geologic model and continuing development of the project and the detailed geologic model described in the PEA, along with the results of the exploration, drilling, and geophysical surveys completed as of October 2014, are sufficient to support preparation of a Preliminary Feasibility Study."

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Geological Setting\nRegional Geology\nThe Goliad Project area is situated in the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province that is geologically characterized by sedimentary deposits that typically dip and thicken toward the Gulf of Mexico from the northwest source areas. Additionally, the regional dip generally increases with distance in the down dip direction as the overall thickness of sediments increase. The sedimentary units are dominantly continental clastic deposits with some near shore and shallow marine facies. The uranium-bearing units are virtually all sands and sandstones in Tertiary formations ranging in age from Eocene (oldest) to Upper Miocene (youngest). Local and Property Geology The surface of the property is all within the outcrop area of the Goliad Formation (Figure 4-3). The mineralized units are sands and sandstone within the Goliad Formation and are designated by us as the A through D sands from younger (upper) to older (lower), respectively. The sand units are generally fine to medium grained sands with silt and varying amounts of secondary calcite. The sand units vary in color depending upon the degree of oxidation-reduction and could be from light brown-tan to grays. The sands units are generally separated from each other by silty clay or clayey silts that serve as confining units between the sand units. The Goliad Formation at the Project site occurs from the surface to a depth of about 500 feet. Depending upon the land surface elevation, groundwater occurs in the sands of the formation below depths of about 30 to 60 feet. The four sand/sandstone zones (A-D) designated as containing uranium mineralization at the site are all considered to be a part of the Gulf Coast Aquifer on a regional basis. At the project area, however, each zone is a hydrogeologic unit with similar but variable characteristics. The A Zone is the uppermost unit and based on resistance logs groundwater in this unit may be unconfined over portions of the site. The three deeper zones are confined units with confining clays and silts above and below the water-bearing unit."

Mineral production, if any, from the Property is subject to a 2% royalty payable to the Buhrmans based upon gross revenues less deductions as defined by the Buhrman Agreement. SRC has the exclusive right and option to purchase such royalty at any time for the sum of $1,000,000 less any payments previously made by SRC to the Buhrmans pursuant to such royalty. In the past the Federal government permitted private parties to obtain title to a claim known as a \u201cpatented claim\u201d if certain conditions were met. A patented mining claim arises where the Federal Government passes its title to the claimant, making it private land. A mineral patent gives the owner exclusive title to the mineral interests and title to the surface and other resources. Patents for claims are no longer issued. Unpatented lode mineral claims are created by physically inserting a stake in the ground at each corner of the claim and filing the location of the claim as so demarcated with a government BLM recording office. The rights associated with an unpatented claim are restricted to the extraction and development of mineral deposits. No land ownership is conveyed with an unpatented claim.

      "History: The Longstreet Property was discovered in the early 1900\u2019s, but had limited development work until 1929. A 1929 report and maps show development of the \u201cGolden Lion Mine\u201d on two levels spaced 75 meters apart vertically. The report indicates development of 300,000 tons of \u201cvein material\u201d averaging 0.20 oz/ton (6.8 g/t) gold and 8 oz/ton (274 g/t) silver. A mill was constructed, the remnants of which are still on the property. However, the small stopes underground indicate very little mining was done and the operation was abandoned. The property lay idle until 1980 when Keradamex Inc. and E & B Exploration formed a joint venture to explore the property. The venture conducted soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, limited underground sampling and drilled seven (one was abandoned) angle core holes into the Main mine workings area. This drilling revealed the presence of fracture related gold mineralization up to 36 meters thick extending into the hanging wall of the vein structure. Gold mineralization within this zone averaged 0.02- 0.528 oz/ton (0.7-18.1 g/t) and revealed the presence of a heap leachable target. In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing. In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing. In early 1984 Naneco Resources Ltd., an Alberta company, acquired all of the assets of Minerva and an additional 10 percent interest in the property from Geomex. As operator, Naneco immediately initiated drilling. In 1985, with over 200 RC holes drilled the venture announced its drilling samples averaged 0.079 oz/ton (2.7 g/t) gold and 1.1 oz/ton (38 g/t) silver on the high end grade along\nPage 12 of 50\nwith an additional low grade average of 0.021 oz/ton (0.72 g/t) gold and 0.4 oz/ton (14 g/t) silver."

    "documentation": [
      "The Company has historically expended a significant amount of funds on consulting, geochemical analytical testing, metallurgical processing and extracting, and precious metal assaying of material, however, the Company does not consider those activities as research and development activities. All those expenses are borne by the Company. Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Liability Act (\u201cSuperfund\u201d) affect mineral operations. For exploration and mining operations, applicable environmental regulation includes a permitting process for mining operations, an abandoned mine reclamation program and a permitting program for industrial development. Other nonenvironmental regulations can impact exploration and mining operations and indirectly affect compliance with environmental regulations. For example, a state highway department may have to approve a new access road to make a project accessible at lower costs, but the new road itself may raise environmental issues. Compliance with these laws, and any regulations adopted there under, can make the development of mining claims prohibitively expensive, thereby frustrating the sale or lease of properties, or curtailing profits or royalties which might have been received there from. The Company presently has no full-time employees and relies on outside subcontractors, consultants and agents, to perform various administrative, legal and technical functions, as required.

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The Gossan Ridge Target consists of a series of banded quartz-sulfide veins associated with a dike-sill swarm that runs along the crest and flanks of rust-colored ridgeline exhibiting heavily iron oxide-staining reflecting weathering and oxidation of widespread disseminated sulfides in the rocks exposed along the ridge. The vein system has an exposed strike length of over 1600 feet and exposed widths up to 150 feet and the alteration zone and lower grade old mineralization is up to 350 feet wide and 4900 feet long with up to 650 feet of exposed vertical extent. Samples from the vein system consistently carry highly anomalous gold and pathfinder elements with select samples running up to 10 parts per million (0.29 ounces per ton) gold and 200 parts per million (5.8 ounces per ton) silver. The vein system appears to be associated with a series of porphyritic dikes that have produced pervasive and intense hydrothermal alteration of the host sedimentary rocks. The dikes and sills typically contain lower grade gold mineralization, but their widespread presence and intense alteration associated with the igneous rocks throughout the complex suggest the presence of a larger, potentially mineralized igneous body at depth. During 2007, additional rock and soil sampling was completed and the previously outlined soil anomaly was extended to more than 1 kilometer along strike. Over 51 line-miles of ground magnetics were completed and located a distinctive circular magnetic anomaly adjacent to, and overlapping with the main soil and rock chip anomaly. The magnetic feature extends beneath a glacial drift-filled valley and underlies another prominent alteration zone on the adjacent ridge slopes. Prospecting this feature in 2007 confirmed the presence of quartz-arsenopyrite-stibnite veins and fracture-controlled sulfides potentially indicative of cupola-related mineralization above a buried intrusion. A single 3-mile long, induced polarization and resistivity survey line was run adjacent to the main showing and generated a good IP response over the circular ground magnetics feature."

In March 2010, notice of termination of each of the Chevron, BP Energy Company and Macquarie Cook Energy LLC contracts was given such that they terminated effective March 31, 2011. Requests for proposal were circulated to potential purchasers of those packages of gas covered by the expiring contracts with a view toward obtaining new contracts to be effective April 1, 2011. Neither BROG, PG&E, nor NMGC gave notice of termination of their contracts such that the terms of those two contracts were automatically extended through at least March 31, 2013. BROG entered into three new contracts effective April 1, 2011, for the sale of the gas produced from the Underlying Properties but not sold under the two pre-existing contracts. The purchasers under such new contracts are Chevron, PG&E and Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (\u201cSRP\u201d). All five of the current contracts provided for (i) the delivery of such gas at various delivery points through March 31, 2013 and from year-to-year thereafter, until terminated by either party on written notice (except for the SRP contract which terminates March 31, 2012); and (ii) the sale of such gas at prices which fluctuate in accordance with the published indices for gas sold in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. Requests for proposals have been circulated with a view toward entering into a new contract expiring March 31, 2013 for the sale of those volumes currently sold under contracts set to expire March 31, 2012. On or about January 4, 2012 the operator of the Lybrook gas processing plant took that facility out of service and rerouted gas formerly treated there to its Ignacio plant. Because the NMGC system is not interconnected with the Ignacio plant it became impossible for BROG to sell gas to NMGC under the contract described above such that BROG declared a force majeure event and terminated the NMGC contract."

      "Presently, the Company is seeking funding to purchase equipment, to purchase inventory, and to use for working capital for its on-site proposed open-pit, heap-leaching operation. In addition, the Company is planning its strategies for the New SSGM in anticipation of increasing its gold ore reserves. The Company's main objective and plan, through the Joint Venture, is to operate a moderate tonnage, low-grade, open-pit, heap-leaching operation to produce gold on its SSGM site. Dependent on the funding, the grade of ore, and the tonnage processed, it anticipates producing more than 40,000 ounces of gold from its open-pit, heap-leaching operation during the first twelve full operating months and then gradually increasing the annual production of gold to 113,000 ounces. Proposed SSGM Open-Pit, Heap-Leaching Operation The Joint Venture has placed the SCMP into a curbed production operation. It now intends to obtain a sum of $8 million or more to commence an open-pit, heap-leaching operation at the SSGM site. An additional $8 million or more is estimated to be required for the crushing system, plant, and mining equipment, if the Joint Venture were unable to lease this equipment. After these funds are obtained, the Joint Venture intends to start processing gold ore from its open pit at a production level of 2,000 tons per day. During the second year, the production level plans are to expand production to 3,000 tons per day (the funds for this expansion could be generated from profits). An increase to process 4,000 tons of gold ore per day would take place during the third year and another expansion to process 6,000 tons per day would take place at the beginning of the fifth year; all funds for this expansion should be available through a combination of earned profits, borrowings, equity sales, or other creative sources. With the anticipated production volume, there is more than a nine-year supply of gold ore as it is believed that a substantial amount of gold ore can be proven. The Company's geologists have defined a body of ore consisting of 138 million tons of gold ore at a grade of 0.025 ounces of gold per ton."

      "At this time we do not consider these additional claims to be material to our current operating plan. Project Location and Access\nThe Gold Hill Mining District is located in the Gold Hill and the Clifton 7\u00bd minute quadrangles in western Utah. The district includes the north end of the Deep Creek Mountains, one of the nearly north-south ranges that are common in the Great Basin. On the east and north, the mountain area is separated by gravel slopes from the flat plain of the Great Salt Lake Desert, and on the west it is bounded by the Deep Creek Valley and groups of irregular low hills. It is approximately 190 miles west-southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, and approximately 56 miles south southeast of Wendover, Utah. The project is reached by taking Alternate 93A south from Wendover approximately 28 miles and turning east on to the Ibapah Highway, a paved two lane road. Approximately 17 miles east is a maintained two lane county road which provides access to the property approximately 11 miles southeast to the town of Gold Hill, Utah. Each of the claims and the mill site are accessible by dirt roads maintained year-round by us and Tooele County. Access to the property is maintained all year and we likewise intend to maintain roadways between the mining claims, the mill site and paved roads all year. Mineral extraction activities on the property at this time will be open-pit with heap leach processing. We anticipate conducting underground exploration in the future. History\nThe Gold Hill area is one of the oldest mining districts in the State of Utah. It reflects 43 known historical producing deposits mined primarily from the mid-1800s until the end of World War II. These deposits included gold, silver, copper, bismuth, lead, zinc, tungsten, arsenic, molybdenum, cobalt, and beryllium. Exploration and mining activities commenced in the mid-1800s as travel westward through the area to California was at its peak. Lead mineralization first attracted the attention of travelers prompting early prospecting."

Revett Silver holds Troy through its wholly-owned subsidiary Troy Mine Inc. and it holds Rock Creek through its wholly-owned subsidiary RC Resources Inc. Both properties are located in northwestern Montana\nGeological Setting. The geology of the region is characterized by a thick sedimentary sequence Proterozoic in age. Within this sequence, there are four major conformable groups: Lower Belt, Ravalli, Middle Belt Carbonate and Missoula Groups. The Troy and Rock Creek deposits are found within the Ravalli Group, specifically in the Revett Formation. These formations represent a mature, clastic sandstone of varying thicknesses with the sulphide mineralization being stratabound and disseminated. Copper and silver mineralization occurs within favorable beds throughout the Revett Formation (in excess of 2,000 feet thick) as depicted in the following diagram. Stratabound Copper-Silver Deposits. Base and precious metals mineralization is associated with sulphide dissemination occurring within selected portions of the Precambrian Belt Supergroup, and more specifically within the Revett Formation. This type of mineralization, referred to as stratabound disseminated copper deposits, is interpreted to result from the migration of hydrothermal solutions through unconsolidated porous sediments prior to, or during, diagenesis. This class of copper and silver deposits has received considerable research to understand their genesis and determine the fundamental controls on ore distribution. All deposits are very similar and exhibit consistent lateral metal and mineral zoning which were interpreted to derive from primary ore-forming processes. Copper-Silver Mineralization. Copper is found in the sulphide minerals bornite and chalcocite and most often occurs as fine-grained disseminations with concentration of these minerals (less than two percent up to approximately six percent) along fractures, veinlets and bedding planes."

      "Percentage rent accounted for less than 2% of total shopping center revenues in 2001. None of the tenants in the Retail Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenues. Below is a listing of tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Retail property revenues in 2001: In February 2001, Bradlees, which was in Chapter 11, closed all of its stores including the 16 locations it leased from the Company. Three of the former Bradlees leases were assigned and 13 were rejected. Of the 16 locations, the leases for 13 are fully guaranteed (6 of these guarantees expire in 2002) and one is guaranteed as to 70% by Stop & Shop, under a Master Agreement and Guaranty dated May 1, 1992. Stop & Shop is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KoninKlijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), a leading international food retailer. In addition, Stop & Shop also guarantees four other leases which were rejected in a prior Bradlees bankruptcy (three of which have been assigned). The effectiveness of Stop & Shop's guarantee is not affected by Bradlees' bankruptcy or subsequent lease assignments. Annual property rentals at December 31, 2001, include an aggregate of $4,000,000 of additional rent allocated to the former Bradlees locations in East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge in accordance with the Master Agreement and Guaranty. This rent will be reallocated to other locations guaranteed by Stop & Shop at or prior to the applicable expiration dates of such leases. The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2001 lease expirations for each of the next 10 years assuming that none of the tenants exercise their renewal options. In 2001, approximately 417,000 square feet of retail space was leased at a weighted average base rent per square foot of $16.54, a 21.8% increase over the weighted average escalated rent per square foot of $13.58 for the expiring leases. Following is the detail by property:\n---------- (1) Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in the initial rent per square foot leased."

      "The estimated cost of the mine and mill is approximately $80 million. Mineral Reserves\nThe reserves reported in a Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 report in August 2006 of 448,800 ounces of gold and the resources were based upon the 2003 to 2006 exploration program and included a pre-feasibility study of developing an open pit mine on the Black Fox property. This study did not consider any underground material. We report no reserves at Black Fox under SEC Industry Guide 7, which requires a final bankable feasibility study. The new resource study was prepared by MDA. MDA has confirmed that the resource study complies in all respects with NI 43-101 guidelines. The table below summarizes the Black Fox Total Mineral Resource:\nBlack Fox Total Mineral Resource Summary\nMDA completed the resource estimate of material contained in the Black Fox model between the 9300 elevation and the 9960 elevation. Most of the resource is contained in a part of the Destor-Porcupine Fault, 750 meters along strike and drilled to a depth of 350 meters on the west and 500 meters on the east. The mineralization remains open along strike and to depth. The Black Fox resource estimate is based on two cut offs. A 0.90 g Au/t cut off, suitable for the open pit, was applied to material down to the 9720 elevation, or about 280 meters below the surface. Below the 9720 elevation, a 3.0 g Au/t cut off was used since it is likely that this material would only be mined by underground methods. Open Pit Reserves\nThe open pit reserves of 448,800 gold ounces are in a pre-feasibility study completed by MDA. The study indicates an economic project based on a gold price of $550 per ounce. Pit optimization studies were completed utilizing the following parameters for the deposit:\n\u00b7\nOverburden mining costs - $1.25 per tonne of material;\n\u00b7\nRock mining costs - $1.50 per tonne of material;\n\u00b7\nProcessing costs - $12.16 per tonne ore;\n\u00b7\nGeneral administration costs - $4.50 per tonne ore;\n\u00b7\nPlant gold recovery - 96%; and\n\u00b7\nAssume 50% of existing underground workings backfilled with material having a density of 2.0."

      "We conduct most of our mining operations on properties that we lease from states or the federal government. These leases generally contain stipulations that require us to commence mining operations within a specified term and continue mining to retain the lease. The stipulations on our leases are subject to periodic readjustment by the applicable state government and the federal government. The lease stipulations could change in the future, which could impact the economics of our operations. Our federal leases are for indefinite terms subject to readjustment of the lease stipulations, including the royalty payable to the federal government, every 20 years. Our leases with the State of New Mexico are issued for terms of 10 years and for as long thereafter as potash is produced in commercial quantities and are subject to readjustment of the lease stipulations, including the royalty payable to the state. Our leases with the State of Utah are for terms of 10 years subject to extension and possible readjustment of the lease by the State of Utah. Our leases for our Moab mine are operated as a unit under a unit agreement with the State of Utah, which extends the terms of all of the leases as long as operations are conducted on any portion of the leases. The term of the state leases for our Moab mine is currently extended until 2024 or so long as potash is being produced. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 22% of our state, federal, and private lease acres at our New Mexico facilities will be up for renewal within the next five years, and 43% of our state and federal lease acres at our Utah operations will be up for renewal within the next five years. We have water rights at each of our mine properties that we believe are adequate for our needs. All of our mining operations are accessible by paved state or county highways and are accessible by rail. All of our operations obtain electric power from local utilities. Our mines, plants, and equipment have been in substantially continuous operation since the dates indicated in the chart entitled \"Our Proven and Probable Reserves\" on the following pages (except for our West facility, which is currently in care-and-maintenance mode), and our mineral development assets, mills, and equipment have been acquired over the interval since these dates."

      "This liability is a significant management estimate. Adjustments to the liability are subject to estimation and may change dramatically from period-to-period based on assumptions used for production rates, reserve quantities, commodity pricing, discount rates, production tax rates, and production costs. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $11.4 million to $19.9 million for 2007 compared to $8.5 million for 2006. The increase reflects an increase in our average outstanding borrowings in 2007 compared with 2006. Additionally, the increase reflects that we have $287.5 million of 3.50% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding at December 31, 2007, compared with 100.0 million of 5.75% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2006. We also capitalized $5.4 million of interest in 2007 compared to $3.5 million in 2006. Income tax expense. Income tax expense totaled $110.6 million for 2007 and $105.3 million in 2006, resulting in effective tax rates of 36.8 percent and 35.7 percent, respectively. The effective rate change from 2006 reflects changes in the mix of the highest marginal state tax rates as a result of enacted Texas margin tax legislation, the benefit of federal and state estimated percentage depletion expense, acquisition and drilling activity, and also reflects other permanent differences including differing estimated effects between years of the domestic production activities deduction. The current portion of income tax expense in 2007 is $17.6 million compared to $30.5 million in 2006. These amounts are 16 percent and 29 percent of total income tax expense for the respective periods. The decrease resulted from significant increased drilling activity reflecting the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred, thereby reducing current taxable income. We project that the current portion of taxable income will be similar in 2008. Comparison of Financial Results and Trends between 2006 and 2005\nOil and gas production revenues. Average net daily production increased six percent to a record 254.2 MMCFE for 2006 compared with 239.4 MMCFE in 2005."

Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp. has not yet undertaken any development work at the property. Power and water sources have not yet been formally assessed. Accessibility\nThe property lies in Bear Trap Canyon, a tributary at the head of East Canyon. This is midway between the EFR Rim Mine and the Calliham/Sage mine area. Access to the Dunn project is from West Summit Road (San Juan County Road 313), 10.8 miles north of the junction with U.S. Highway 491. West Summit Road is a two-lane paved road that is well maintained year round. At 10.8 miles, a graveled Class D County Road (unnamed), spurs off of West Summit Road, passes through the leased lands and terminates at the Dunn Portal at approximately 2.1 miles from the spur. The nearest town to the Dunn project is Monticello, Utah which is approximately 65 miles away. The closest commercial airport facilities are located in Cortez, Colorado, approximately 65 miles to the southeast, and Moab, Utah approximately 65 miles to the northwest; both airports have daily commercial flights to-and-from Denver International Airport. History\nThe first discovery of uranium-vanadium mineralization within close proximity to the Dunn project was by Homestake Mining Company in the late 1960s at what would eventually become the Wilson Mine 4 miles to the east."
