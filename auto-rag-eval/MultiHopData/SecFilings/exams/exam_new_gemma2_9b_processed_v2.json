    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "The Ahafo mine operates on three mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Ahafo to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 13 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana. The Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu is progressing towards future laybacks. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and thirty-eight 141-tonne haul trucks. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of five underground loaders and eight haul trucks, each with a 60-tonne payload. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The processing plant was commissioned in 2006 to process 7.5 million tonnes of primary and oxide ore per year. With the depletion of oxide ore, the current plant throughput has decreased to 6.5 million tonnes per year. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, carbon in leach tanks, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit and a tailings disposal facility. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, an ongoing development project, will expand the existing plant by approximately 3.5 million tonnes per year through the installation of a new crusher, a single stage SAG mill and two leach tanks.",
      "Ahafo\u2019s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2018 was $2,218. Ahafo produced 436,000 ounces of gold in 2018 and reported 9.7 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2018. Akyem, Ghana. (100% owned) Akyem is located in Birim North District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 85% of Akyem as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2006, Newmont acquired the remaining 15% from Kenbert Mines Ltd. The Akyem operations are comprised of one mill and one open pit mine, and commenced commercial production in October 2013. The Akyem operations have an area of approximately 15,500 acres (6,000 hectares) for the mining lease concession. The Akyem mine operates on two mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold, including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Akyem to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 6 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Akyem pays a sliding scale royalty to the government based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production. The Company also pays an additional 0.6% for mining in a forest reserve area. The Akyem mine is an orogenic gold deposit that has oxide and primary mineralization. The deposit is localized in the Akyem fault zone and gold mineralization is controlled by a series of brittle fracture zones located within the fault zone. The Akyem mine is an open pit mine consisting of a large main pit and a smaller east pit, connected near the surface. The planned pit covers an area of approximately 345 acres (139 hectares). The available mining fleet consists of two shovels, two excavators and nineteen 136-tonne haul trucks. The daily production rate is approximately 88,000 tonnes."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Four major mining methods were historically employed in the Mine. The oldest is square set or cut and fill. These methods employ support of the stope where the vein is mined with sets of timbers and/or rock bolts, and then sand-fill is pumped from the surface as the mining activity moves to a higher elevation. The broken ore was scraped into chutes by compressed air powered slushers and dropped into ore pockets on the level below. The second method called shrink stoping is similar to the above, but no ground support is required. Instead, the broken ore is used as both ground support and a mining floor and the full mining cut is completed prior to withdrawing the ore from the stope. Air powered slushers or compressed air operated mucking machines on rubber tires were historically used. A third mining method is known as room and pillar mining. In this operation, no timber is required but pillars of ore are left in place as supports until the stoping moves to a higher elevation, at which time sand fill is pumped in to provide the floor for the next cut. As the ore is broken, rubber tired, compressed air operated mucking machines picked it up putting it into a box on the back of the loader. It was then transported to a chute in the stope where it dropped into the ore pocket on a lower level. The fourth method is sublevel blasthole stoping. Diesel powered equipment cuts horizontal slices every forty feet in the ore zones. Then long holes are drilled in the pillars between horizontal slices. The holes are blasted allowing the ore to fall to the bottom slice and scooped up by diesel powered loaders and transported to ore passes. This method was used above the Kellogg Tunnel, and ore was transported by gravity to the tunnel and hauled out by train to the surface. From the ore pockets on the various levels of the mine below the Kellogg Tunnel, ore trains powered by battery driven locomotives transported the ore to ore pockets located at the shaft. In the shaft, large steel buckets, called skips, were loaded and hoisted to the Kellogg Tunnel level where the ore was dumped into two large concrete bins.",

Drawn from these storage areas by gravity, the ore was next transported two miles to the surface in 22-car ore trains pulled by trolley and diesel locomotives. With the exception of the use of square set timbering, all of the above mining methods are likely to be employed in the restart of the Bunker Hill Mine. The main improvement and productivity gain over historic operations will be the widespread use of rubber-tired equipment, which will be used for mucking and transport of the broken mineralized material. The upper part of the mine is largely already developed with ramps, which will be used by the Company for rubber-tired access."

      "Management must adopt this general concept as a wellsite location guideline for most wellbores in this area in future. Heidi Prospect - Jim Wells County, Texas - ----------------------------------------\nThis Vicksburg formation gas prospect near Alice, Texas is fairly shallow at 5,800 feet deep with three potentially productive sand zones which are known locally as the Bierstadt, the Alice and the Stillwell sand in descending order beginning at about 5,100 feet. In the initial discovery well, the latter sand was tight with minimal shows while both the Alice and Bierstadt had excellent gas shows in well developed sands but were extremely close to gas-water contacts. Only the Bierstadt interval could be completed as a water free natural gas discovery well and has been flowing for several months at about 300,000 cubic feet per day. Based on 3-D seismic conducted by another company which became available in exchange for permission to shoot across these leaseholds, it appeared that at least one or more well sites could be selected that could be 20 to 30 feet structurally higher than the Bernsen #1 discovery well at the Vicksburg level and an interesting deeper structure appears prospective for a test well for horizons in the Yegua and below. The Company owns a 62% working interest (48% NRI) in this discovery well and the prospect area. Recently, the Company drilled the Bernsen #2 location using that 3-D seismic data for the well site location and found the Bierstadt and Alice zones about 16 feet and 24 feet higher structurally, respectively. For reasons not entirely clear, the logs showed gas-water contacts to have moved up also with the structural improvement although wireline formation tests of both zones showed them to be gas productive. Since 4 1/2 inch casing was run in the well, only the Bierstadt has been completed as a single zone gas producer in case water has to be handled along with the gas. After perforating the zone, the well instantaneously began flowing at the rate of approximately 200,000 cubic feet per day through a small 6/64th inch choke with 1300 psi flowing tubing pressure and no formation water.",
      "During initial cleanup, the well flowed natural gas through a 11/64th inch choke at the rate of 1,781,000 cubic feet per day along with frac condensate and water at a daily rate of 66 barrels and six barrels respectively. Flowing tubing pressure was 3247 psi. The well will be flowed on a temporary basis at this lower rate pending the construction of a gathering line of larger diameter pipe. It now appears evident that in order for these Luling Sands to be found productive of natural gas and water free, they must be penetrated at the apex of the structure which would place them as much as 150 feet structurally higher than in the present Long #2 wellbore. While it is disappointing not to be able to use this larger diameter casing for a dual completion, this will prove helpful for drilling to the deeper and higher pressured formations in future. We will be able to use large diameter drilling tools and cross the sealing fault at the best possible structural position for either the Mackhank or the Massive Sands of the middle Wilcox. There is also an alternative that a window can be cut and a wellbore drilled directionally to the structural apex of the Luling from this existing cased wellbore at a later date when the Slick reservoir has been depleted. Management has not wavered in its belief that this Prospect Area holds significant potential for rapidly growing the Company's natural gas reserves. However, it has become painfully evident from its experience with the first two wells that further attempts to achieve dual completions in this type of high structural relief environment is neither realistically practical nor truly a money saving approach for rapid extraction of reserves. Each prospective reservoir in every fault block apparently must be drilled at the optimum structural position. Also, a drilling and completion program must be designed which will minimize the damage to the clays contained in these sands. It is extremely frustrating to have to accept producing wellbores in the range of 10 billion cubic feet of reserves instead of multiple sand completions with 25 billion cubic feet of reserves."

We may exercise the option for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the sixteen year primary term of the mineral lease. The option can be kept current by an annual payment of $10,000. The purchase price will be the appraised value of the surface at the time of exercising the option. The ground water lease secures our right to develop the ground water within a 13,120 acre lease area located approximately 4 miles from the Round Top deposit. The lease area contains five existing water wells. It is anticipated that all potential water needs for the Round Top Project mine operations will be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease has an annual minimum production payment of $5,000 prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production we will pay $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect. Existing Infrastructure\nThe Round Top rare earth prospect was initially developed in the late 1980s as a beryllium resource. As a result, several pieces of equipment were present at the property when we acquired the lease, some of which we have repaired as described below. The previous operators had also built out several roads at the prospect site, which we believe are suitable for our current exploration plans. There exists on the Round Top site a 1,115 foot, 10 foot by 10 foot decline from the surface into the Round Top prospect. There are steel sets every five feet, in some cases less, and the entire working is lagged with timber. There are \u201cescape holes\u201d at intervals to allow personnel to avoid equipment. The escape holes are all in good operating condition. There is also a 36 foot steel ventilation line in place that runs for approximately 75 feet into the prospect.",
      "The West Lease comprises approximately 54,990 acres. Most importantly, the purchase of the surface lease gave us unrestricted surface access for the potential development and mining of our Round Top Project.. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, $45,000 payments due in June 2016 and 2017 had not been paid; consequently, we expensed the value of the West Lease during fiscal 2017. We fully intend to continue with the evaluation of the mineral potential of the property, to ultimately mine the property, and to bring the lease current when funds are available. October 2014 Surface Option and Water Lease\nOn October 29, 2014, we announced that we had executed agreements with the Texas General Land Office securing the option to purchase the surface rights covering the potential Round Top project mine and plant areas and, separately, a lease to develop the water necessary for the potential Round Top project mine operations. The option to purchase the surface rights covers approximately 5,670 acres over the mining lease and the additional acreage adequate to site all potential heap leaching and processing operations as currently anticipated by the Company. We may exercise the option for all or part of the option acreage at any time during the sixteen year primary term of the mineral lease. The option can be kept current by an annual payment of $10,000. The purchase price will be the appraised value of the surface at the time of exercising the option. The annual payment for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017 and 2018 has not been made as of the date of this filing.

      "A) The presence of movable light oil in the Middle Eocene reservoir suggests a larger gas reservoir may exist in the same formation.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Despite elevated gas readings being recorded during drilling, these tests resulted in no discernable flow from the formation and without any hydrocarbons being detected. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the Cretaceous reservoir at this location is tight unlike the rocks encountered in other wells in the area. This conclusion was confirmed by a low pressure hydro squeeze which was performed over two separate zones with the data obtained suggesting that these rocks are tight and lack permeability. Further tests were carried out of potential reservoir units in the overlying Middle and Lower Eocene sequences. Three separate tests were conducted with a total of 79 feet (24 metres) of sandstones being perforated and flow tested. These tests produced water with gas flow to surface in flareable quantities, but non commercial volumes. Each interval was flow tested for a number of days over which there was no increase in the amount of gas produced and the testing was subsequently terminated. On October 18, 2007 we announced that the Kumisi #1 was being plugged and abandoned. The well results, particularly for the Cretaceous interval, will be reviewed and incorporated into our technical evaluation of the area in order to fully understand the remaining potential of the Kumisi area. As part of this analysis consideration will be given to acid fracture stimulation techniques as a means by which to enhance permeability within the prospect. As no water has been recovered from the well, management believes that potential for a large gas prospect may still exist up-dip of the WR16 well given better reservoir quality. Norio (Block XIC) and North Kumisi Production Sharing Agreement (\u201cNorio PSA\u201d) In December 2000, CanArgo, through its then 50% owned subsidiary CanArgo Norio Limited (\u201cCNL\u201d), entered into a third production sharing contract with the State of Georgia represented by Georgian Oil and the State Agency for Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources in Georgia. The Norio PSA covers the Norio and North\nKumisi blocks of East Georgia, an exploration area of approximately 265,122 acres (1,061 Km 2 ), following the first contractual relinquishment in April 2006, adjacent to the Ninotsminda and Samgori Fields.",
      "Before the well could be drilled to the planned depth and tested, the bottom hole assembly (BHA) became stuck due to hole collapse. Subsequent attempts to retrieve the BHA were not successful and we decided to abandon the lower target due to a limited chance of sidetracking the well at this depth in a small diameter hole and to focus our attention on the shallower oil discovery in the overlying Oligocene sands which were the secondary target for the well. From the data obtained from the Middle Eocene (the primary target for the well) we believe that an oil discovery has been made at this level, and that the reservoir has exhibited both permeability (evidenced by drilling mud losses whilst drilling) and the presence of movable light oil. As such, even though the Middle Eocene has not been fully evaluated, the MK72 well has encountered the Middle Eocene\nreservoir on prognosis, and with hydrocarbons thus achieving many of the objectives of this wildcat exploration well. A comprehensive testing program on the oil bearing Oligocene sandstones encountered in the Norio MK72 well commenced in mid-March 2006 when a total of 322 feet (98 metres) of net sands were perforated over the interval 12,096 feet (3,687 metres) to 13,622 feet (4,152 metres). These sands had good oil shows whilst drilling, with oil to surface and with hydrocarbons being interpreted on the electric logs which also indicated a substantial thickness of net pay sands. Following an extensive testing program, the well sustained flow on a small choke size with low average gross fluid rates of approximately 13 barrels per day consisting of light 48.6\u00baAPI oil, gas and water. A number of surge clean up flows, a re-perforation of selected intervals, and a \u201clow\u201d pressure hydrofrac using our own pumping unit have been attempted but these have not improved reservoir deliverability. It is believed that the current flow is limited to a thinner, less permeable, interval whilst the better quality reservoir remains isolated due to potential reservoir damage caused by the invasive fluid damage of the drilling mud."

      "B) The replacement of tertiary stage vertical shaft impact crushers in 1998.",
      "C) The higher waste-to-ore strip ratio in 1997.",
      "D) The lower average grade of ore mined in 1997."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Although ore production does not reach maximum capacity in some years, mining of higher grade ore in these periods with an increase in contained gold and silver ounces does somewhat offset the effect of the lower ore production. The average gold produced over years 2 to 11 is approximately 74,000 oz per year with a maximum of 99,000 oz in Year 8 of production. The average silver produced is approximately 781,000 oz per year over this same period, with a maximum of 1.27 million oz of silver in Year 4 of production. Waste rock mining ranges from a low of approximately 8 million tons (7.3 million tonnes) in Year 1 to a high of approximately 20 million tons (18.2 million tonnes) in Years 5 and 6. The variation in waste rock mining rates is driven by a combination of factors. The current mine production schedule seeks to take advantage of the available ore processing capacity limit of approximately 5.1 million tons (4.7 million tonnes) per year especially during the initial five years of the Project. This results in periods of very high waste production as zones with high mining ratios, i.e. waste tons:ore tons, must be mined in order to expose sufficient ore. In addition, the requirement to ensure the most efficient disposal of waste rock in mined-out phases of the open pits combined with the steep topography leads to truck haulage distances that can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The initial mine life is projected to be 12 years. Note that aggregate sales over a period of thirty years are important for the Project as this will ensure that GQM LLC can meet its closure and closing reclamation requirements. Ore-from-waste separation will require special attention to ensure that overall grade projections are met. Underground mine openings will be encountered from time-to-time during open pit mining and this will be allowed for in the detailed mine planning. Norwest reviewed and confirmed operating cost estimates for the open pit operation for the 2015 updated feasibility study.",
      "Gold is recovered from leach solutions in a carbon adsorption plant and refined into dore bars on site. The Company increased the initial design production rate to approximately 85,000 ounces per year in 1999. The Briggs Mine was constructed in 1996 and, through December 31, 2002, has produced 476,991 ounces of gold and 132,362 ounces of silver. Since 1996, a total of 66.9 million tons of rock have been mined by open-pit methods, including 44.8 million tons of waste. Of the 22.1 million tons of ore mined, 18.3 million tons have been crushed and, along with 3.7 million tons of run-of-mine ore and 0.1 million tons of underground ore, have been placed on the leach pad. A total of 668,128 ounces of gold has been placed on the leach pad during this period. Recoverable ounces in leach-pad inventory at December 31, 2002, were 33,360 ounces of gold. During 1997, 9.3 million tons were mined, of which 2.8 million tons were ore with an average grade of 0.033 ounce of gold per ton and a waste-to-ore strip ratio of 2.3 to 1. The Briggs Mine produced 66,769 ounces of gold and 19,215 ounces of silver in 1997. Lower crushing throughput and higher than expected operating costs were experienced in 1997, principally relating to unsatisfactory performance of the tertiary stage vertical shaft impact crushers. In early 1998, these units were replaced with three cone crushers with the objective of reducing costs and increasing throughput. A scheduled expansion of the leach pad was completed during 1997 at a cost of $2.1 million. This expansion was financed by drawing on the final $4.0 million tranche of the Company's loan facility. (See \"Item 1 - Business - Financing.\") During 1998, 10.5 million tons were mined, of which 3.4 million tons were crusher ore with an average grade of 0.030 ounce of gold per ton and a waste-to-ore strip ratio of 2.0 to 1. The Briggs Mine produced 80,316 ounces of gold and 22,138 ounces of silver in 1998. During 1999, 9.8 million tons were mined, of which 4.3 million tons were crusher ore with an average grade of 0.028 ounce of gold per ton and 0.9 million tons were run-of-mine (non-crusher) ore with an average grade of 0.012 ounce of gold per ton."

      "However, we have a nominal amount of cash at this time and no plan to raise additional money through the sale of equity or borrow money from a traditional lending source. Ms. Rubio has verbally committed to the Company that he will fund the costs of preparing the Company's Exchange Act reports (Form 10-Ks, Form 10-Qs, Form 8-Ks) for the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 if the Company's current amount of cash is insufficient. However, Ms. Rubio has not committed to pay such costs beyond the preparation of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. In the event that Ms. Rubio fails to pay such costs and the Company's current amount of cash is insufficient, the Company's common stock would likely be limited to quotation on the Pink Sheets and no market for the common stock would develop or, if a market did develop, the market for our common stock would not exist for very long. Investors in our common stock could lose part or all of their investment in our shares. FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK\nFrom its inception on October 31, 2008, the Company has been funded by its sole officer and director and from proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. We have generated no revenues or profits through December 31, 2010. We also have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. As of December 31, 2010, we had incurred a net loss of approximately $41,596 since inception. From December 2009, until March 23, 2010, we issued an aggregate of 2,932,559 shares to a total of 54 investors at a purchase price of $.01 per share for an aggregate amount of $29,325. We have generated no revenue since inception and our loss from operations was $38,339 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. There was no activity in the Company for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Net cash used by operating activities was $32,489 and net cash provided by financing activities was $32,545 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.",
      "The net cash used in or provided by operating activities for both years is mainly attributable to the net loss or the net income each year. There was no cash provided by or used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities was $51,882 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and was primarily from loan payable proceeds. Net cash used in financing activities was $16,100 for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily from member distributions. CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has financed operations primarily through cash flows from operations, officer advances, and debt and equity financings. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur capital, inventory, administrative and other expenses. The Company's current monthly \"burn rate\" is approximately $13,800, which includes aggregate monthly fees of $10,000 for two consultants that are being accrued until funds are available for payment. We are in the process of forming a funding strategy to raise approximately $500,000 in order to fully implement our business plan, which includes recruiting and hiring additional individuals, expanding our inventory and obtaining additional licenses and certifications, as discussed in the Business Development - Short-Term Growth section of the Description of Business. We have not decided on a funding strategy yet and we have no firm commitments from any investors to date. Our monthly \"burn rate\" will increase to approximately $17,250 per month if we are successful in raising the approximate $500,000 in funding. The Company will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. There are no additional financing requirements required to maintain and continue the Company's operations during the next twelve months."

      "The power for this property is diesel-generated on site. GEOLOGY\nThe Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Pre-Cambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Kim/Cass zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides. ORE RESERVES Due to the suspension of operations in 1997, no portion of the Colomac dyke is included as part of mineable reserves. Similarly, none of the Kim/Cass property is included as part of mineable reserves and instead has been reclassified to the mineralized material category. GIANT MINE\nSELECTED OPERATING DATA\nBACKGROUND\nThe Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in continuous production since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all-weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the center of the property. Mining is conducted underground and the ore is processed with an on-site mill. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7.6 million ounces of gold. In 1996 the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure which accesses the Supercrest orebody and large scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 opt gold in situ compared to 0.301 ounces of gold per ton at Giant. The net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $57.2 million as of December 31, 1997. The Nicholas Lake property, which was acquired in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife.",

    "documentation": [
      "GSWL also owns and operates the Hwini-Butre and Benso mines located 80 km and 50 km, respectively, south of Wassa. In 2008, following completion of a 50 km haul road, we started mining at Benso and began hauling its ore to Wassa for processing. In May 2009, following completion of a 30 km road extension, the Hwini-Butre mine began trucking ore to the Wassa processing plant. The Benso and Hwini-Butre mines include multiple open pits at both locations as well as mining equipment, equipment repair shops, warehouses and other ancillary support equipment and buildings. Mining was completed at Benso in February 2012. Mining is expected to continue at Hwini-Butre through mid-2014. Geology at Wassa\nWassa lies within the Eburnean Tectonic Province in the West African Precambrian Shield. The Proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the West African craton and host the major gold mineralization in Ghana are subdivided into meta-sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Birimian and Tarkwaian sequences. Wassa is hosted within the same Birimian volcano-sedimentary greenstone package as Bogoso/Prestea. However, Wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the Ashanti Belt while Bogoso and Prestea occur along the northwestern flank. The volcano-sedimentary sequence hosting the Wassa deposit has been affected by four deformational events spanning across the Eoeburnean (age 2.1-2.2 billion years) and Eburnean orogeny (age 2.1 billion years). The associated gold mineralization which has developed during the earlier Eoeburnean deformational event and subsequently deformed during the Eburnean event has\nresulted in a complex re-folded vein system at the Wassa mine. During the Eoeburnean deformation, a series of tight isoclinal folds and a strong fabric marked by chlorites, ankerite, and gold-bearing elongated pyrite was developed along with numerous quartz-ankerite veins. The gold-bearing veins along with the early isoclinal folds were re-folded along a large-scale synform during the Eburnean event. The early isoclinal folds control the distribution of high grade mineralization at depth which have been intercepted by the deep drilling program and will continue to be the main focus of the 2013 Wassa exploration program.",
      "We expect Bogoso/Prestea will produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold in 2010 from sulfide ores at an average cash operating cost of approximately $650 per ounce. The Wassa Gold Mine\nOverview of the Wassa Gold Mine\nWe own and operate the Wassa gold mine located approximately 35 kilometers east of Bogoso/Prestea in southwest Ghana. The property was acquired in 2001 from a former owner who had operated Wassa as a heap leach gold mine. The property, as now constituted, includes a series of open-pits, a nominal 3.0 million tonne per annum CIL processing plant with its crushing and grinding circuits, a fleet of mining equipment, ancillary facilities including an administration building, a warehouse, a maintenance shop, a stand-by power generating facility and an employee residential complex. We completed construction of the CIL processing plant in early 2005, and the plant was placed in commercial service on April 1, 2005. Wassa also owns and operates the Hwini-Butre and Benso mines located 80 and 50 km, respectively, south of Wassa. In the third quarter of 2008, following completion of a 50 km haul road, we started mining at Benso and began hauling its ore to Wassa for processing.

      "A) The company aims to exploit the shallow, easily accessible silver deposits found in the upper regions of the mine.",

      "D) Sterling Mining Company is seeking to capitalize on the historical success of previous mining operations in the \"upper country\" target zones."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The combination of faults, fractures, folds and favorable host rocks found in the District has created suitable conditions for lead-zinc-silver mineralization. The geology of the District may display little or no indication of mineralization on the surface, and many of the successful silver mines in the District did not realize their full potential and best grade of ore until after a depth of at least 1700 feet was reached in the development and exploration. Examples include\nthe Galena, Sunshine and Lucky Friday Mines thus, mining claims in the District, often require deep drilling from the surface or underground drilling to determine whether commercial grade ore bodies are present. Exploration of land near major mines is often easier to target for exploration and development from existing shafts. In other silver producing areas, a deposit may bottom out at a few thousand feet below surface. However, in the Coeur d\u2019Alene District, this is not the case, as deep extensions of primarily silver mineralization are faulted and folded, which may have moved the favorable host rocks deeper. Sunshine Property\nBackground\nThe Sunshine Mine was a significant primary silver mine from 1884 to 2001. The mine facility includes extensive underground workings including shafts, levels, raises and ramp systems extending to depths of 6,000 feet below ground and a broad database reflecting over 100 years of exploration, development and production. The mine ceased production in the first quarter of 2001 as a result of several factors, including the low price of silver and the lack of regular and consistent exploration and development activities. Sterling Mining Company acquired control of the Sunshine Mine in June 2003 through a lease with option to purchase agreement. Beginning in August 2003, and followed by the initial drilling in the fall of 2004, Sterling is continuing and expanding an exploration program. The process of rehabilitation of the underground areas of the mine began in late 2004, and the Company is methodically working towards returning the Sunshine Mine to long-term sustained production with a business model that incorporates determining reserves not only in traditional target areas, but also in a new \u201cupper country\u201d target zones.",
      "The cleanup of the old smelter, zinc plant, and associated sites has now been completed and the Mine is now poised for development and an eventual return to production. The Company has been in contact with government officials and other local stakeholders who have expressed strong support and cooperation for the Company in its efforts to return the mine to a productive, modern and sustainable mining asset. Geology and Mineralization\nGeology\nThe Coeur d\u2019Alene Mining District is one of the most prolific mining districts in North America. It has been in constant production since its discovery in the 1880s, historically is the second largest silver-producing area in the world, and is one of the largest zinc and lead producers, as well. Over 100 mines historically have reached commercial production in the District, which currently hosts two major mines, the Lucky Friday/Gold Hunter owned by Hecla Mining Company, and the Galena Mine, owned by America\u2019s Silver. A number of other mines including the Sunshine, the Crescent, and the Coeur Mine have the potential to be re-started should silver prices rise sufficiently to justify reactivation. The geology of the Silver Valley district occurs within the Precambrian meta-sedimentary rocks of the Belt-Purcell Supergroup, a Middle Proterozoic sedimentary basin occurring primarily in western Montana, Idaho and Southeastern British Columbia. In the Coeur d\u2019Alene region these comprise a 21,000\u2019 thick sequence of clastic, (argillites, siltites, and quartzites) and carbonate sedimentary rocks. These rocks have been metamorphosed and strongly deformed by compressional tectonics during the Sevier Orogenic event of the cretaceous age. Following this, later in the cretaceous age, the Bitterroot Lobe of the Idaho Batholith was emplaced to the south of the Coeur d\u2019Alene district which was accompanied by dike emplacement. The mining district lies within the west-central part of a regional tectonic lineament known as the Lewis and Clark line, a major fault system, consisting of numerous faults that display strike slip, normal and reverse movements over a protracted geological history."

      "However, the public anti-nuclear lobby can make environmental permitting difficult and permit timing less than predictable. In Texas, the radioactive materials license required for ISL uranium mining is granted by the Texas Department of Health (\"TDH\") and the UIC permits are granted by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (\"TNRCC\"). The TNRCC also regulates air quality and surface deposition or discharge of treated wastewater associated with the ISL mining process. In order for a licensee to receive final release from further radioactive materials license obligations after all of its mining and post-mining clean-up has been completed, approval must be issued by the TDH along with concurrence from the NRC. In New Mexico, radioactive materials' licensing is handled directly by the NRC, rather than by the State of New Mexico. Furthermore, depending upon whether a site located within New Mexico falls under state or Navajo Nation jurisdiction, the permitting of the UIC aspects of ISL mining may be conducted by either the New Mexico Environmental Department (\"NMED\") or the EPA or possibly both in case of jurisdictional conflict. The jurisdictional issue when raised as to any development property, could result in litigation between the state and the EPA, with the possibility of delays in the issuance of affected UIC permits. The Company is currently a party to such litigation with respect to certain of its New Mexico properties. See \"Litigation\". Water is essential to the ISL process. It is readily available in South Texas for the Company's operations and obtaining water rights is not required because water is subject to capture. In New Mexico the use of water rights is administered through the New Mexico State Engineer subject to Indian tribal jurisdictional claims. The State Engineer carefully and strictly regulates obtaining new water rights, and the transfer or change in use of existing water rights. The State Engineer may also grant an application for a \"temporary water right\" which will not establish a vested right but may provide a sufficient quantity of water to fulfill the applicant's needs.",

During 2002 and 2003, geologic mapping and petrographic studies were performed. An electron microprobe analytical study was conducted on field samples, quartz products and feldspar products from earlier work. Following petrographic and microprobe studies, select intervals of residual deposits from the 2000-2001 drilling program were sent to Mineral Resource Laboratory (MRL) for process testing. Since 2003, all exploration work completed on the property has involved diamond core drilling. The Mineral Resource estimate in this study report is based on data and information gathered during these diamond drilling programs. The exploration work we conducted was used to target generalized rock types and their weathering by-products. The work was successful in defining four target areas which were subsequently tested by diamond drilling. SRK Consulting (SRK) reviewed the exploration procedures and sampling methods as part of the pre-feasibility study completed in 2014 and found that the work was conducted by trained professionals to industry standards for a deposit of this type.",
      "The work done by GMT indicates that the quality of the residual clay from the WBL pit is high enough to be used in some high-end specialty paper, paint, and ceramic markets. Work done by I-Minerals and further continued by GMT show that a wet process using proven gravity separation equipment can produce a high-quality halloysite product that will gain attention of halloysite markets. Deposit Type\nThe mineral deposit consists of residual deposits containing primarily K-spar, quartz and clays. The mineral deposit is underlain by the Thatuna Batholith, composed mainly of plagioclase feldspar, K-spar and quartz. Weathering has created a residual saprolite horizon which directly overlies the bedrock from which it was derived. During the natural processes of weathering, the original plagioclase feldspars have preferentially broken down to produce the clays kaolinite and halloysite. The K-spars have resisted weathering to a degree and much of the original component remains as free grains. Similarly, the quartz component of the host rock remains as free grains in the weathered material.

      "The brine concentrations and brine density were confirmed by us recently, but values for the aquifer thickness and the porosity were obtained from literature published by other sources. Probable reserves for the shallow brine at the Wendover facility were calculated from KCl contained in the shallow aquifer based on estimates of porosity and thickness over the reserve area. The distance for projection of probable reserves is a radius of three-quarters of a mile from points of measurement of brine concentration. Probable reserves for the deep-brine aquifer were estimated based on historical draw-down and KCl brine concentrations. The ore grade (% KCl) for both the shallow and deep aquifer is the percentage by weight of KCl in the brine. A portion of these reserves are within the West mine boundary. The classification of the reserve as being associated with the East mine is a result of where the ore is intended to be processed. Production\nOur facilities have a current estimated annual productive capacity of approximately 390,000 tons of potash, and approximately 400,000 tons of langbeinite, based on current design. Our annual production rates are less than our estimated productive capacity. Actual production is affected by operating rates, the grade of ore mined, recoveries, mining rates, evaporation rates, product pricing, and the amount of development work that we perform.

      "The brine concentrations and brine density were confirmed by us recently, but values for the aquifer thickness and the porosity were obtained from literature published by other sources. Probable reserves for the shallow brine at the Wendover facility were calculated from KCl contained in the shallow aquifer based on estimates of porosity and thickness over the reserve area. The distance for projection of probable reserves is a radius of three-quarters of a mile from points of measurement of brine concentration. Probable reserves for the deep-brine aquifer were estimated based on historical draw-down and KCl brine concentrations. The ore grade (% KCl) for both the shallow and deep aquifer is the percentage by weight of KCl in the brine. A portion of these reserves are within the West mine boundary. The classification of the reserve as being associated with the East mine is a result of where the ore is intended to be processed. Production\nOur facilities have a current estimated annual productive capacity of approximately 390,000 tons of potash, and approximately 400,000 tons of langbeinite, based on current design. Our annual production rates are less than our estimated productive capacity. Actual production is affected by operating rates, the grade of ore mined, recoveries, mining rates, evaporation rates, product pricing, and the amount of development work that we perform. Therefore, as with other producers in our industry, our production results tend to be lower than reported productive capacity.

      "CGI generally receives between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and from 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from natural gas liquids sales. Under keep-whole gas purchase contracts, CGI retains all natural gas liquids recovered by its processing facilities and keeps the producers whole by returning to the producers at the tailgate of its plants an amount of residue gas equal on a BTU basis to the natural gas received at the plant inlet. The keep-whole component of the contract permits the Company to benefit when the value of natural gas liquids is greater as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream. OIL AND GAS MARKETING\nThe Company's oil and gas production is sold primarily under market sensitive or spot price contracts. The Company sells substantially all of its casinghead gas to purchasers under varying percentage-of-proceeds contracts. By the terms of these contracts, the Company receives a fixed percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The Company normally receives between 80% and 100% of the proceeds from natural gas sales and from 80% to 100% of the proceeds from natural gas liquids sales received by the Company's purchasers when the products are resold. The natural gas and natural gas liquids sold by these purchasers are sold primarily based on spot market prices. The revenues received by the Company from the sale of natural gas liquids is included in natural gas sales. As a result of the natural gas liquids contained in the Company's production, the Company has historically improved its price realization on its natural gas sales as compared to Henry Hub or other natural gas price indexes. For the year ended December 31, 1998, purchases of the Company's natural gas production by GPM Gas Corporation accounted for 11.5% of the Company's total gas sales for such period and for the same period purchases of the Company's oil production by Koch Oil Company accounted for 79.8% of the Company's total produced oil sales.",

      "The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement. Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating. Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable. In addition, we own approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Alexandria, Virginia, for our corporate office, with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases. As of December 31, 2005, our communities were classified as follows:\nOur holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages. Current Communities\nOur Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. In January 2006, we disposed of two communities containing an aggregate of 473 apartment homes. The Current Communities, as of January 31, 2006, include 106 garden-style (of which 14 are mixed communities and include townhomes), 20 high-rise and 15 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:\nOther features at various communities may include:\nWe also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team, focused on the specific\nneeds of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents."

    "documentation": [
      "Our capital budget for 2012 is up 37% from our 2011 capital budget, with 61% dedicated to development activities, split 63% offshore and 37% onshore. The capital allocated to our offshore development activities will assist us in converting the proved undeveloped reserves at the Mahogany field to proved developed producing reserves. The expected expenditures for offshore development represent a significant increase over both 2010 and 2011 expenditures. Acreage\nThe following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2011. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water. Approximately 82% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 9% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage. Index to Financial Statements For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, none of our rights will expire in 2012, 33,740 net acres (36%) could expire in 2013, 26,841 net acres (29%) could expire in 2014, 26,503 net acres (29%) could expire in 2015, and 5,760 net acres (6%) could expire in 2016 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, our rights to approximately 143,531 net acres (91%) could expire in 2012, 9,839 net acres (6%) could expire in 2013, 3,777 net acres (3%) could expire in 2014, and five net acres could expire thereafter. Of the undeveloped onshore leasehold, there are 140,885 net acres that can be extended by drilling two additional wells in 2012 and further extended by additional operations or production in future years. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2012, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage. Our net offshore acreage decreased 35,560 net acres (6%) from December 31, 2010 and our net onshore acreage increased 168,790 net acres from a minor ownership position as of December 31, 2010. The reduction in our net offshore acreage was attributable to certain offshore leases that terminated.",
      "Our capital budget for 2014 for development is $233.0 million, split 76% offshore and 24% onshore. The capital allocated to our development activities will assist us in converting the PUDs to PDs. Acreage\nThe following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2013. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water. Approximately 57% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 13% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage. For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, 78,113 net acres (25%) of the total 315,991 net undeveloped offshore acres could expire in 2014, 57,166 net acres (18%) could expire in 2015, 33,228 net acres (11%) could expire in 2016, 80,332 net acres (25%) could expire in 2017, and 67,152 net acres (21%) could expire in 2018 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, our rights to approximately 146,436 net acres of the total 158,310 net undeveloped onshore acres (93%) could expire in 2014 without additional drilling, 9,662 net acres (6%) could expire in 2015 and 2,212 net acres (1%) could expire in 2016. There are 141,109 net acres of the undeveloped onshore leasehold that can be extended by drilling two additional wells in 2014 and further extended by additional operations or production in future years. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2014 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage. Our net offshore acreage decreased 49,387 net acres (6%) from December 31, 2012 and our net onshore acreage decreased 1,493 net acres (1%) from December 31, 2012. The decrease in our net offshore acreage was primarily due to certain offshore leases that terminated, partially offset by acreage added from the Callon Properties acquisition and other offshore property interests acquired through purchase."

      "See the discussion of the rate cases in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In 2004, NS' railroads were found by the STB not to be \u201crevenue adequate\u201d based on results for the year 2003. A railroad is \u201crevenue adequate\u201d under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital. This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement and does not adversely impact NS' liquidity or capital resources. K6\nPASSENGER OPERATIONS -\nRegularly scheduled passenger trains are operated by Amtrak on NS' lines between Alexandria and New Orleans , between Greensboro and Selma , North Carolina , between Chicago , Illinois , and Detroit , Michigan , and between Chicago and Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . Commuter trains are operated on the NS line between Manassas and Alexandria in accordance with contracts with two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia . NS also leases the Chicago to Manhattan , Illinois , line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois. NS operates lines on which Amtrak conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations. In addition, NS provides freight service over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations, and is conducting freight operations over some trackage\nowned by Amtrak or by New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company and Maryland DOT. Finally, passenger operations are conducted either by Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas. NONCARRIER OPERATIONS -\nNS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment. In 2004, no such noncarrier\nsubsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier\nsubsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.",
      "In 1997, NS Rail was found by the STB to be \"revenue adequate\" based on results for the year 1996. A railroad is \"revenue adequate\" under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital. The revenue adequacy measure is one of several factors considered by the STB when it is called upon to rule on the reasonableness of regulated rates. PASSENGER OPERATIONS - Regularly scheduled passenger operations on NS Rail's lines consist of Amtrak trains operating between Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Charlotte and Selma, North Carolina. Commuter trains are operated on the NS Rail line between Manassas and Alexandria under contract with two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Both of these services are under contracts providing for reimbursement of related expenses incurred by NS Rail. NS Rail also leases the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois. Should the Conrail transaction become effective as proposed, NS Rail will accommodate substantially increased Amtrak and commuter passenger mileage and will conduct significant freight operations over trackage owned by Amtrak or by commuter entities. RAILWAY PROPERTY: The average age of the freight car fleet at Dec. 31, 1997, was 23.1 years. During 1997, 2,250 freight cars were retired. As of Dec. 31, 1997, the average age of the locomotive fleet was 15.3 years. During 1997, 78 locomotives, the average age of which was 23.3 years, were retired. Since 1988, more than 25,100 coal cars have been rebodied. As a result, the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years. Ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment marketability. In past years, the freight car bad order ratio reflected the storage of certain types of cars which were not in high demand."

      "We also assess a need for an allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We assess the recoverability of inventory, long-lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess our exposure to current commitments and contingencies. It should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing concern considerations\nAs of March 31, 2013, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2.8 million, losses from operations totaling $1.6 million for Fiscal 2013, other income totaling $2.7 million for Fiscal 2013 and a net income of $1.5 million for Fiscal 2013. Please note that the Company\u2019s other income section of the profit and loss statement is significantly influenced by the fluctuations in the fair value of outstanding preferred share and warrant derivatives, and that such fair values strongly correlate to and vary inversely with the market share price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The Company does not anticipate being profitable for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014. In addition, the Company has received Notice of Default from the Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of the debt service reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the Company\u2019s failure to make scheduled principal payment. See \u201cNJEDA Bonds\u201d below. As of March 31, 2013, we had cash reserves of $0.4 million. The Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement and Treppel $1,000,000 bridge revolving credit line (the \u201cTreppel Credit Line\u201d) are expected to provide additional funds to permit us to continue development of our product pipeline. There can, however, be no assurances that the Company will receive a sufficient amount of the funds provided for under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement (please see \u201cPurchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital\u201d below).",
      "The Company has never generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company\u2019s working capital deficiency of $115,148 and accumulated losses of $199,548 since its inception raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet transactions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to impairment of long-lived assets, donated expenses and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following are either (i) critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates or assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements or (ii) other key accounting policies that generally do not require us to make estimates or assumptions but may require us to make difficult or subjective judgments:\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measures\nThe financial instruments of the Company consist principally of cash, accounts payable and amounts due to related parties."

The Master Lease provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at each of the 224 Wholly Owned Properties initially included in the Master Lease (subject to certain exceptions and limitations). In addition, Seritage has the right to recapture any automotive care centers which are free-standing or attached as \u201cappendages\u201d to the properties, all outparcels or outlots and certain portions of parking areas and common areas. Upon exercise of this recapture right, we generally incur certain costs and expenses for the separation of the recaptured space from the remaining Sears Holdings space and can reconfigure and rent the recaptured space to diversified, non-Sears tenants on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account. The Master Lease also provides us the right to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Sears Holdings at each of 21 identified Wholly Owned Properties by making a specified lease termination payment to Sears Holdings, after which we expect to be able to reposition and re-lease those stores on potentially superior terms determined by us and for our own account.

      "The Holdco Master Lease, consistent with the Master Lease, provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Holdco at all properties (other than the five Tenant 100% Occupancy Properties described below).

Additionally, in contrast to the Master Lease, which permitted us to recapture 100% of 21 specified properties (out of the 224 properties originally leased under the Master Lease) upon payment of a specified lease recapture payment, the Holdco Master Lease provides us with the right, beginning in the second year of the term of the Holdco Master Lease, to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Holdco at any of the properties included in the Holdco Master Lease (other than the five Tenant 100% Occupancy Properties described below) without making a specified lease recapture payment to Holdco. The right to recapture 100% of any property is limited to 10 properties in each year of the Holdco Master Lease term, with carry-over rights if less than 10 properties are recaptured in any year of the Holdco Master Lease term. In the event of a 100% recapture of a property (or termination of a property by Holdco pursuant to which Holdco pays a termination fee) and any subsequent re-development of such property for retail purposes, if the property has store space that is suitable for a 10,000-20,000 square foot Sears or Kmart store, Holdco will have the right of first offer to lease such space at either (x) the same per square foot rent for such property under the Holdco Master Lease if the space is delivered in a \u201ccold dark shell\u201d condition or (y) if we provide a market tenant allowance, the lesser of (1) the market rent for such space or (2) 200% of the per square foot rent for such property under the Holdco Master Lease, with such election being at our discretion."

Power lines to oil production and refining facilities east and northwest of the Company\u2019s property holdings appear readily accessible. History. There has been little, if any, known exploration for lithium-enriched brines in the Railroad Valley area. Some exploration for potash-rich brines was undertaken in the 1920s by the US Geological Survey, but this work apparently did not discover sufficient resources to justify production. The area has been the site of the most intensive petroleum exploration and production activities in Nevada. Several oil fields were discovered east and north of the Company\u2019s properties, and these production facilities remain active. Geology. The Railroad Valley is a large \u201cclosed\u201d topographic and drainage basin that is bounded on the east side by a very thick sequence of Paleozoic siliciclastic and carbonate rocks, and by a large block of Tertiary-age felsic and mafic volcanic rocks on its west flank.",

      "A) The Staggers Act",
      "B) The Clean Air Act",
      "C) The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)",

      "State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. BNSF Railway\u2019s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF Railway\u2019s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF Railway is now subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF Railway may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF Railway, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF Railway may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF Railway operations. Further discussion is incorporated by reference from Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",
      "Over 95.0 percent of FECR's freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts. Due, in part, to industry consolidation and certain service issues, efforts were made in 2000 to re-subject the rail industry to federal economic regulation. This pressure could continue during 2001. The Staggers\nAct encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry. Accordingly, the nation's rail carriers can be expected to vigorously oppose these ongoing efforts to re-impose such economic regulation. RAILWAY AND TRUCKING\nThe Company's transportation operations, both rail and trucking, are also subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including the federal Clean Air Act (CERCLA), and various other environmental laws and regulations. Violations of various statutory and regulatory programs can result in civil penalties, remediation expenses, natural resource damage claims, potential injunctions, cease and desist orders and criminal penalties. Some environmental statutes impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition, the Company's present and historic ownership and operation of real property, including rail yards, in connection with its transportation operations involve the storage, use or disposal of hazardous substances that may have contaminated and may in the future contaminate the environment. The Company may also be liable for the costs of cleaning up a site at which it has disposed (intentionally or unintentionally of hazardous substances by virtue of, for example, an accident, derailment or leak), or to which it has transported hazardous substances it generated, such as waste oil. The Company is currently involved in various remediations of properties relating to its transportation operations. In addition, FECR, along with many other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party in proceedings under Federal statutes for the clean up of designated Superfund sites (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings)."

      "We have received a positive response from local and national politicians and citizens for our efforts in helping the small mining cooperatives to improve their practices, and for assisting in providing a stimulus to the local economy. As part of the custom milling business, we enter into contracts with the small mining groups and advance funds in the form of equipment and working capital, and collect such advances from ore delivered to the sampling and crushing plant. As of December 31, 2005, we had a receivable from small mining cooperatives totaling $2.0 million, net of a reserve of $1.1 million. The net book value of the plant and equipment associated with the custom milling business was $2.6 million at December 31, 2005. In addition, we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of $0.2 million. The San Sebastian Unit\nThe San Sebastian mine is located approximately 56 miles northeast of the city of Durango, Mexico, on concessions acquired in 1999. Access to San Sebastian is via Mexico highway 40, approximately 12 kilometers east of Guadalupe Victoria, and then approximately 23 kilometers of paved rural road through the towns of Ignacio Allende and Emiliano Zapata. The processing plant is located near Velarde\u00f1a, Durango, Mexico, and was acquired in April 2001. Our concession holdings cover approximately 200-square miles, including the Francine vein, the Don Sergio vein and multiple outlying active exploration areas. Production from the Francine vein has been from a high-grade silver vein with significant gold credits. Production from the Don Sergio vein has been from a high-grade gold vein with some silver credits. Mineral concession titles are obtained and held under the laws of Mexico, and are valid for 50 years with the possibility of extending another 50 years. There are work assessment and tax requirements that are variable and increase with the time that the concession is held. Several epithermal veins within the Saladillo Valley include the Francine, Profesor, Middle and North vein systems that are proximal to each other and hosted within a series of shales with\ninterbedded fine-grained sandstones interpreted to belong to the Cretaceous Caracol Formation.",
      "These employees are not represented by a bargaining agent. We have primarily used third-party contractors for mining and operation of the processing facility. The hourly employees of the owner of the processing facility are represented by the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores Mineros, Metal\u00fargicos, Sider\u00fargicos y Similares de la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana (a Mexico national union) as bargaining agent. At December 31, 2020, the net book value of the San Sebastian unit property and its associated plant and equipment was $7.8 million. Infrastructure includes the underground mine portal and development, a water supply system, maintenance shop, warehouse, laboratory, leased mill and related improvements, and various offices. Equipment and facilities are in good condition. As of December 31, 2020, $6.9 million has been accrued for reclamation and closure costs. All permits required for current mining of the open pits and the underground mine and operation of the mill are in place. In late 2018 and early 2019, a new vein, called the El Toro Vein, was discovered approximately 1.3 miles south of the San Sebastian Mine Area under thick soil cover. Drilling throughout 2019 at the El Toro Vein area defined oxide mineralization over 1.3 miles of strike length and 900 feet downdip. In late 2019 infill drilling was conducted on key portions of the El Toro Vein. With the recent El Toro discovery, we believe the combined strike length of the primary veins at the project (Francine, Andrea, Middle, North and El Toro) is over 6 miles. Exploration activities in 2020 consisted primarily of core drilling at two recently discovered veins, referred to as the El Bronco and El Tigre Veins, discovered under soil cover through our 2020 Short Vertical Reverse Circulation (\"SVRC\") drilling program. SVRC drilling has proven to be an effective method for exploring for new veins under thick soil cover. For 2021, additional core drilling is planned at the El Bronco and El Tigre Vein target areas. The 2021 SVRC drilling program is expected to focus on the soil covered areas located south and west of the San Sebastian Mine; an area that we believe to be highly prospective for the discovery of new veins."

Waste includes 12.18 million tonnes of overburden\nRecovery of gold is expected to be approximately 97%. Exploration\nAs of December 31, 2004, we had completed a total of 398 surface diamond drill holes totaling over 125,898 meters as well as 210 underground holes totaling 41,065 meters giving a to-date total for both of 166,963 meters as shown in the table below. Our drilling supplemented the data from the 284 surface and 720 underground drill holes drilled by the previous owners. A table of total drill holes is show below. The objectives for the 2004 surface drilling were: 1) to better define the open pit reserves, 2) to extend our resources along strike 3) to extend resources in the eastern and western extensions of the main structure, bracketing or undercutting known gold-bearing zones and 4) to explore known geophysical targets. In April 2004, the surface exploration drilling discovered a new orebody in the footwall of the Dester-Porcupine Fault. The discovery hole was based on the extension of an IP anomaly. There are two components to the mineralization, the quartz breccia veins and the massive sulfide mineralization (Pb, Zn, Ag). These appear to be two mineralizing events sharing the same \u201cplumbing system.\u201d Very good gold mineralization is evident within easy reach of our surface rigs and this will be a target for the 2005 drilling program.

Mineral Reserves\nOn April 14, 2008, we filed a Canadian National Instrument, NI 43-101 Technical Report, which was prepared to a bankable standard (\u201cbankable feasibility study\u201d). A bankable feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis of a project\u2019s economics (+/- 15% precision) used by the banking industry for financing purposes. The table below summarizes the Black Fox Total Mineral Reserve as of December 31, 2008. The mineral reserves shown in the table below were calculated based on a gold price of $650 per ounce. Black Fox Probable Reserve Statement as of December 31, 2008\n(1) Underground reserves assume 95% mining recovery 17% planned dilution and 5% unplanned dilution both at 0 grams per tonne grade. The reserve estimates were based on information from 1,893 drill holes totaling 338,842 meters. All assays over 170 grams of gold per tonne (5.5 oz of gold per ton) were capped at this level, which represents 0.25% of the assays. The estimated reserves presented above were reduced by mining of 632,000 ore tonnes from the Black Fox mine, including 425,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.7 gpt producing 46,621 ounces of gold from the Black Fox mill, with further 5,531 ounces of gold produced from toll processing in 2009. There was no updated estimation of mineral reserves for the year ended December 31, 2009. This was due mainly to the Company undertaking in late 2009 a comprehensive mine plan re-modeling with tighter constraints and review of the 2010 mine plan as well as the life of mine plan to address the grade variability issue of a certain type of Black Fox ore, which had resulted in an over-projection of grade in part of the open pit ore."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "A total of 36 drill holes totaling 4,621 meters have thus far tested three principal target areas: the Colonia, Patoa and Tucanare prospects. At the main Colonia trend, a mineralized east-west structure has been traced by drilling for about 500 meters. This trend remains open in both directions along horizontal strike and at depth. Of the two holes drilled this year at the new Jamil prospect in the southern part of the Colonia area, one contained 10.4 meters of 8 g/t gold. The one hole drilled in another completely new area, Dorado, in the northern part of the Colonia area intersected 10.1 g/t over 2 meters. At Patoa, previously announced drill holes SB-04, that intersected 12.2 meters grading 12.2 g/t gold, and SB-18, that intersected 34 meters grading 2.7 g/t gold, may represent the same mineralized trend. In addition, SB-20, that contained 25.5 meters of 1.6 g/t gold, was drilled 600 meters west of the main Patoa area and represents significant untested potential of the Patoa zone. Finally, at the Tucanare prospect, all five drill holes have intersected gold mineralization. 8. Sampling and Analysis\nSoils were taken over large areas and analyzed by assay and by panning to aid in exploration. Auger samples up to 10 meters in depth were also taken in selected areas and analyzed similarly. Sawed core samples were transported from the drill to the camp by vehicle then by truck, boat or plane to the nearest population center where they were air transported to central Brazil for sample preparation at ALS Chemex Laboratories in Goianania or SGS Laboratories in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Final analysis for samples sent to ALS Chemex was completed in the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada or in Lima, Peru. <PAGE>\n9. Security of Samples\nThe geologist in charge supervised the collection of samples on site and the shipping from the site to the point of air transport. Sample tracking by Solitario incorporated transport records and sample receipt by the laboratory in Brazil. Shipping outside of Brazil was supervised by the laboratory.",
      "In 2006 we conducted induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey to further aid us in selecting drill-hole locations. 6. Mineralization\nGold mineralization has been detected by detailed soil sampling over an area that is at least five kilometers long in an east-west direction and 4 kilometers wide in a north-south direction. In bedrock, gold mineralization occurs along steeply dipping shears in the granite and along dike boundaries of later, finer grained phases of granite. Gold enrichment occurs in E-W trending zones. Pyrite is the only common sulfide mineral but it occurs only in small amounts, generally from 1/2% to 3%. Rarely, galena, chalcopyrite and sphalerite have been observed in trace amounts. Quartz as veinlets and as veins up to 30 cm are most commonly associated with gold mineralization, though silicification as a replacement texture is important locally. Silver values and the quantities of other valuable metals are uniformly low. <PAGE>\n7. Drilling\nSolitario drilled 12 core holes totaling 2,435 meters in 2005 and 11 core holes totaling 1,596 meters in 2006. A third round of drilling that began in late-2007 is scheduled to be completed by the end of February 2008. As of the end of February 2008, no assays of drill core for the third round of drilling have been received. Drill holes completed in 2005 and 2006 were located primarily in three widely-spaced prospect areas: the Patoa, Colonia and Tucanar\u00e9. Drill hole locations for 2007-2008 are more widely dispersed away from these prospects.

    "question": "Given the regulatory frameworks described in the provided text, in which state would a utility subsidiary of AEP be most likely to experience a significant change in its fuel cost recovery mechanism in the near future?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Ohio",
      "B) Virginia",
      "C) Arkansas",
      "D) Louisiana"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "A utility\u2019s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utility\u2019s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (ii) such utility\u2019s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. The rates of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCO\u2019s base rates are capped, subject to certain adjustments, at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists in Virginia. Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility\u2019s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.",
      "APCo and Wheeling Power Company are currently unable to change the current level of fuel cost recovery, though this ability could be reinstated in a future proceeding. Other Jurisdictions: The public utility subsidiaries of AEP also provide service at regulated bundled rates in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in Michigan. The following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of AEP operate:\n(1)\nRepresents the percentage of revenues from sales to retail customers from AEP utility companies operating in each state to the total AEP System revenues from sales to retail customers for the year ended December 31, 2004. (2)\nThe PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plan filed by CSPCo and OPCo that begins after the market development period and extends through December 31, 2008 during which OPCo\u2019s retail generation rates will increase 7% annually and CSPCo\u2019s retail generation rates will increase 3% annually. Distribution rates are frozen, with certain exceptions, through December 31, 2008. (3)\nRetail electric service in the ERCOT area of Texas is provided to most customers through unaffiliated REPs with TCC and TNC providing only regulated delivery services. Retail electric service in the SPP area of Texas is provided by SWEPCo and an affiliated REP. (4)\nCapped base rates pursuant to a 1999 settlement with base rate freeze extended pursuant to merger stipulation. The status of additional base and fuel clause rate caps, subject to certain conditions, is presently under discussion and there is an issue as to whether the freeze and cap extend through 2007 under an existing corporate separation stipulation agreement. The interim fuel clause rate cap expires in April 2005.\n(5)\nLegislation passed in 2004 capped base rates until December 31, 2010 and expanded the rate change opportunities to one full rate case (including generation, transmission and distribution) between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007 and one additional full rate case between July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010."

      "Comparable store sales of such restaurants which were open during all of the second quarters of both 1994 and 1993 declined by 4.5% between the two periods. Menu prices were not increased between the two periods. Management believes that several factors may have contributed to the comparable store sales decline including increased competition and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of restaurants remodeled since 1992 and the impact of newly opened restaurants on comparable store sales of existing restaurants in certain markets. Some of the factors impacting comparable store sales are believed to be negatively impacting sales volumes of newer restaurants opened since 1990. During the second quarter of 1994, the average sales volume of the 70 new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants opened in 1991 through 1993 was 3.3% lower than the average sales volume of existing restaurants during the same period. Revenues from the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants were $1.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 1993 due to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants on May 5, 1994. Costs and Expenses\nCosts and expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 96.0% in the second quarter of 1994 from 95.4% in the second quarter of 1993. Cost of sales increased as a percentage of revenues to 51.8% in the second quarter of 1994 from 51.2% in the comparable period of 1993. Cost of food, beverage, prize and merchandise items for Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 18.5% in the second quarter of 1994 from 18.3% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to an increase in costs relating to the enhancement of certain prize and merchandise items. Labor expenses for Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 30.3% during the second quarter of 1994 from 29.5% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to the decline in the comparable store sales.",
      "Included in operating income is a gain of $5.5 million related to the sale of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants and a $1.9 million loss associated with the valuation of fixed assets used in certain Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. The decline in operating income is primarily due to the decline in comparable store sales and operating margins in the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. A material portion of operating costs are fixed resulting in an erosion of operating margins at lower sales levels. A summary of the results of operations of the Company as a percentage of revenues for the six month periods is shown below. Revenues\nRevenues from the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants increased by 4.4% to $134.2 million in the first six months of 1994 from $128.5 million in the first six months of 1993 primarily due to new restaurant development which occurred throughout 1993 and the first six months of 1994. Comparable store sales of such restaurants which were open during all of the first six months of both 1994 and 1993 declined by 7.0% between the two periods. Menu prices were increased approximately .2% between the two periods. Management believes that several factors may have contributed to the comparable store sales decline including increased competition and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of restaurants remodeled since 1992; the impact of newly opened restaurants on comparable store sales of existing restaurants in certain markets; and an ineffective advertising campaign that was replaced with a new advertising campaign effective February 1994. Some of the factors impacting comparable store sales are believed to be negatively impacting sales volumes of newer restaurants opened since 1990. During the first six months of 1994, the average sales volume of the 70 new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants opened in 1991 through 1993 was 1.3% lower than the average sales volume of existing restaurants during the same period. Revenues from Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants were $6.2 million in the first six months of 1994 compared to $9.6 million in the first six months of 1993 due to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants on May 5, 1994."

      "7. Commitments and Contingencies: ------------------------------ There were no commitments or contingencies known to management at December 31, 1995.\n8. Related Party Transactions: --------------------------- On January 27, 1992, the Company issued its one-year note for $35,000 to Clayton Corporation, a company controlled by E.J. Huff, with interest at 8% per annum. On January 27, 1993, the not was renewed and interest paid by issuance of a note for $2,800. On January 27, 1994, an additional note for $2,800 was issued for interest which was included in accrued interest at December 31, 1993. The notes were paid in full in 1994. 9. Environmental Liabilities: -------------------------- The company's oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding environmental and ecological matters. These laws and regulations, among other things, impose liability on the Company, as a lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages, require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas and impose restrictions on the injection of liquids into subsurface aquifers that may contain groundwater. As of December 31, 1995, the Company was not aware of any environmental claims which would have a material impact upon the Company's financial position or results of operations. BLACK DOME ENERGY CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements, Continued\nDecember 31, 1995 and 1994\n10. Reverse stock split and Treasury Stock -------------------------------------- During 1994, the Company effected a reverse stock split pursuant to which one new share of the Company's Common Stock was issued in exchange for each 1,001 shares of the Company's previously outstanding Common Stock. To the extent that such reverse stock split resulted in any shareholder owning less than a single full share of the Company's common stock, the Company paid cash for each such fractional share in an amount equal to the appropriate fraction of $5.90 per whole share (which represents the fair value of a whole share after the consummation of the proposed reverse stock split as determined by the Company's Board of Directors). To the extent that the proposed reverse stock split resulted in fractional shares held by persons who owned one or more full shares of the Company's common stock after consummation of the reverse stock split, such fractional shares were rounded up or down to the nearest full share."

Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, the costs of exploring and developing new oil and natural gas reserves, the price for which such reserves can be sold, environmental concerns effecting the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as general market conditions, competition and pricing. Please refer to all of TXCO's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, copies of which are available from the Company without charge, for additional information. ITEM 3.",
      "Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves are inherently less certain than estimates of proved developed reserves. The quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures, geologic success and future oil and gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, the Company's reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore, the present value shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the Company's properties. In accordance with SEC guidelines, estimates of future net revenues from the Company's proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of gas contracts, the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. See \"Marketing\" under Item 1 of this report, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" under Item 7 of this report and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. Estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves were not filed with or included in reports to any other federal authority or agency other than the SEC during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.

    "documentation": [
      "aLF is an activated form of Lactoferrin, a naturally occurring milk protein that has been shown to prevent harmful bacteria from attaching and growing on the surface of beef. In tests conducted at California Polytechnic State University, it was shown that aLF was effective in providing a high level of protection on fresh beef products from more than thirty different strains of harmful bacteria, including E. coli 0157:H7, Salmonella, Campylobacter, radiation-resistant strains and other pathogens. aLF Ventures, LLC has an exclusive worldwide license to use aLF for food safety purposes on meat, dairy, produce and animal feed products. aLF Ventures, LLC may not be able to commercially develop aLF into a product capable of achieving future revenues. NBP has an approximately 24% interest in aLF Ventures, LLC. NBP's food safety efforts incorporate a comprehensive network of leading technology that minimizes the risks involved in beef processing. NBP's proprietary BioLogic\u00ae Food Safety System promotes the production of clean, fresh, safe, high-quality beef products. The BioLogic\u00ae Food Safety System is an integrated company philosophy that helps to establish new principles in food safety. The BioLogic\u00ae Food Safety System divides NBP's production facilities into five zones based on the potential for microbial contamination during the processing procedures that take place in each zone. Within each of the five zones, BioLogic\u00ae employs its \"Test, Track and Treat\" approach, which provides on-going testing in each of the zones, effective tracking of the results of such tests and continuous treatments throughout the facilities. The Test, Track and Treat approach includes preventative measures such as equipment sterilization, hygiene, temperature control and ongoing testing to greatly reduce contamination risks. Intellectual Property\nNBP holds a number of trademarks and domain names that it believes are material to its business and which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including National Beef\u00ae, BioLogic\u00ae, Food Safety System, Black Canyon\u00ae Angus Beef, Naturewell\u2122 Natural Beef and Leading the Way in Quality Beef\u2122.",
      "Competition exists both in the purchase of live cattle and in the sale of beef products. In addition, NBP's products compete with a number of other protein sources, including pork and poultry. NBP's principal competition arises from other beef processors, including Tyson Foods, Inc., Cargill Incorporated, Swift & Company and Smithfield Foods, Inc. The principal competitive factors in the beef processing industry are price, quality, food safety, product distribution, technological innovations and brand loyalty. NBP's ability to be an effective competitor will depend on its ability to compete on the basis of these characteristics. Some of NBP's competitors have greater financial and other resources and enjoy wider recognition for their consumer branded products. NBP cannot assure you that it will be able to compete effectively with these companies and its ability to compete could be adversely affected by its significant debt levels. The sales of beef products are subject to seasonal variations and, as a result, NBP's quarterly operating results may fluctuate. The beef industry is characterized by prices that change based on seasonal consumption patterns. The highest period of demand for NBP's products is usually the summer barbecue season. As a result of these seasonal fluctuations, NBP's operating results may vary substantially between fiscal quarters. NBP depends on the service of key individuals, the loss of which could materially harm its business. NBP's success will depend, in part, on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees. In addition, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and NBP's future success will depend on its ability to attract and retain these personnel. NBP does not have long-term employment agreements with some of its executive officers, and NBP does not maintain key-person insurance for some of its other officers, employees or members of its board of managers. NBP may not be able to negotiate the terms of renewals of any existing long-term employment agreements on terms favorable to NBP or at all."

The following discussion briefly describes events that affected those loans during 1994. In February 1994, a note receivable with a principal balance of $48,000 and secured by the operations of a fast food restaurant in Wisconsin was modified. The modified note bears interest at 8.0% per annum in the first year, increasing by 0.5% per annum each year thereafter, requires monthly payments of interest only and annual principal payments of $5,000 and matures February 1, 1999. The borrower was unable to pay the principal installment due in December 1994. The Company is evaluating its options regarding this note, but does not anticipate incurring a loss in excess of the reserve previously established. In September 1994, the Company received $30,000 in settlement of a note receivable with a principal balance of $72,000. The Company recorded no loss on the settlement in excess of the reserve previously established. In October 1994, the Company received payment in full of a third note receivable with a principal balance of $74,000.\nITEM 3.",

Over the course of 2015, we conducted operations to isolate and individually test two of the reservoir intervals with significant behind pipe pay remaining uphole. In those flow tests, the deepest reservoir interval flowed at peak daily rates of approximately 200 barrels of oil per day and was flowed on pump for six months. The second reservoir interval flowed naturally at peak daily rates in excess of 750 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 MMcf of natural gas per day.",

      "Some exploration of the various other placer gold creeks on the Chandalar property took place. Prospecting work on the hard-rock gold deposit possibilities was also accomplished. That work led to some key understandings of the geology. It also generated an internal Company memorandum by Mr. Barker proposing an exploratory diamond-core drill program of about 40 drill holes aggregating 20,000 feet. Map 4 shows the proposed lay out of the drilling, which is designed to test for large low-grade bulk mineable gold deposits. It would evaluate the degree of mineralization occurring as a large strata-bound unit nearly 5 miles in length, as explained in the report Interpretation of Exploratory Findings at Chandalar. We anticipate this proposed drilling plan would require a stand-alone (not integrated with the placer gold mine) budget of approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million dollars. Thazzik Mountain, Alaska Property\nMap 5 - Location of Chandalar and Thazzik Mountain Claim Blocks As noted above in the overview section, we staked a new and separate 25,600-acre block of 160 state mining claims known as Thazzik Mountain, located 30 miles southeast of Chandalar. Management believes the Thazzik Mountain property to be immaterial to it property holdings and operations, therefore will defer full disclosure as required by SEC Industry Guide 7 to a future filing when we have sufficiently analyzed the property and the initial samples taken to determine the standing of this property in our portfolio.

      "Independent third party professionals analyzed the 2006 hard-rock rotary drill results and the surface exploration work performed in intervening years and recommended prioritized hard-rock drill targets for the 2011 exploration season. The 2011 exploration program included a diamond-core drilling exploration program on a series of hard-rock gold targets on our Chandalar claims. These targets contain numerous gold showings and we believe they are the source areas of the alluvial gold deposits in the creek drainages. We believe we have accumulated a body of knowledge on the Chandalar claims which points us toward significant areas of interest for discovery of very large tonnages of mineralization, and our drilling program has been designed to further qualify those targets for potential commercialization. We completed our 2011 diamond core drilling campaign at Chandalar, Alaska along with a property-wide, grid-based soil sampling and a detailed airborne magnetometer survey. We completed a 25-hole, 4,404-meter (14,444-foot) exploratory program, using HQ size core, tested six prospect areas (see map below) located along a 4-km (2.5-mile) long northeast trending belt of gold showings. The drilling contractor completed the last hole on September 30, 2011. The HQ diameter diamond drill holes were generally sampled using a five-foot sample length and overall core recovery averaged greater than 90%. Six quality control samples (one blank and five standards) were inserted into each batch of 120 samples. The drill core was sawn, with half sent to the ALS Minerals sample preparation in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the samples were prepared for assay and then sent to the ALS Minerals Lab in Sparks, Nevada for analyses. Gold was analyzed by fire assay and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry finish and a four acid sample digestion with Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry method was used to analyze a full suite of elements. Samples were securely transported from the project site to the ALS Minerals preparation laboratory in Fairbanks via chartered aircraft hired by the Company."

Other Regulation\nThe Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior amended the crude oil valuation regulations in July 2004 and the natural gas valuation regulations in June 2005 for oil and natural gas produced from federal oil and natural gas leases. The principal effect of the oil regulations pertains to which published market prices are most appropriate to value crude oil not sold in an arm\u2019s-length transaction and what transportation deductions should be allowed. The principal effect of the natural gas valuation regulations pertains to the calculation of transportation deductions and changes necessitated by judicial decisions since the regulations were last amended. Seven percent of the net acres of the underlying properties, primarily located in Wyoming, involve federal leases. Neither of these changes have had a significant effect on trust distributions. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including, but not limited to, regulations and laws relating to environmental protection, occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity.

    "documentation": [
      "Ownership of the remaining 50% interest is divided between the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine, each a state entity of Uzbekistan. The joint venture produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide material from the nearby government-owned Muruntau mine, located in the Kyzylkum Desert. The gold produced by Zarafshan-Newmont is sold in international markets for U.S. dollars. Zarafshan-Newmont sold 218,100 equity ounces of gold in 2003. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan-Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 242.5 million tons of ore to Zarafshan-\nNewmont from various areas of the stockpiles designated into four different \u201cZones\u201d under the agreement. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 124.3 million tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 118.2 million tons to be delivered (8.9 million tons from Zone 3 and 109.3 million tons from Zone 4). Initially, ore from all Zones was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In May 2003, the parties amended the grade and pricing structure of the ore supply agreement with respect to ore to be delivered from Zone 4. Under the May 2003 amendment the parties have agreed to a mine plan designed to achieve an average grade of at least 0.036 ounce of gold per ton for ore from Zone 4. The amount paid for this ore is dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period in which the ore is processed. In the event the State Committee and Navoi supply ore from Zone 4 having an average grade less than 0.036 ounce per ton in a given month and the average gold price during such month is less than $320 per ounce, the price of such ore will be discounted. At certain combinations of low ore grade and at gold prices less than $320 per ounce, the computed price may result in a credit to Zarafshan-Newmont, which will be offset against free cash distributions or future ore purchase payments due to the State Committee and Navoi.",
      "In accordance with its Contract of Work, Newmont made an offer of a 3% interest in Minahasa in 2002, but received no interest in the offer due in large part, we believe, to the imminent closure of the operation. Uzbekistan\nNewmont has a 50% interest in the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture in Uzbekistan. Ownership of the remaining 50% interest is divided between the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources and Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine, each a state entity of Uzbekistan. The joint venture produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide ore from the nearby government-owned Muruntau mine, located in the Kyzylkum Desert. The gold produced by Zarafshan-Newmont is sold in international markets for U.S. dollars. Zarafshan-Newmont sold 511,600 ounces (255,800 of equity ounces) of gold in 2002. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan-Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 220 million metric tons of ore to Zarafshan-Newmont. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 98.1 million metric tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 121.9 million metric tons. Initially, ore was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In 2000, however, the ore supply agreement was amended to modify the required grades and pricing structure. Under the 2000 amendment, the grade of ore that the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to provide is dependent on the forecasted gold price as determined by the board of directors of Zarafshan-Newmont, and the price is dependent on the average gold price during the period the ore is processed. Thus, at higher gold prices, the State Committee and Navoi may deliver lower grade ore, but receive a higher price. In October 2002, the parties reached tentative agreement to further amend the ore supply agreement. Under the new amendment, the pricing terms for approximately 99.5 million metric tons of the remaining 121.9 million metric tons will be determined by a formula whereby the amount paid for ore is dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period which the ore is processed."

      "Prior operators have conducted drilling on the Maverick Springs project. In November 2002, Vista completed a 7-hole reverse circulation drill program totaling 7,020 feet on the Maverick Springs project. The program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes, stepped out 500 feet to 2,200 feet from previously identified mineralization. All seven holes encountered flat-lying mineralization, predominantly oxidized to depths of up to 900 feet. The program outlined continuous mineralization in a 2,200-foot by 1,200-foot area, immediately adjacent to known gold-silver mineralization. With additional in-fill drilling, this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material. In October 2003, Vista completed a 16-hole reverse circulation program totaling 14,015 feet, in October 2004, Vista completed a 13-hole reverse circulation program totaling 13,015 feet and in August 2006, Vista completed a 18-hole reverse circulation drill program totaling approximately 16,000 feet. In the 4th quarter of 2008, Silver Standard completed a 5-hole program totaling 5,305 feet. These results indicate the potential for bulk-mineable gold-silver mineralization. Geology\nMaverick Springs can be classified as a Carlin-type or sediment/carbonate hosted disseminated silver-gold deposit. Sediment hosted deposits are common within northern Nevada, although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver. Silver and gold mineralization at Maverick Springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch-shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit. The limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at 10-30o to the east and west. Overall, the mineralized zone is elongated in the north-south direction with a length of over 6,000 feet, a width of up to 3,000 feet, and a thickness of commonly 100-300 feet. Mineralization consists of micron-sized silver and gold with related pyrite, stibnite and arsenic sulphides.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The Company purchased Windstar Cruises in 2007, an international-flagged small luxury ship cruise line that operates a three-ship fleet that includes the 312-passenger Wind Surf, 148-passenger Wind Spirit, and 148-passenger Wind Star. The Company\u2019s 2009 Windstar Cruises schedule includes destinations in the Greek Isles, Caribbean Islands, the Americas, and Costa Rica. Windstar Cruises sails on the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, the Atlantic and the Panama Canal. \u2022The Company formerly operated Majestic America Line within the cruise segment. Majestic American Line was a domestic provider of overnight passenger cruises along inland rivers and coastal waterways of North America. In April 2008, the Company announced its intention to sell the vessels of the Majestic America Line. The Company originally owned seven U.S.-flagged cruise ships. On August 15, 2008 and on November 21, 2008, the Company surrendered possession of the Empress of the North and American Queen\u00ae, respectively, to the United States through the Department of Transportation Maritime Administration (\u201cMARAD\u201d). In November 2009 the Company sold the Queen of the West. As of December 31, 2009, two of the remaining four vessels of the Majestic America Line qualified for \u201cheld-for-sale\u201d classification. \u2022Corporate and other - This segment consists of general corporate assets and liabilities (primarily cash, cash equivalents and long-term debt), and other activities that are not directly related to our cruise operating segment. Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2009, we held cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $2.6 million and $11.3 million respectively and had a working capital deficit of $5.0 million. In 2010, as in other years, we will incur capital expenditures and costs for improvements required in the maintenance of our ships. In 2010, planned capital expenditures and dry-dock projects are expected to be approximately $7.0 million for our vessels. We have a scheduled dry-dock in April 2010 for the Wind Sprit where we expect to incur $4.5 million in refurbishments. We also have a scheduled drydock project for the Wind Star in November 2010 where we expect to incur $2.5 million in refurbishments.",
      "This transition is expected to result in efficiency gains and lower operating costs. Majestic America Line- In April 2008, we announced plans to sell and cease operating the Majestic America Line, our U.S. flagged cruise ships that sailed along the inland rivers and coastal waterways of North America at the conclusion of the 2008 sailing season. The vessels are currently in lay up status and did not operate in 2009 as we plan to exit the business in an orderly fashion. We sold one of the vessels, Queen of the West, in November 2009. As of December 31, 2009 we have four remaining vessels of Majestic American Line that we will continue marketing and disposition activities in 2010, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in the disposition of the vessels or in locating qualified buyers in a timely fashion. Travel & Events- In April 2009 we sold a significant portion of the travel and events business whereby we completed an asset sale of certain assets related to the housing portion of the business. The buyer also assumed certain liabilities related to housing. We retained the events component of the business and completed all 2009 programs as scheduled. As of December 31, 2009, we have completed all programs and exited the events business in an efficient and orderly fashion. Marine- In May 2009 we sold Marine Group to a company formed by our former chief executive officer through a stock sale for $5 million in cash proceeds. These proceeds were used to fund current operations. Re-insurance- In September 2009 we executed an assignment agreement with a third party whereby all re-insurance assets were assigned and the related liabilities were assumed by the third party. The Company recorded a $1.8 million loss on the disposition of the re-insurance business. Because the Company no longer had an obligation for potential claims under the re-insurance programs and certain programs were concluded during 2009, letters of credit used to collateralize former re-insurance obligations were cancelled, releasing cash of $5.9 million."

In connection with the Valencia Mortgage Loan, the Partnership deposited $45,000 into an escrow account (the \"Valencia Escrow Account\") with the Lender. Such amount was released to the Partnership during February 1998 after a certain environmental condition existing at the Property was shown to require no further action to the satisfaction of the State of California Environmental Protection Agency Department of Toxic Substances Contract (\"DOTSC\"). The cost of the various tests, studies, legal representation and negotiations with the DOTSC relating to the resolution of this environmental problem was approximately $71,000, all of which was accrued and expensed during 1997.

      "The other 20 stores in the Old Orchard Shopping Center are leased to tenants providing a variety of goods and services, including automotive, fast food, gourmet food, apparel, shoes, hardware, specialty gifts, bicycles, dry cleaning and hairstyling. These leases provide for annual minimum rents aggregating $806,348 and ranging from $7.24 per square foot to $27.82 per square foot (a weighted average of $15.09 per square foot). Many of the leases contain provisions pursuant to which the Partnership is entitled to participate in specified percentages of tenant's gross receipts above fixed minimum amounts and to receive reimbursement for the tenant's pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance expenses. In addition, many of the leases provide that after the lease expires the tenant may continue to occupy the space subject to the existing lease, except that annual minimum rent will increase by 25% to 50%. The following table shows selected lease expiration and vacancy information for the Valencia Property (assuming no renewals or cancellations):\nThe Valencia Property is subject to real estate taxes at the rate of 1.4649% of assessed valuation. The current assessed valuation of the Valencia Property is $8,938,000 and the total tax for 1996 on the Valencia Property is estimated at $131,000. Real estate taxes are subject to increases in the future that may result from reassessment and/or increases in the tax rate.

      "The \"Deemed Loss Events\" consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes (such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal, or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations). The Company believes the probability of such \"Events of Loss\" or \"Deemed Loss Events\" occurring is remote for the following reasons: (i) to a large extent, prevention of \"Events of Loss\" and some \"Deemed Loss Events\" is within the control of the PVNGS participants, including the Company, and the PVNGS operating agent, through the general PVNGS operational and safety oversight process and (ii) with respect to other \"Deemed Loss Events\", which would involve a significant change in current law and policy, the Company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in Congress, except as described below under \"PVNGS Liability and Insurance Matters\", or in any state legislative or regulatory body that, if adopted, would cause any such events. PVNGS Decommissioning Funding\nThe Company has a program for funding its share of decommissioning costs for PVNGS. The nuclear decommissioning funding program is invested in equities and fixed income investments in qualified and non-qualified trusts. The results of the 1998 triannual decommissioning cost study indicated that the Company's share of the PVNGS decommissioning costs excluding spent fuel disposal will be approximately $181 million (in 1998 dollars). The Company funded an additional $6.1 million, $3.9 million and $3.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, into the qualified and non-qualified trust funds. The estimated market value of the trusts at the end of 2001 was approximately $57 million. The NRC amended its rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The amended rules became effective on November 23, 1998. The NRC has indicated that the amendments respond to the potential rate deregulation in the power generating industry and NRC concerns regarding whether decommissioning funding assurance requirements will need to be modified.",
      "A renewal bill was passed by the House with unanimous consent on November 27, 2001. The House proposed a change in the annual retrospective premium limit from $10 million to $15 million per reactor per incident. Additionally, the House proposed to amend the maximum potential assessment from $88.1 million to $98.7 million per reactor per incident, taking into account effects of inflation. On March 7, 2002 the Senate approved a Price-Anderson Act amendment as a part of the overall energy bill. The Senate version is substantially the same as the Price-Anderson Act in its current form. In the event the energy bill does not pass, it is possible that the Price Anderson amendment will be passed as a stand-alone bill. In a report issued in 1998, the NRC had made a number of recommendations regarding the Price-Anderson Act, including a recommendation that Congress investigate whether the $200 million now available from the private insurance market for liability claims per reactor can be increased to keep pace with inflation. The Company cannot predict whether or not Congress will renew the Price-Anderson Act or act on the NRC's recommendations. However, if adopted, certain changes in the law could possibly trigger \"Deemed Loss Events\" under the Company's PVNGS leases, absent waiver by the lessors. Such an occurrence could require the Company to, among other things, (i) pay the lessor and the equity investor, in return for the investor's interest in PVNGS, cash in the amount as provided in the lease and (ii) assume debt obligations relating to the PVNGS lease (see \"Sale and Leaseback Transactions of PVNGS Units 1 and 2\" above). The PVNGS participants maintain \"all-risk\" (including nuclear hazards) insurance for nuclear property damage to, and decontamination of, property at PVNGS in the aggregate amount of $2.75 billion as of January 1, 2002, a substantial portion of which must be applied to stabilization and decontamination. The Company has also secured insurance against portions of the increased cost of generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from certain accidental outages of any of the three units if the outages exceed 12 weeks."

      "Expenses of operations are not expected to decrease during the next fiscal year. During fiscal 1996, the Company intends to continue to explore reasonable avenues relative to preserving and maximizing shareholder value. The recurring losses from operations sustained by the Company (primarily as the result of declining reserves, poor natural gas prices, inadequate reserve replacement and relatively high fixed costs associated with maintaining operations) raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. One of the avenues that management currently intends to explore is the voluntary liquidation of the Company during the next twelve months. In the event that the Company is unable to receive significant funding from some viable outside source or does not voluntarily liquidate substantially all of its assets during the next twelve months, it currently appears to be likely that the Company will continue to deplete its assets in order to meet its ongoing operating expenses (which will ultimately result in little or nothing being available for distribution to any of the Company's shareholders upon its eventual liquidation.) Under Colorado law the Company is not permitted to sell substantially all of its assets without first obtaining approval from a majority of its shareholders. The cost of holding such a shareholders' meeting (including printing, mailing, legal and accounting expenses) is currently estimated to be approximately $40,000. These costs will reduce the amount that would otherwise have been available for distribution to shareholders upon liquidation. Changes in Prices, Costs and Impact of Inflation - ------------------------------------------------ Current economic trends still indicate that costs of conducting business activities will not rise as rapidly as they have during the preceding inflationary years. Governmental and foreign decisions over which Management has no control could impact the prices received for the Company's oil and gas and could have a very serious effect on profits.",
      "As of December 31, 1995, the Company had bank debt obligations of $84,987 tied to an 8.5% note which matures on March 31, 1997. In addition, the Company holds a $150,000 line of credit secured with eight (8) Clark County, Kansas producing gas properties against which no sums were borrowed as of December 31, 1995. The Company currently has no commitments for capital expenditures. The Company is utilizing its own cash resources as well as outside capital to attempt to purchase additional producing oil and gas properties. In general, the Company's financial condition will not permit the risk of exploratory or development drilling activities unless outside risk capital is obtained.\nResults of Operations - --------------------- During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, oil and gas revenues decreased by $189,886 or 32% as compared to fiscal 1994, primarily as a result of lower received natural gas prices, decreases in Company net oil and gas production without reserve replacement and the sale of five (5) properties in 1994. At December 31, 1995, twenty-one wells were producing to contribute to this income. Management expects normal production decline from the presently producing wells during 1996. At December 31, 1995, the Company was operating eighteen wells as opposed to nineteen producing wells at December 31, 1994. Current markets remain unstable and it is impossible to predict how these will function. Any price increase or decrease will have a direct effect on the Company. The Company experienced a net loss of $210,598 or $2.86/share during 1995 compared to a net loss of $44,498 or $.61/share during 1994. The decrease in earnings is a direct result of significant operational/rework expenses associated with properties, significantly lower received natural gas prices, and declining production without reserve replacement. Interest income has decreased in the past few years both because of smaller amounts of invested cash and lower interest rates. General and administrative costs decreased from $266,603 in 1994 to $237,918 in 1995, primarily as a result of the elimination of one full time salaried employee during 1994."

      "A) Ohio",
      "B) Virginia",

    "documentation": [
      "A utility\u2019s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utility\u2019s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (ii) such utility\u2019s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. The rates of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCO\u2019s base rates are capped, subject to certain adjustments, at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists in Virginia. Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility\u2019s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.",
      "APCo and Wheeling Power Company are currently unable to change the current level of fuel cost recovery, though this ability could be reinstated in a future proceeding. Other Jurisdictions: The public utility subsidiaries of AEP also provide service at regulated bundled rates in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in Michigan. The following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of AEP operate:\n(1)\nRepresents the percentage of revenues from sales to retail customers from AEP utility companies operating in each state to the total AEP System revenues from sales to retail customers for the year ended December 31, 2004. (2)\nThe PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plan filed by CSPCo and OPCo that begins after the market development period and extends through December 31, 2008 during which OPCo\u2019s retail generation rates will increase 7% annually and CSPCo\u2019s retail generation rates will increase 3% annually. Distribution rates are frozen, with certain exceptions, through December 31, 2008. (3)\nRetail electric service in the ERCOT area of Texas is provided to most customers through unaffiliated REPs with TCC and TNC providing only regulated delivery services. Retail electric service in the SPP area of Texas is provided by SWEPCo and an affiliated REP. (4)\nCapped base rates pursuant to a 1999 settlement with base rate freeze extended pursuant to merger stipulation. The status of additional base and fuel clause rate caps, subject to certain conditions, is presently under discussion and there is an issue as to whether the freeze and cap extend through 2007 under an existing corporate separation stipulation agreement.

    "question": "Given the potential for conflicts of interest between USPB and NBP regarding cattle purchases, and the impact of international trade restrictions on NBP's export market, what is the most likely scenario that would result in a significant financial loss for USPB?",
    "choices": [
      "A) A decline in the value of Class A and Class B linked units due to a decrease in demand for beef products.",
      "B) The imposition of trade barriers by a major export market, leading to a decrease in NBP's revenue and subsequently impacting USPB's cattle sales.",
      "C) The restructuring of the cooperative into an LLC, resulting in a taxable event for both the cooperative and its shareholders.",
      "D) The discovery of BSE in a US dairy cow, causing a temporary closure of international borders to US beef products."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "If events were to occur which would prevent NBP from purchasing and processing the cattle supplied by USPB's owners and associates, USPB would need to exercise provisions in its agreements with both NBP and USPB's owners and associates that would permit USPB to reduce the number of cattle acquired from owners and associates and sold to NBP. While such provisions would mitigate harm to USPB, it is likely that the value of the Class A and Class B linked units and the associated delivery rights held by USPB's owners would be impaired. The other members of National Beef Packing Company, LLC do not deliver cattle to NBP for processing, creating the possibility that the interests of those other members of NBP could conflict with the interests of U.S. Premium Beef and its members. The other members of NBP do not deliver cattle to NBP for processing and marketing. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between USPB and NBP relating to cattle purchases. If a dispute were to arise, the settlement of any such dispute may not be on terms as favorable to USPB as would be expected if all of the members of NBP were involved in the delivery of cattle to NBP for processing. The restructuring of the cooperative was a taxable event for both the cooperative and its shareholders. The restructuring of the cooperative to become an LLC was a taxable event for both the cooperative and its shareholders. The tax consequences to the cooperative depended on the value of its assets and apportionment of the value among specific assets, both of which involved risks described in the following risk factors. The shareholders recognized gain or loss depending on when and how their shares in the cooperative were acquired. The amount depended on the value of the cooperative's assets, net of liabilities, and customary discounts allowed, both of which involved valuation risks described in the following risk factors. The taxable gain or loss that was recognized depended on whether the value of the Class A and Class B linked units received in the restructuring for those shares was greater or less than the tax basis in the common stock of the cooperative.",
      "In FYE 2005, exports, primarily to China, Mexico, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand accounted for approximately 7% of NBP's total net sales. NBP's international activities expose it to risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to the domestic market. One significant risk is that the international operations may be affected by tariffs, other trade protection or food safety measures and import or export licensing requirements. For example, on December 23, 2003, it was announced by the USDA that a single Holstein dairy cow was discovered in the state of Washington to have tested positive for BSE. The origin of the animal was subsequently traced to a farm in Canada. Shortly after the announcement, several countries representing a substantial share of NBP's export business closed their borders to the importation of edible beef products from the United States. Responding to the loss of export markets, live cattle prices in the United States declined by approximately 18% within 3 days. During the second quarter of FYE 2004, NBP recorded charges to earnings totaling approximately $18.8 million due to the market impacts of the closure of international borders as a result of the BSE discovery in late December. While exports of some beef products commenced once again to Mexico in April 2004, NBP cannot anticipate the duration of other continuing beef import bans or whether additional countries may impose similar restrictions. In June 2005, the USDA announced a second confirmed case of BSE in the U.S., furthering uncertainty as to whether or when additional markets may reopen, and whether or when existing markets may close. Thus far, the effect of resumed export of beef products to limited, smaller export markets has been marginal on the U.S. beef industry. Thus far, the effect of resumed export of beef products to Mexico has been marginal on the United States beef industry. Other risks associated with NBP's international activities include:\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation in the foreign countries in which NBP operates;\nexchange controls;\nchanges in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\npotentially negative consequences from changes in regulatory requirements; and\ninternational conflict, including terrorist acts, which could significantly impact NBP's financial condition and results of operations."

      "C) The complexity of the Internal Revenue Code provisions governing REIT qualification and the limited judicial and administrative interpretations available.",
      "D) The possibility that MeriStar Hospitality's income and expenses may not align perfectly with the timing of distributions and tax liabilities."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Its income will consist primarily of its share of our income and its cash flow will consist primarily of its share of distributions made by us. In addition, these provisions of our partnership agreement could in the future cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on future acquisitions, unanticipated capital expenditures or debt, which would require us to borrow funds or sell assets to fund the cost of these items. Our partnership agreement provides that unless such action or inaction has been specifically consented to by MeriStar Hospitality in writing, we will not take, or refrain from taking, any action which, in the judgment of MeriStar Hospitality, as our general partner:\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect the ability of MeriStar Hospitality to continue to qualify as a REIT, unless MeriStar Hospitality otherwise ceases to qualify as a REIT, or\n\u2022\ncould subject MeriStar Hospitality to additional income or excise taxes applicable to REITs under the Internal Revenue Code. Our partnership agreement also provides that MeriStar Hospitality, as our general partner, shall use its best efforts to cause us to make sufficient distributions to enable MeriStar Hospitality to meet the distribution requirements described above and to avoid any federal income or excise tax liability, except to the extent that such distributions would contravene the terms of any notes or other debt obligations to which we are subject in conjunction with borrowed funds. Finally, our partnership agreement generally requires us to make pro rata distributions to all holders of Common OP units, not just distributions to MeriStar Hospitality. Thus, whenever distributions are made to MeriStar Hospitality in order to satisfy the foregoing requirements, equivalent distributions must be made to other partners holding Common OP units. It is possible, however, that differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or the taxable income of MeriStar Hospitality and the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments could in the future require us to borrow funds on a short- or long-term basis to enable MeriStar Hospitality to continue to qualify as a REIT and avoid federal income taxes and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.",
      "In addition to the direct impact on us, our treatment as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would also cause MeriStar Hospitality to cease to qualify as a REIT under the Code, which would have the possible results described below. If MeriStar Hospitality fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to federal income tax at corporate rates which could adversely affect our operations and MeriStar Hospitality\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations as a guarantor of our borrowings. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. In addition, there are presently only very limited judicial and administrative interpretations of the federal tax legislation enacted in 1999 with respect to taxable REIT subsidiaries. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our or MeriStar Hospitality\u2019s control may affect MeriStar Hospitality\u2019s ability to continue to qualify as a REIT. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that holds its assets through a partnership, such as MeriStar Hospitality does. Moreover, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions might change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification. If MeriStar Hospitality fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at the applicable corporate rate. In addition, unless it was entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "We depend on our subsidiaries' and project affiliates' cash flow and our access to capital in order to service our indebtedness. The project-related debt agreements of subsidiaries and project affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends, make cash distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. These restrictions may include achieving and maintaining financial performance or debt coverage ratios, absence of events of default, or priority in payment of other current or prospective obligations. Our subsidiaries have financed some investments using non-recourse project level financing. Each non-recourse project financing is structured to be repaid out of cash flows provided by the investment. In the event of a default under a financing agreement which is not cured, the lenders would generally have rights to the related assets. In the event of foreclosure after a default, our subsidiary may lose its equity in the asset or may not be entitled to any cash that the asset may generate. Although a default under a project financing agreement will not cause a default with respect to our debt and that of our subsidiaries, it may materially affect our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness. We can give no assurances that our current and future capital structure, operating performance or financial condition will permit us to access the capital markets or to obtain other financing at the times, in the amounts and on the terms necessary or advisable for us to successfully carry out our business strategy or to service our indebtedness. -------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED --------------------------------------------\nPower Transmission Facilities May Impact Our Ability to Deliver Our Output to Customers If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver our electric energy products and grow our business may be adversely impacted. If a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues may be limited.",
      "The significant debt collateralized by the interests of the Company in each operating facility reduces the liquidity of such assets since any sale or transfer of a facility would be subject both to the lien securing the facility indebtedness and to transfer restrictions in the financing agreements. While the Company intends to utilize non-recourse or lease financing when appropriate, there can be no assurance that market conditions and other factors will permit the same limited equity investment by the Company or the same substantially non-recourse nature of financings for future facilities. In the event of a default under a financing agreement, and assuming the Company or the other equity investors in a facility are unable or choose not to cure such default within applicable cure periods, if any, the lenders or lessors would generally have rights to the facility, any related geothermal resource or natural gas reserves, related contracts and cash flows and all licenses and permits necessary to operate the facility. In the event of foreclosure after such a default, the Company might not retain any interest in such facility. The Company does not believe the existence of non-recourse or lease financing will materially affect its ability to continue to borrow funds in the future in order to finance new facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will continue to be able to obtain the financing required to develop its power facilities on terms satisfactory to the Company. The Company has from time to time guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries and other affiliates. There can be no assurance that, in respect of any financings of facilities in the future, lenders or lessors will not\nrequire the Company to guarantee the indebtedness of such future facilities, rendering the Company's general corporate funds vulnerable in the event of a default by such facility or related subsidiary. If the lenders or lessors were to require such guarantees, and the Company were unable to incur indebtedness in respect of such guarantees under the restrictions on indebtedness (including guarantees) contained in the Indentures, the Company's ability to fund new facilities could be adversely affected."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "In March 2004, Mr. Harvey and his affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with Calais which, among other things, included a more precise definition of Calais\u2019 right (which expires August 31, 2011, but can be extended for an additional ten years if AAI\u2019s right to convert the debenture is extended as well) to repurchase the interest of AAI in the Caribou prospect, including the payment of Cdn$747,728 for the reacquisition, and AAI\u2019s right to convert that debenture before it is paid. That agreement, also defined Calais\u2019 right to borrow against, enter in and upon the mineral interests in the Caribou prospect owned by AAI, construct buildings and mines on those prospects, and remove and sell minerals from Caribou for Calais\u2019 own account. The unpatented mining claims are located on federal lands and are subject to federal as well as state jurisdiction, and the requirements of the U.S. General Mining Law. Patented and unpatented claims are listed in Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report. We are engaged in the location of additional unpatented mining claims. There is no guarantee that additional federal lands will remain open to location, or that the General Mining Law will not be repealed or amended. Repeated attempts have been made in Congress over recent decades to repeal or to modify the General Mining Law. The vast majority of exploration to date on Calais\u2019 lands has taken place on patented claims. Under the General Mining Law, as amended, unpatented claims may only be validly located by the making of a discovery, within the meaning of that law, upon open lands within the exterior boundaries of the claims. Though mineralization has been encountered on some of the unpatented claims, there can be no guarantee that there is a valid discovery on any of those claims. The patenting of mining claims, done with relative ease during the period 1872-1920, is now very difficult, and most patent applications are either suspended or prohibited from being filed. Thus, there is no likelihood for the acquisition of a fee title to any of the unpatented lands, and unpatented claims now held are held subject to potentially adverse changes in laws and regulations governing them.",
      "An agreement executed in 1999 assigned a 100% interest in the right to acquire 35 claims from third parties to AAI for $0.5 million. An agreement executed in 2000 assigned a 100% interest in an additional 43 claims to AAI for $3.5 million ($1.2 million cash and $2.3 million note). Both transfers were made subject to a recorded right to redeem and re-acquire held by the Company and further subject to a note and deed of trust in the amount of $2.3 million, held by the Company. The Company has 10-years to redeem or re-acquire the properties. As discussed above, in March 2004, Mr. Harvey and his affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with Calais which, among other things, included a more precise definition of Calais\u2019 right (which expires August 31, 2011, but can be extended for an additional ten years if AAI\u2019s right to convert the debenture is extended as well) to repurchase the interest of AAI in the Caribou prospect, including the payment of Cdn$747,728 for the reacquisition, and AAI\u2019s right to convert that debenture before it is paid. AAI is delinquent on the $2.3 million note to the Company. No royalties were assigned or transferred to AAI. The settlement agreement had the effect of cancelling the $2.3 million note. In August 2003, AAI and the Company entered into deeds of trust against the Caribou property in connection with a loan for $4.5 million (the \u201cBroadway Loan\u201d) from Broadway Mortgage Corporation, Michael E. Haws, Kemp Hanley, R. Britton Colbert, Accounts Plus, Inc. and Riviera Holdings, LLC. The Broadway Loan was acquired after a series of assignments by Brigus Gold Corp. as part of the Company\u2019s debt restructuring described below. Duane Smith Trust Lease\nThe Duane Smith Trust has leased 3-patented claims to Hendricks Mining Co. The claims are the Laramie County lode, Homestead lode and Gilpin County lode, totaling 9.77ac (3.95ha). Portions of the three claims are part of the permit area. Portions of the Smith properties are traversed by the historical mine access road, this road pre-dates the location and patent of the Smith claims."

      "The gold impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the processing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process. Capital costs for mine, mill, and tailings pond construction can, depending upon the size of the operation, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation. Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million-dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting permits, to ensure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies. Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.",
      "The gold-impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Most new gold discoveries contain ores that are not suitable for heap leach processing. Often this is because the gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrite.

Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. An underground mine may have much less visual impact on the land, but the mine design is complex and requires intensive study and careful engineering. Gold processing plants often generate tailings (the residual material left behind after recovery of the gold-bearing minerals), which require permitted and engineered disposal facilities or tailings ponds.

      "D) To capitalize on the high working interests Devon holds in several producing fields in East Texas."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "During 1998 Devon began to implement this plan by acquiring significant interests in both producing coalbed methane wells and undeveloped acreage. In addition, Devon drilled 86 new coalbed methane wells. By year-end 1998, the Company had an interest in 216,000 net acres and 202 coalbed methane wells. In addition, Devon has, together with a joint-venture partner, begun construction of a 126-mile gas gathering system. The gas gathering system is expected to begin initial operations by the fourth quarter of 1999. When it is fully developed, in 2001, this system will have an estimated capacity of 450 MMcf of gas per day and access to multiple interstate pipelines. It will provide adequate capacity to transport not only Devon's natural gas production, but also third party gas. Devon's total capital investment to the project is expected to be approximately $50 million for drilling 750 net wells over the next ten years and $50 to $150 million over the next three years for the development of the gathering system and facilities. Canadian Properties\nAll of Devon's Canadian properties are located within the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a large geologic feature encompassing portions of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. This basin feature forms a wedge-shaped depression that tapers from a maximum thickness of 17,000 feet on the western and southern margins to a zero edge along the northeast. Northern Alberta Properties. This area covers northern Alberta and a portion of northeastern British Columbia. The Northern Alberta properties are primarily gas producing properties, although both gas and oil is present in multiple formations at varying depths. A large portion of this region is thick bog that can be accessed by heavy equipment only when the ground is frozen (\"winter-only access\"). Therefore drilling and workover activity must be carefully planned to occur within the winter months, typically from mid-December through mid-March.",
      "Approximately 38% of Devon\u2019s proved reserves in the Rocky Mountains are from coalbed methane. Devon began producing coalbed methane in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in the mid-1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of December 31, 2003, Devon has drilled 1,600 coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Devon\u2019s net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 88 MMcf per day as of December 31, 2003, and Devon plans to drill 110 new wells in the Powder River Basin in 2004. Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. Development of the deeper Big George formation could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the Powder River Basin. The recently approved federal Environmental Impact Statement should facilitate development of the deeper formation. Eighty-five of the wells planned in 2004 target these deeper coals. Devon\u2019s most significant conventional gas project in the Rocky Mountains region is the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field. In 2003, Devon drilled 38 wells and plans to drill another 40 wells in 2004. Devon has interests in over 200,000 acres. Devon\u2019s current net production from Washakie is approximately 81 MMcf and 1,000 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Gulf Coast\nDevon\u2019s Gulf Coast properties are located in South and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations. At December 31, 2003, the Gulf Coast accounted for approximately 10% of Devon\u2019s proved reserves. Devon\u2019s operations in South Texas have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/ Vicksburg formations. Devon has high working interests, up to 100%, in several producing fields. East Texas is an important conventional gas producing region for Devon. Carthage/ Bethany and Groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas. Wells produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates."

      "The following table lists the intercepts in each drill hole:\nNSV = no significant values found\nAll holes successfully identified altered and mineralized structures. Holes 05-01 through 05-04 extended the known ore zones of A through C east and north. It appears that drill hole 05-05 may have missed the West Cliffs vein due to thicker alluvial cover than anticipated. Hole 05-07 was the only hole that tested outside of the known mineralization. The hole intersected an opaline rich structure hosted within basalt and andesite west of any previous drilling. The structure contained sulfide minerals (mainly pyrite) and low temperature quartz, but did not contain any significant precious metal values. The cuttings were not assayed for trace elements. This structure is along strike of an interpreted fault defined by an IP geophysical survey to the north. During 2006 the Company completed a drill program consisting of 10 holes for a total of 4,805 feet which was completed in March 2007. Hole H0601 - tested altered volcanic rock on the west side of the property. This hole was angled at -45 degrees N25E to test a fault zone containing silicified and pyritic mudstone and tuff at surface. This near surface zone of alteration was encountered from surface to 45 feet. The hole passed through clay altered volcanic tuff and remained in unaltered mudstone from 140 feet to 480 feet. The last 20 feet of the drill hole from 480 to 500 feet contained unaltered latite. In other areas of the property the mudstone unit varies from 140 to 210 feet in thick. Given the angle of the drill hole and the possibility of relatively flat bedding, the true thickness of the mudstone in H0601 is probably 230 to 240 feet. This is consistent although a little thicker than the suggested thickness from elsewhere on the property. Holes H0602 to H0605 - targeted the eastern structural trend. H0602, H0602A and H0603 were step offs of the 2005 drilling efforts. This year\u2019s drill holes were drilled at steeper angles from -60o to -70o and to depths of 500 to 600 feet to provide deeper penetration of the mudstone unit in resource area \u201cA\u201d.",

This structure is along strike of an interpreted fault defined by an IP geophysical survey to the north. During 2006 the Company completed a drill program consisting of 10 holes for a total of 4,805 feet which was completed in March 2007. Hole H0601 - tested altered volcanic rock on the west side of the property. This hole was angled at -45 degrees N25E to test a fault zone containing silicified and pyritic mudstone and tuff at surface. This near surface zone of alteration was encountered from surface to 45 feet. The hole passed through clay altered volcanic tuff and remained in unaltered mudstone from 140 feet to 480 feet. The last 20 feet of the drill hole from 480 to 500 feet contained unaltered latite. In other areas of the property the mudstone unit varies from 140 to 210 feet in thick. Given the angle of the drill hole and the possibility of relatively flat bedding, the true thickness of the mudstone in H0601 is probably 230 to 240 feet. This is consistent although a little thicker than the suggested thickness from elsewhere on the property. Holes H0602 to H0605 - targeted the eastern structural trend. H0602, H0602A and H0603 were step offs of the 2005 drilling efforts. This year\u2019s drill holes were drilled at steeper angles from -60o to -70o and to depths of 500 to 600 feet to provide deeper penetration of the mudstone unit in resource area \u201cA\u201d. The holes were stepped back east from the 2005 drill holes by 100 feet. No faults were apparent in the mudstone, although the faulting projected from the 2005 drilling suggested a 60 to 65 degree dip to the east."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Currently, oil and gas prices are favorable. Historically, oil and gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are also beyond our control. These factors include:\no the level of domestic production; o the availability of imported oil and gas;\no actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;\no the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity;\no the availability of competitive fuels;\no fluctuating and seasonal demand for gas;\no conservation and the extent of governmental regulation of production;\no the effect of weather;\no foreign and domestic government relations;\no the price of domestic and imported oil and gas and\no the overall economic environment. A substantial or extended decline in oil and/or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value of our gas and oil reserves, and on our financial position, results of operations and access to capital. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is substantially dependent upon oil and gas prices. POTENTIAL INABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL RESERVES Our future success as an oil and gas producer, as is generally the case in the industry, depends upon our ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are profitable. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate additional reserves or that we will drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing proved reserves. DRILLING RISKS Our drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. We may incur significant expenditures for the identification and acquisition of properties and for the drilling and completion of wells.",
      "Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. A decline in prices could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to pay debt. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production has a significant effect on our financial results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available to pay debt, to make capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or obtain other forms of financing. Historically, prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Additionally, oil and natural gas prices may vary significantly by geographic region and have been particularly volatile in California where much of our natural gas is produced and sold. Wide fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control including:\no worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;\no weather conditions;\no the level of consumer demand;\no the price and availability of alternative fuels; o the availability of pipeline capacity;\no the price and level of foreign imports;\no domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\no the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\no political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions; and\no the overall economic environment. These factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Declines in oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue, but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and, as a result, could adversely effect both our financial condition and our oil and natural gas reserves."

(\u201cNSAI\u201d). A Copy of the summary report of NSAI with respect to our reserves as of December 31, 2015 is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. See \u201c-Preparation of Reserve Estimates\u201d for definitions of proved reserves and the technologies and economic data used in their estimation. The following table summarizes our historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. (1)\nOur historical estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure were determined using a 12-month average price for natural gas. The prices used in our reserve report yield weighted average wellhead prices, which are based on index prices and adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The index prices and the equivalent wellhead prices are shown in the table below. (i)\nIndex price of our natural gas per MMBtu was $3.67 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013. (ii) Weighted average wellhead price of our natural gas per Mcfe was $3.90 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013. (2)\nThe table below summarizes historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2013 for our 50% interest in the Marcellus joint venture:\n(3)\nPV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Our pre-tax PV-10 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $0.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that our historical standardized measure as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is approximately $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately zero and $436 million, respectively, of future income taxes."

      "A) To reduce production costs and increase profitability.",
      "B) To comply with evolving environmental regulations regarding pigment usage.",
      "C) To expand market share by catering to the diverse needs of customers across various industries.",

      "It can also strengthen the intensity of aquatic fine fiber, so as to achieve a better recycling effect of the pulp. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trademark trade secrets and administrative protections, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has three patents officially granted by State Intellectual Property Office of PRC, and there are 15 patents pending. For details, please see http://www.sipo.gov.cn/zljs/ and http://search.cnipr.com/index.jsp\nITEM 3.",
      "Based on the factors described above, Kronos expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for TiO2 during the next three to five years. However, no assurance can be given that future increases in the TiO2 industry production capacity and future average annual demand growth rates for TiO2 will conform to Kronos' expectations. If actual developments differ from Kronos' expectations, Kronos and the TiO2 industry's performances could be unfavorably affected. Research and development. Kronos' expenditures for research and development process technology and quality assurance activities were approximately $6 million in 2002, $7 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2004. Research and development activities are conducted principally at the Leverkusen, Germany facility. Such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening Kronos' competitive position by developing new pigment applications. Kronos continually seeks to improve the quality of its grades, and has been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of customers and increase product life cycle. Over the last five years, ten new grades have been added for plastics, coatings, fiber and paper laminate applications. Patents and trademarks. Patents held for products and production processes are important to Kronos and its continuing business activities. Kronos seeks patent protection for its technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe, and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties. Kronos' existing patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing, and have remaining terms ranging from one to 19 years. Kronos seeks to protect its intellectual property rights, including its patent rights, and from time to time Kronos is engaged in disputes relating to the protection and use of intellectual property relating to its products."

The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. \"Mineralized material,\" on the other hand, is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average grade of metal(s). Such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until legal and economic feasibility are concluded based upon a comprehensive evaluation of unit costs, grade, recoveries and other material factors.",

      "Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains. It is equally likely that some concentrations of heavy minerals (aside from the usual gold placers) exist within streambeds, but most are of a low grade and are relatively small. Hydrothermal\ncreation of rock with fluid at high temperatures. Igneous\nresulting from, or produced by, the action of great heat; with rocks, it could also mean formed from lava/magma; granite and basalt are igneous rocks. Intrusions\nmasses of igneous rock that, while molten, were forced into other rocks. Iron\nchemical element with the symbol Fe (Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. Like other group 8 elements, it exists in a wide range of oxidation states. Iron and iron alloys (steels) are by far the most common metals and the most common ferromagnetic materials in everyday use. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in air. Iron is the most common element in the earth, albeit the fourth most common one in the earth\u2019s crust. Khondalite\na granulite-facies metasedimentary rock. Laterite\na red hard or gravel-like soil or subsoil formed in the tropics that has been leached of soluble minerals leaving insoluble iron and aluminium oxides and hydroxides; used to make bricks and roads. Leptynite\na granulite. Lignite\na low-grade, brownish-black coal. Limestone\nAn abundant rock of marine and fresh-water sediments; primarily composed of calcite (calcium carbonate); it occurs in a variety of forms, both crystalline and amorphous. Marble\na non foliated metamorphic rock composed mostly of calcite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate. It is formed from carbonate rocks, often limestone. It is extensively used for sculpture and as a building material. Magnetite\na ferrimagnetic mineral with chemical formula Fe3O 4, one of several iron oxides and a member of the spinel group. Metamorphic\nthe mineralogical, chemical, and structural adjustment of solid rocks to physical and chemical conditions that have generally been imposed at depth below the surface zones of weathering and cementation, and that differ from the conditions under which the rocks in question originated.",
      "They are of particular interest to geologists because many granulites represent samples of the deep continental crust. Some granulites experienced decompression from deep in the Earth to shallower crustal levels at high temperature; others cooled while remaining at depth in the Earth. Graphite\none of the allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond (another carbon allotrope), graphite is an electrical conductor, a semimetal, and can be used, for instance, in the electrodes of an arc lamp. Graphite holds the distinction of being the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Gypsum\na mineral consisting of the hydrated calcium sulphate. When calcined, it forms plaster of Paris. Heavy mineral sands ore deposits a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium, titanium, thorium, tungsten, rare earth elements, the industrial minerals diamond, sapphire, garnet, and occasionally precious metals or gemstones. Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.

Settlement agreements were certified by FERC with all intervenors with an annual base rate reduction of approximately $14 million annually, (inclusive of the filed $10.1 million reduction) effective as of August 1994. On February 20, 1996, Montaup filed an application with FERC for network and point-to-point transmission service tariffs. FERC required this tariff application before granting a concurrent application of Duke/Louis Dreyfus Energy Services (New England) L.L.C. for permission to charge market based rates."

    "choices": [
      "A) The presence of a large, previously undiscovered gold deposit.",
      "B) The influence of hydrothermal alteration processes that commonly deposit both gold and silver.",
      "C) The preferential weathering of silver-bearing minerals, leading to higher silver concentrations in surface samples.",
      "D) The proximity of the property to a major silver mining operation, resulting in contamination."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "A total of 24 rock samples were submitted for analysis with the best results reporting 294 ppb gold. Most samples over 50 ppb gold were from boulder float. Elevated arsenic amounts up to 5194 ppm were returned. As with the high gold results, the majority of the elevated arsenic results are from boulder float samples. Although a large gold bearing epithermal system had been outlined in the central claim area covering approximately 20 square kilometers, gold tenors are generally very low, rarely exceeding 500 ppb. Goodall (Global Geological): 1996 - 2003\nThe Bako 1 to 16 claims were subsequently staked by Geoff Goodall, P. Geo. In 1996 to cover previously identified zones of alteration and mineralization. A prospecting program was conducted on the Bako 1 to 5 mineral claims in the spring of 2002. These claims cover eight zones of hydrothermal alteration typified by pronounced bleaching of the host felsic volcanics and are characterized by intense argillic alteration accompanied by multi-stage intense quartz veining, weak to strong silicification, and/or hydrothermal brecciation. The work program consisted of prospecting traverses and rock geochemical sampling of areas adjacent to and within previously discovered zones of alteration. A total of fifty-two rock samples were collected. A strong correlation was shown to exist between anomalous gold values and anomalous silver\nvalues. Samples with anomalous concentrations of antimony also had anomalous levels of arsenic, and mercury was weakly anomalous. Bard Ventures: 2003 - 2004 The property was optioned to Bard Ventures in late 2003 and Global Geological Services established two geophysical grids over the Discovery and Brooks Zones totaling 24.5 line kilometers. Previous mapping and sampling programs within these areas uncovered concentrations of quartz rich boulder float with grab samples indicated anomalous gold values. Regional Geology\nThe Clisbako property is located in the northern part of the Chilcotin Plateau. Specifically, it is situated in the south central part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt along an east-west trend defined by three peralkaline shield volcano complexes (Rainbow Range, Ilgachuz Range, Itcha Range) that comprise the western part of the belt.",
      "The bulk of the work has been concentrated within a 2 kilometer by 4 kilometer north trending corridor in the centre of the project area. Prior to 1989, there is no recorded work on the Clisbako Property. Eighty Eight Resources Ltd.: 1989 - 1991 In 1989, a regional reconnaissance exploration program was conducted within the Nechako Basin by Eighty Eight Resources Ltd. Epithermal quartz float collected on the property returned weakly to moderately anomalous gold, silver and arsenic values. Subsequent work traced these samples to their source and led to the discovery of several extensive areas of epithermal silicification and argillic alteration in 1990. A property consisting of 15 contiguous claims (Clisbako 1-15) covering 7,500 hectares was staked by Eighty-Eight Resources Ltd. to cover these areas. Dawson Geological Consultants Ltd. were contracted to complete a compass and flag grid covering the 4 main mineralized zones (North, Boulder, Central and South Zones). Crews collected 1,320 soil samples from grids covering the mineralized areas, and a total of 253 rock samples were collected from areas of epithermal silicification as well as from mineralized float believed to be locally derived. Geological mapping was also completed.\nMinnova Inc.: 1991- 1992 The property was subsequently optioned to Minnova Inc., and five more claims (Clisbako 16-20) were added to the property in April, 1991, following a compilation of data and re-interpretation of the 1990 field work. Minnova then proceeded to fly an airborne magnetic and electro-magnetic survey over the entire property. Grid line spacing over the pre-existing grid was tightened to 100 meters line spacing and grid lines were extended 1 kilometer to the west. The entire gridded area was geologically mapped and sampled, the results of which delineated the Gore and Pond epithermal alteration zones. A total of 18 trenches were excavated covering 5 mineralized zones (North, South, Central, Discovery and Trail Zones), all of which were mapped in detail and sampled."

These Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 8,918 upscale apartment homes to our portfolio. At December 31, 2001, the cumulative capitalized costs incurred in pursuit of the 30 Development Rights was approximately $29,800,000, net of land acquisition costs associated with nine of the Development Rights.

The Technical Report was modeled and estimated by MDA by statistical evaluation of available drill data utilizing geologic interpretations provided by Timberline. The geologic interpretations were used to constrain gold mineral domains on vertical cross sections spaced at 50- to 100-foot intervals across the extents of the Lookout Mountain mineralization. The cross sections were rectified to the mineral-domain interpretations on level plans spaced at 10-foot intervals, analyzing the modeled mineralization geostatistically to aid in the establishment of estimation parameters, and interpolating grades into a three-dimensional block model. The final drill results of the 2011 exploration program were successfully incorporated into the NI 43-101 compliant \u201cUpdated Technical Report on the Lookout Mountain Project, Eureka County, Nevada, USA\u201d issued by MDA on May 31, 2012 (\u201c2012 Technical Report\u201d). As a result of the 2011 exploration program, we successfully extended the mineralized zone at Lookout Mountain 600 feet to the south of the existing mineral deposit, and expanded mineralization along the west margin of the deposit. Results from Lookout Mountain, and from the South Adit area, significantly increased the reported mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Project. Regional exploration was also advanced in the district during 2012. Complementing previous work, geologic mapping and ground magnetic surveys undertaken during the year complete district-wide coverage. Key successes of the 2012 drill program include demonstration of strong continuity in mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Project, and initial identification of high-grade gold mineralization down-dip of the current mineralization. During the year ended September 30, 2013, we completed our exploration program initiated in 2012 at Lookout Mountain. This program focused on providing data for on-going metallurgical studies directed at characterization of gold mineralization recovery, and for initial assessment of pit-slope stabilities.",

The Technical Report was modeled and estimated by MDA by statistical evaluation of available drill data utilizing geologic interpretations provided by Timberline. The geologic interpretations were used to constrain gold mineral domains on vertical cross sections spaced at 50- to 100-foot intervals across the extents of the Lookout Mountain mineralization. The cross sections were rectified to the mineral-domain interpretations on level plans spaced at 10-foot intervals, analyzing the modeled mineralization geostatistically to aid in the establishment of estimation parameters, and interpolating grades into a three-dimensional block model. The final drill results of the 2011 exploration program were successfully incorporated into the NI 43-101 compliant \u201cUpdated Technical Report on the Lookout Mountain Project, Eureka County, Nevada, USA\u201d issued by MDA on May 31, 2012 (\u201c2012 Technical Report\u201d). As a result of the 2011 exploration program, we successfully extended the mineralized zone at Lookout Mountain 600 feet to the south of the existing mineral deposit, and expanded mineralization along the west margin of the deposit. Results from Lookout Mountain, and from the South Adit area, significantly increased the reported mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Project. Regional exploration was also advanced in the district during 2012. Complementing previous work, geologic mapping and ground magnetic surveys undertaken during the year complete district-wide coverage. Key successes of the 2012 drill program include demonstration of strong continuity in mineralization at the Lookout Mountain Project, and initial identification of high-grade gold mineralization down-dip of the current mineralization."

      "The Red Mountain Project can be accessed by using a gravel road that bisects the project from northwest to southeast. The Red Mountain Project does not contain any useable infrastructure other than a water well. Figure 6: Location of the Red Mountain Project\nHISTORY\nThe Red Mountain Project is east of and adjacent to the Rand Mining District, initially discovered in 1894. The Rand Mining District was mined off and on until just recently for gold, silver and tungsten. The majority of the mines in the area consisted of small independent operations. There is currently no commercial mining occurring on the Red Mountain Project site. GEOLOGY\nThe area surrounding the Red Mountain Project is highly mineralized with recorded production of gold, silver and tungsten. Nanominerals reviewed the Red Mountain Project, including the existing reports on work previously done by RMM. RMM has excavated over 100 test pits at the project site and has gravity concentrated the bulk samples taken from these pits. Based on a review of the existing reports and a field visit to the Red Mountain Project site, we developed an exploration program to verify the reported gold grades in RMM\u2019s studies and to test the recoverability in order to assess the economic viability of the Red Mountain Project. CURRENT EXPLORATION\nOur exploration program for the Red Mountain Project consists of a drilling and sampling program. The Red Mountain Project is not currently active.

      "Little overburden is present. Adjustments to our geotechnical-economic modelling and a comprehensive metallurgical program have enabled division of the West and East deposits into multiple geological domains based on mineralogical and processing characteristics. A better understanding of the Namakwa deposit has led to improvements in liberation and recoveries of VHM. KZN Sands, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\nOur KZN Sands integrated mining-processing operation was commissioned by Iscor Heavy Minerals, predecessor to the Mineral Sands division of Exxaro Resources Ltd, which merged with Tronox in 2012. KZN Sands operates the open-cut Fairbreeze mine, 8 km south of the coastal town of Mtunzini, the Central Processing Complex, 30 km west of Richards Bay, and bulk export facilities at the port of Richards Bay. The Fairbreeze deposit is hosted by deeply weathered \u201cBerea-type\u201d sands which are mined using a combination of track dozers and a hydraulic mining technique that was pioneered for HMS mining at our Hillendale mine, where rehabilitation is now complete. High-pressure water jets disaggregate the fine-grained sand into a slurry that is pumped to a primary wet plant to produce heavy mineral concentrate, which is hauled by truck 45 km to the Empangeni CPC for separation into commercial zircon and rutile concentrates, and ilmenite feed for the adjacent two-furnace smelter. Except for local consumption of some pig iron, all saleable products are exported from Richards Bay, including high-grade titanium feedstocks for our TiO2 pigment plants. The Fairbreeze deposit is hosted by a complex of strandline/paleo-dune couplets, about two kilometers inland from the modern coastline, forming an elongate ridge extending about 12 km south-southwesterly from the town of Mtunzini with a maximum width of about two kilometers. No overburden is present. Modern erosion has dissected the deposit into five discrete ore bodies. The Fairbreeze dune complex is part of a regional, coast-parallel corridor of terraces and dunes collectively known as the Berea Red Sands that formed along the southeastern coast of Africa from Durban to Mombasa, in response to static sea levels of the Pliocene-Pleistocene.",
      "However a significant amount of non-reserve mineralized material is included in our current LOMP, the base case of which extends to the year 2054, and US investors are cautioned that economic mineability of any non-reserve material is not assured. KZN Sands, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa\nKZN Sands is an integrated mine-mineral separation-smelting-export operation in the province of KwaZulu-Natal on South Africa\u2019s east coast, including the following key components:\n1)Fairbreeze heavy mineral mine, a new mine now in construction approximately 45 kilometers south-southwest of Richards Bay: and\n2)Central Processing Complex at Empangeni, consisting of a mineral separation plant for production of commercial rutile and zircon concentrates and ilmenite feed to two electric-arc furnaces for the production of titanium slag and pig iron. The integrated mining-processing operation now known as KZN Sands was conceived by Exxaro Mineral Sands\u2019 predecessor, Iscor Heavy Minerals (\u201cIHM\u201d), who initiated a detailed feasibility study in 1995. The mining division of Iscor was reorganized as Kumba Resources, a major equity owner of Australian mining firm Ticor (then 50% owner of the Tiwest Joint Venture in Western Australia), who acquired 40% of IHM and management control of the project in 2001 as Ticor South Africa. TSA commissioned the now-depleted Hillendale mine and integrated Empangeni Central Processing Complex in 2002-2003. The unbundling of Kumba in 2006 placed KZN Sands under empowerment mining company Exxaro Resources Ltd, and the acquisition of Exxaro\u2019s mineral sands business by Tronox in 2012 placed a 74% controlling interest of KZN Sands under Tronox. KZN Sands will utilize hydraulic mining at Fairbreeze to disaggregate the ore with high-pressure water jets and wash the slurry into a collection sump for screening of oversize. The remaining ore slurry will be pumped to a nearby PCP (\u201cwet\u201d) for gravity concentration and de-watering of the heavy mineral concentrate. At Fairbreeze, about 25 kilometers southwest of the now-depleted Hillendale mine, water recycling and other best practices will be employed to minimize environmental impacts."

      "XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that compliance with these laws will have any material adverse effect upon the unitholders. Item 3.",
      "After consultation with its state tax counsel, XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it believes the trust is not subject to these withholding requirements. However, regulations are subject to change by the various states, which could change this conclusion. Should the trust be required to withhold state taxes, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the unitholder\u2019s right to file a state tax return to claim any refund due. Other Regulation\nThe Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior amended the crude oil valuation regulations in July 2004 and the natural gas valuation regulations in June 2005 for oil and natural gas produced from federal oil and natural gas leases. The principal effect of the oil regulations pertains to which published market prices are most appropriate to value crude oil not sold in an arm\u2019s-length transaction and what transportation deductions should be allowed. The principal effect of the natural gas valuation regulations pertains to the calculation of transportation deductions and changes necessitated by judicial decisions since the regulations were last amended. Seven percent of the net acres of the underlying properties, primarily located in Wyoming, involve federal leases. Neither of these changes have had a significant effect on trust distributions. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including, but not limited to, regulations and laws relating to environmental protection, occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that compliance with these laws will have any material adverse effect upon the unitholders. Pricing and Sales Information\nA subsidiary of XTO Energy purchases most of XTO Energy\u2019s natural gas production at a monthly published index price, then sells the gas to third parties for the best available price."

      "Item 2. Properties\nProperty Overview\nOur oil and gas operations are concentrated in various North American onshore areas in the United States and Canada. We also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. As previously mentioned, we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets. Our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions. These interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region in north Texas. These assets include approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued development and growing production in the Woodford Shale, located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a capacity of 200 MMcf per day. Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This 220-mile dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal near Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline. The following sections provide additional details of our oil and gas properties, including information about proved reserves, production, wells, acreage and drilling activities.",

If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. A small portion of the unproven drilling locations may be uneconomic at current prices.

Production, Price and Cost History\nOil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities; therefore, the price that we receive for our production is largely a function of market supply and demand. Product prices are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in consumption patterns, inventory levels, global and local economic conditions, the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments, actual or threatened production and refining disruptions, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, the effects of conservation, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, refining and processing disruptions, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for our products, technological advances and regional market conditions; transportation capacity and costs in producing areas; and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. Given the volatile oil price environment, as well as our leverage, we have a hedging program to protect our cash flow and capital investment program and improve our ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facilities in case of price deterioration.",
      "However, we may not drill our identified sites at the times scheduled or at all. We view the risk profile for our exploration drilling locations as being higher than for our other drilling locations due to relatively less available geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular with respect to our prospective resource locations in unconventional reservoirs, which are in unproven geologic plays. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate.

      "In a letter appraisal report dated November 2, 1995, NDRC indicated that, based on the assumptions contained in the report, the aggregate market value of the Partnership's properties (consisting not only of the Partnership's interest but also including PSI's interest), as of September 30, 1995, was $65,600,000. NDRC's report is limited in that NDRC did not inspect the properties and relied primarily upon the income capitalization approach in arriving at its opinion. NDRC's aggregate value conclusion represents the 100% property interests, and although not valued separately, includes both the interest of the Partnership in the properties, as well as the interest of PSI, which owns a joint venture interest (ranging from about 10% to 60%) in 20 of the 22 properties. NDRC has prepared other appraisals for the General Partners and their affiliates and is expected to continue to prepare appraisals for the General Partners and their affiliates. NDRC did not conduct any environmental investigations with respect to the limited investigation of the Partnership's properties. Accordingly, NDRC's appraisal did not take into account any environmental cleanup or other costs that might be incurred in connection with a disposition of the properties. During 1995, the Partnership conducted studies on its properties to assess the levels of any potential environmental contamination. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. As Unitholders were previously informed in December 1995, based on NDRC's valuation opinion (as of September 1995), the General Partners have estimated a liquidation value per Unit of $357. This liquidation value was calculated assuming (a) the properties owned by the Partnership and PSI were sold at the values reflected in NDRC's report, (b) costs of 5% of the sales price of the properties were incurred in the sale of the properties, (c) the proceeds from the properties held jointly by the Partnership and PSI were allocated between them in accordance with the joint venture agreement and (d) the Partnership's other net assets were liquidated at their book value at September 30, 1995.",
      "The General Partners have no present intention to seek the liquidation of the Partnership because they believe that it is not an opportune time to sell mini-warehouses. Although the General Partners originally anticipated a liquidation of the Partnership in 1991-1994, since the completion of the Partnership's offering in 1986, significant changes have taken place in the financial and real estate markets that must be taken into account in considering the timing of any proposed sale or financing, including: (i) the increased construction of mini-warehouses from 1984 to 1988, which has increased competition, (ii) the general deterioration of the real estate market (resulting from a variety of factors, including changes in tax laws), which has significantly affected property values and decreased sales activities and (iii) the reduced sources of real estate financing. The Partnership engaged Lawrence R. Nicholson, MAI, a principal with the firm of Nicholson-Douglas Realty Consultants, Inc. (\"NDRC\") to perform a limited investigation and appraisal of the Partnership's property portfolio. In a letter appraisal report dated December 31, 1996, NDRC indicated that, based on the assumptions contained in the report, the aggregate market value of the Partnership's 34 properties (consisting not only of the Partnership's interest but also including PSI's interest), as of December 31, 1996, was $86,900,000 ($75,000,000 for the 32 mini-warehouses and $11,900,000 for the 2 business parks). (In January 1997, after the date of the appraisal, the Partnership transferred its business parks to AOPPLP in exchange for a 9.1% interest in AOPPLP.) NDRC's report is limited in that NDRC did not inspect the properties and relied primarily upon the income capitalization approach in arriving at its opinion. NDRC's aggregate value conclusion represents the 100% property interests, and although not valued separately, includes both the interest of the Partnership in the properties, as well as the interest of PSI, which owns a joint venture interest (ranging from about 50% to 90%) in 32 of the 34 properties."

    "question": "Given Devon's strategic focus on maximizing oil reserves and production, what was the primary rationale behind their 1994 acquisition of the Grayburg-Jackson Field and subsequent investment in infill drilling and waterflooding?",
    "choices": [
      "A) To diversify Devon's portfolio by entering a new geographic region with significant natural gas reserves.",
      "B) To capitalize on the field's existing infrastructure and established production history, while increasing reserves through enhanced recovery techniques.",
      "C) To gain control of a large undeveloped leasehold position with the potential for future exploration and development opportunities.",
      "D) To acquire a property with a high concentration of proved undeveloped locations, allowing for immediate expansion of production capacity."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "From May through year-end 1994, the first seven months Devon owned the field, production from the Grayburg-Jackson Field was 234 MBoe. This was approximately 3% of Devon's total 1994 production. For 1995, production increased to 920 MBoe as additional drilling was completed and Devon owned the field for the full year. *For 1996 production is expected to again increase as development continues.* Currently about 50% of the Grayburg-Jackson Field reserves are classified as \"proved developed.\" The remaining reserves are considered \"proved undeveloped. \"\nWorland Property. In December, 1995 Devon completed the acquisition of properties from a major oil company for approximately $50.3 million. All of the properties are located on a 25,000-acre federal unit in Big Horn and Washakie Counties, Wyoming. Of the $50.3 million purchase price, $46.3 million was allocated to 38 producing wells, 16 proved undeveloped locations and a natural gas processing plant. These acquired assets, combined with the small interest Devon previously owned, had total estimated proved reserves of 16.0 MMBoe as of year-end 1995. The remaining $4 million purchase price was allocated to undeveloped leasehold on the unit, which constitutes about 60%, or 15,500 acres, of the total acreage acquired. *In 1996 Devon expects to invest an additional $9 million to begin the exploitation of this property. Projects scheduled for 1996 include drilling development wells, optimization of the existing gas processing plant and gathering system, additional stimulation of existing wells and drilling wells to extend the productive limits of this property. *\nIn early 1996 Devon increased its working interest in the proved property to 98% through several smaller acquisitions totaling $7 million. These acquisitions also increased the Company's interest in the gas processing plant and undeveloped leases to 100%. The property consists of three separate fields located along a major geologic structure. It is the single largest gas producing feature in the Bighorn Basin.",
      "Since 1987, Devon has made four significant acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin. These acquisitions have enabled Devon to obtain prospective acreage in areas in which leasehold positions could not otherwise be established. This large and well- situated leasehold position continues to provide Devon with numerous exploration and development opportunities. Devon has also initiated enhanced oil recovery projects to further expand reserves. Devon's activity in the Permian Basin was limited in 1998 and will continue to be limited in 1999 due to low oil prices. Grayburg-Jackson Field. Devon acquired the Grayburg-Jackson Field in 1994. The property consists of approximately 8,600 acres located in the southeastern New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin. The field produces from an 800-foot thick interval of the Grayburg and San Andres formations at depths between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. The Grayburg-Jackson Field contains approximately 14% of Devon's proved oil reserves and is the Company's largest oil property. Production in this field was first established in the 1930's. However, most of the current producing wells were drilled since 1970. When Devon acquired this property in 1994, drilling by previous owners had developed the property on an average spacing of over 40 acres per well. Additional oil reserves were recovered from similar properties in the immediate vicinity by infill drilling to 20 acres per well spacing and subsequent waterflooding. Based upon analogy to these properties, Devon initiated a $75 million capital development project in 1994 that included drilling approximately 184 infill wells, converting selected producing wells to water injection wells and optimizing the existing waterflood. Devon substantially completed the infill drilling phase of the project in 1996. The majority of the field was in the initial phases of water injection by mid-1997. Completion of the waterflood facilities over the remainder of the field will require the additional conversion of about 39 producing wells to injection wells."

GQM LLC also owns six residential properties with buildings north of Silver Queen Road. GQM LLC is continuing to purchase additional land that will secure its land position in the area. Title Review\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. legal counsel completed a complete title review in 2014. This title review was done as part of the due diligence required for the Joint Venture Transaction, which closed in September 2014 and no particular title problems were identified.

Records of survey.\u201d Land surveyors must be aware of the requirements set out in Article 5 as these are essential to their surveying practice and govern their responsibilities to their clients and the State. The Company therefore decided to proceed with a Record of Survey and engaged James A. LaPuzza, PLS, MS (\u201cJim LaPuzza\u201d) in July 2011 for this task. A set of 14 maps based upon survey work done by Jim LaPuzza on Soledad Mountain between 2007 and 2010, along with supporting information on the history of staking and recording and ownership of mining claims and millsites researched by Sylvia Good, RPL, Landman and legal counsel and staff of Gresham Savage Nolan & Tilden, PC,, San Bernardino, California from the early 1990s onwards, was submitted to the Kern County Department of Engineering, Surveying and Permit Services in August 2010.

    "documentation": [
      "During the fall of 1997, one of those Red River structures was tested and the 90%-owned McCabe Farms #1-4 well was successfully completed in December 1997. This 12,000-foot well pumped initially at a rate of 86 barrels of oil per day with a like amount of water which was disappointing since such a high water cut had not been indicated on either the logs or in a drillstem test. Subsequently, a second exploratory well tested a Tyler Sand zone at about 7,000 feet which was a dry hole because the indicated channel on 3-D seismic was filled with reworked shale and lime with only limited sand. No further tests of this channel are planned. There was another test of the Tyler Sand in North Dakota when a behind pipe zone was perforated in a cased wellbore of a Mission Canyon producer which was ready for abandonment. It flowed nitrogen at a rate in excess of 2 million cubic feet per day. Unfortunately, there is no current market for a prolific nitrogen well having less than 10% methane and it will most likely be abandoned during 1999. Also, continued low crude oil prices resulted in over half of the operated wells in the Williston Basin being rendered uneconomic and have either been shut down or else are being operated only a few days of each month. Goudeau Prospect - Avoyelles and St. Landry Parishes, Louisiana - ---------------------------------------------------------------\nThis deep geo-pressured Austin Chalk prospect proved to be a very disappointing area for the industry in general and for Columbus in particular even though it only participated in one re- entry well. The Morrow #23-1H was a 15,000-foot wellbore which had been cased and abandoned several years ago by an unrelated operator when an attempted completion in a deeper horizon failed. Belco Oil & Gas, as operator of the prospect and the major interest owner, agreed to drill updip and downdip laterals of about 4,000 feet each in this cased wellbore at no expense to Columbus and its co-venturers who had originated this prospect area.",
      "While each of those two wells added materially to third quarter oil production, steadily increasing water cuts during the fourth quarter have reduced their contribution to this area's daily oil production. Following completion of the second 3-D seismic program in late spring, an exploratory Red River test well location was staked on one of several small bumps on a fairly broad closure of almost a section in size. Therefore one or more potential locations on this broad structure might be exploited now that the initial test well, the McCabe Farms #1-4 wildcat, proved to be productive. No drill stem tests were taken in one well while drilling uphole formations but a possible gas zone was encountered in a porous zone in the Mission Canyon which\nis behind pipe. Excellent porosity and oil shows were encountered in the Red River \"C\" formation, casing was set and the well was completed with 21 feet of perforations in an interval from 11,910 to 11,937. Through a 17/64ths inch choke, the 90% owned McCabe Farms #1-4 flowed oil on initial test at the rate of 135 barrels per day with a water cut of 30% and a flowing tubing pressure of 150 psi. Since this well was not finally completed until early December, it will be considered as a fiscal 1998 discovery although most of the costs were incurred as part of 1997 fiscal year capital expenditures. Immediately following this completion the 69%-owned McCabe #3-2 exploratory well was drilled to the Tyler formation at a depth of 7,200 feet but it proved to be a dry hole. While the meandering river bed seismic feature was confirmed, the cut made by river had subsequently been filled in by shale and lime with only a very limited amount of sand present as opposed to the 100 foot that had been expected.

    "question": "Given the potential for resource expansion at Sheep Mountain, what is the most significant factor that would influence the economic feasibility of restarting uranium mining operations there?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The availability of a nearby operating uranium mill.",
      "B) The historical production volume of uranium concentrates from the property.",
      "C) The current market price of uranium oxide.",
      "D) The existence of royalty interests held by third parties on a portion of the property."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "All of the uranium mining properties at Sheep Mountain are currently shut down with limited reclamation activities. Monitoring and reporting work continues to keep the permits current. There is no operating uranium mill near Sheep Mountain, but Rio Tinto owns the Sweetwater Mill (which is on standby) some 30 miles south of Sheep Mountain. The ultimate economics of mining the Sheep Mountain properties through underground working will depend on access to a mill. Over a period of at least 24 months, substantial work would be required to put the Sheep Mountain uranium mines into production, including permitting, cleaning rock and other debris from shafts and tunnels, pumping water out of the mines, extending shafts and tunnels, and further drill sampling to ascertain whether a commercially viable ore body exists on any of the properties. We have recorded reclamation liabilities for the Sheep Mountain properties (see note K to the consolidated financial statements). No historical costs from the Sheep Mountain properties are on the balance sheet of USE at December 31, 2006. Current permits are in place for standby maintenance and reclamation of the mines.\n\u00b7 Arizona\nOn August 22, 2005, the Company and UPC signed an agreement to add two more uranium projects to their joint venture (Burro Canyon in Colorado and Breccia Pipes located in Arizona). The latter project involves properties in the Arizona Strip, in northern Arizona. This property consists of 54 lode mining claims (Star and Java claims) on BLM land in Mohave and Coconino counties, Arizona. The exploration targets on these properties are known as Breccia Pipes uranium deposits. These properties were acquired by the Company pursuant to an agreement with Nu Star Exploration, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement between the Company and UPC, UPC will earn a 50% interest in the project by contributing the first $500,000 in acquisition and exploration expenses for the project (but still, UPC will have to complete its payments under the Purchase and Sale Agreement generally, to hold the 50% interest in the project).",
      "This model is well supported by hard data, and indicates excellent potential to develop new resources in the area. Several months in 2006 were spent refining the depositional model through studying historic drilling, published and in-house reports. Field mapping of the mineralized horizon has been completed. A drilling program has been developed and submitted to the BLM for permitting.\n\u00b7 Wyoming\nIn February 1988, the Company acquired from Western Nuclear, Inc. unpatented lode uranium mines, mining equipment and mineralized properties (including underground and open pit mines) at Crooks Gap in south-central Fremont County, Wyoming. The mines were operated by Western Nuclear in the 1970s. The Company mined and milled uranium ore from one of the underground Sheep Mines in 1988 and 1989. At the filing date of this Annual Report, the Company owns 286 unpatented lode mining claims (approximately 5,909 acres) and a 644 acre Wyoming State Mineral Lease on Sheep Mountain in Crooks Gap, Wyoming and adjacent areas. Production from 57 of these claims and the leases which together comprise the core Sheep Mountain properties is subject to royalty interests held by third parties ranging from 1% to 4% of the NUEXCO monthly exchange value per pound of uranium oxide (a sliding rate of 1% per pound if the price is $27.99 or less, up to 4% if the price is at or above $44.00). Additional royalties of from $0.50 per pound, to 5% of gross sales price (less haulage and development allowances) of uranium oxide, burden some of these same properties. The Sheep Mountain property reportedly produced over 17 million pounds of uranium concentrates prior to being idled by depressed market conditions in the 1980s. The Company is utilizing its extensive uranium data library of drill, mine, and property information to identify exploration targets on this property. The deeper zones have not been systematically tested nor have they been included in any historical resource estimation. Current interpretations of the historical data indicate the potential to expand mineralized areas believed to exist on the Sheep Mountain property."

      "The first 15 holes of the program targeted gold mineralization discovered in four (4) trenches, TKB005, TKB004, TKB006, and TKB009-010, spread out over an approximately 975 meter E-W distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Thirteen (13) out of the 15 holes on Zone 2 yielded significant gold intercepts, including 10 holes intersecting significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over 7 meter to 45 meter core lengths. Significant gold intercepts are presented in Table 4 below. The term \u201cppm\u201d represents \u201cpart per million\u201d where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).\n- 31 -\nMineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining, and disseminated sulphides. Mineralization discovered to date by trenching and/or drilling on Zone 2 and Zone 3 appears to be hosted by swarms of granitoid bodies, ranging from 5.5 meters to 79 meters in core length, interpreted to be emplaced along splay structures off an inferred NE-trending regional structure. Limited drilling to date traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over a 200 meter strike length and to a vertical depth of 100 meters at the Trench TKB004 Zone, including gold intercepts of: 2.11 ppm gold over 25.4 meters; 0.87 ppm gold over 15 meters and 1.28 ppm gold over 33 meters; 2.24 ppm gold over 16 meters; and 2.78 ppm gold over 15 meters in holes KBD08012, KBD08013, KBD08014, and KBD08015, respectively. Similarly, mineralization at the Trench TKB005 Zone was traced over an approximately 135 meter strike length and to a vertical depth of 76 meters in holes KBD08003 and KBD08004 and KBD08010 and KBD08011, including significant intercepts of 8.49 ppm gold over 12 meters and 4.83 ppm gold over 7 meters in holes KBD08004 and KBD08010, respectively. Limited Zone 1 scout drilling (3 holes) intersected a typical \u201cAshanti\u201d style shear zone setting developed proximal to a metavolcanic-metasediment contact with a spatially associated granitoid body. Hole KBD08017 yielded intermittent, exploration significant, anomalous gold values over a 60 meter core length, including encouraging intercepts of 1.43 ppm gold over 13.5 meters, 1.04 ppm gold over 6 meters, and 1.02 ppm gold over 8 meters.",
      "To date, a total of 35 trenches totaling approximately 2,320 m have been excavated on the Kibi gold-in-soil trend. Trenching exposed widespread occurrences of classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization in Zone 2 and 3. Mineralization is hosted by swarms of granitoid bodies interpreted to be emplaced along splay structures off an inferred NE-trending regional structure. The broadly spaced trenching encountered significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization, over trench lengths ranging from 10 meters to 45 meters, spread out over approximately 975 meter and 500 meter E-W distances in Zone 2 and 3, respectively. In addition several granitoid occurrences yielded lower grade but still exploration significant anomalous gold values. Significant gold intercepts from the 2008 trenching program, as well as significant intercepts from the 2007 Zone 2 trenching, are presented in Table 1 below. The term \u201cppm\u201d represents \u201cpart per million\u201d where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb). A total of 14 manual trenches totaling approximately 950 linear meters (TAD008-TAD021) were completed in 2008 on Zone 3 of the Kibi gold-in-soil trend, located approximately 700 meters southwest of the Phase I drilling area on Zone 2. To date saprolitic occurrences of altered granitoid exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and oxidized sulphide sites have been encountered in six (6) trenches on Zone 3.\n- 33 -\nThe Zone 3 trenching yielded two (2) significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts: 4.93 ppm gold over 45 meters, including 10.12 ppm gold over 12 meters; and 1.60 ppm gold over 18 meters, including 9.89 ppm gold over 2 meters, in trenches TAD019 and TAD016, respectively. In addition, reconnaissance trenching of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly in 2007 yielded an intercept of 1.09 ppm gold over a 10 meter trench length in trench TAD001-TAD004. The remaining three (3) mineralized granitoid occurrences yielded lower grade but exploration significant, anomalous gold values."

      "On February 2, 1993, a selective strike was commenced by the UMWA against another coal company, which strike later expanded to other coal companies. The operations of the Company's independent operating subsidiaries were not interrupted by that strike, but pursuant to an agreement (Assistance Agreement) among members of the BCOA, Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries made payments for the benefit of BCOA members that were struck. The selective strike ended and obligations in respect of such strike under the Assistance Agreement also ended on March 2, 1993, when the UMWA and BCOA agreed to extend the 1988 Wage Agreement to May 3, 1993. However, on May 18, 1993, each of Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries were struck by the UMWA. On December 16, 1993, union miners returned to work at the mines of Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries following ratification of the Wage Agreement on December 14, 1993. The Wage Agreement provides for a total wage increase of $1.30 per hour over the first three years of the contract, changes in medical coverage providing for deductibles and copayments, more flexible work rules that will permit coal production to take place 24 hours a day and seven days a week, increases in employer contributions to an education and retraining fund, and employer contributions to fund the new Labor Management Positive Change Program and the new 1993 Benefit Fund created by the Wage Agreement. The contract provisions of the Wage Agreement applicable to wages, pensions and medical benefits are fixed for the first three years of the contract, but thereafter wages and pension benefits are subject to renegotiation at the UMWA's election and certain provisions of the medical plan are subject to renegotiation at either the UMWA's or the BCOA's election. The Labor Management Positive Change Program mandated by the Wage Agreement establishes a board comprised of union and management representatives to explore methods of increasing productivity and efficiency. In connection with the Wage Agreement, the UMWA and BCOA also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding that requires that certain jobs at mines of Ashland Coal's nonunion subsidiaries be offered to UMWA miners under the following conditions.",
      "The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 generally requires each coal mine operator to secure payment of federal and state black lung benefits to its employees through insurance, bonds or contributions to a state-controlled fund. The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 also provides for the payment from a trust fund of benefits and medical expenses to employees for whom no benefits have been obtainable from their employer. This trust is financed by a tax on coal sales. The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Benefit Act) addressed two underfunded trust funds which were to provide medical benefits for certain UMWA retirees. The Benefit Act provides for the funding of medical and death benefits for certain retired members of the UMWA through premiums to be paid by assigned operators (former employers), transfers of monies from an overfunded pension trust established for the benefit of retired UMWA members, and transfers from the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund, which is funded by a federal tax on coal production. This funding arrangement commenced February 1, 1993. Some former employers have filed suits challenging the constitutionality of the Benefit Act, but the eventual outcome of such litigation is uncertain. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY\nThe Company's independent operating subsidiaries endeavor to conduct their operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry. Mingo Logan and Dal-Tex are each a party to civil proceedings as a result of alleged failures to comply with mandatory federal or state health and safety regulations. Each of these proceedings involves a fatality and could result in the imposition of civil penalties. The Company believes that any adverse result, if incurred, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity."

      "Uranium mineralization at the Anderson Project occurs exclusively in the sequence of Miocene-age lacustrine lakebed sediments. The lacustrine sediments unconformably overlie the andesitic volcanic unit over most of the Anderson Project.

Evidence suggests that deposition of the lacustrine sediments occurred in a restricted basin less than 5 km wide by 10 to 12 km long on the northern edge of an old Paleogene lake. Moving southward, these sediments inter-tongue with siltstones and sandstones. The lakebed sediments represent time-transgressive facies deposited within a narrow, probably shallow, basinal feature. This type of depositional environment exhibits complex relationships between individual facies, lensing out, vertical and horizontal gradation, and interfingering. The lake sediments include green siltstones and mudstones, white calcareous siltstones, and silty limestone or calcareous tuffaceous material. Much of this material is silicified to varying extents and was derived in part from volcanic ashes and tuffs common throughout the lakebeds. Also present in the lacustrine sequence are zones of carbonaceous siltstone and lignitic material.

      "In October 2000, Newmont and Buenaventura unitized their land holdings in northern Peru, folding them into Minera Yanacocha. The unitization increased Minera Yanacocha's land position from 100 to 535 square miles. Five open-pit mines, four leach pads, and two processing plants are in operation at Yanacocha. Gold sales for 2001 totaled 1.91 million ounces (983,100 equity ounces) at a total cash cost of $115 per ounce. Production from the La Quinua deposit commenced in the fourth quarter of 2001. By 2003, production from La Quinua is expected to reach one million ounces per year at an average total cash cost of approximately $125 per ounce. Exploration at Minera Yanacocha is focused on further definition of covered oxide deposits and deeper copper/gold sulfide systems. Additional oxide mineralization was found during 2001 at Corimayo, on the western edge of La Quinua. Bolivia\nThe Kori Kollo open pit mine is on the high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., of which Newmont has a 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Zeland Mines, S.A. Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. In 2001, the mine sold 312,300 ounces (274,800 equity ounces) of gold, while total cash costs declined 21% from 2000 to $158 per ounce.\nBrazil and Chile\nNewmont also has interests in two operating mines in Brazil and one in Chile. See the TVX Normandy discussion on page 21 below for more details. Australia\nPrior to our acquisition of Normandy , we owned a 50% interest in the Pajingo (Vera/Nancy) Mine discussed below. The remaining 50% interest in Pajingo (Vera/Nancy), and all other Australian properties described in this report, were acquired as part of our acquisition of Normandy. Kalgoorlie\nThe Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed and run by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds 50%.",
      "In 2000, Newmont and Buenaventura consolidated their land holdings in northern Peru, folding them into Yanacocha. The consolidation increased Yanacocha\u2019s land position from 100 to 535 square miles. The Yanacocha operations contain the Minas Conga deposit, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2004. Yanacocha added 8.7 million ounces of gold (4.5 million equity ounces) and 2.2 billion pounds of copper (1.1 million equity pounds) to proven and probable reserves at Minas Conga in 2004. Yanacocha has five separate open pit mines, Carachugo, San Jos\u00e9, Maqui Maqui, Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua. Reclamation and/or backfilling activities in the mining areas of Carachugo, San Jos\u00e9 and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua are still active pits. In addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads and three processing facilities. Yanacocha\u2019s gold sales for 2004 totaled 3.04 million ounces (1.56 million equity ounces). Cerro Quilish is one of the ore deposits within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004, Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region conducted a sustained blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities. Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha has reclassified 3.9 million ounces (1.98 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserves as of December 31, 2004.\nBolivia.

The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition), or ASU 2009-13, and ASU 2009-14, Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985, Software), or ASU 2009-14, ASU 2009-13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy, The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method.",
      "No. 107 for \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options. Where appropriate, we will consider separately for valuation purposes groups of employees or directors that have similar historical exercise behavior. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on its historical volatility over a period generally equivalent to the expected term of the grant. We estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and recognize expense for only those shares expected to vest. We have estimated our forfeiture rate based on our historical experience with stock-based awards that are granted and forfeited prior to vesting. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could also differ from what we have recorded in the current period. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As required under ASC 718, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, may periodically change the valuation assumptions used to value employee and director stock-based awards granted in future periods. Net Income (Loss)Per Share\nWe compute basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented. The computation of diluted loss per common share is similar to the computation of basic net income (loss) per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of options and warrants, to the extent they are dilutive, using the treasury stock method. The weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Outstanding options and warrants to purchase 6,175,002 shares and 44,550,748 shares were excluded from the computation of net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as their effect is anti-dilutive."

The claim package consists of 78 unpatented mining claims (approximately 1560 acres) that are situated along a recognizable structural zone in the Eureka-Battle Mountain mineralized gold trend.",
      "Important to note that from the geological logging of the core, the higher copper grades over significant drilled widths in Texas West appear to be controlled by the increased abundance of chalcopyrite, which is a common copper sulphide mineral, often extractable through conventional flotation methods. Representative sample material of this and other zones of the deposit have been identified and are being collected for metallurgical test work at the SGS Mineral Services site in Lakefield, Canada. Results from this study will be included with historical test work and incorporated into the planned PEA study later this year. Table 2 below displays the drill hole intersections from the Texas East Zone where this mineralization is represented by predominantly massive sulphide hosted zinc, silver, and gold mineralization. Examples of this style of mineralization are intercepts:\n\u00b78.65% Zn, 6.98 opt (218.1 g/t) Ag and 0.078 opt (2.44 g/t) Au over 11 feet (3.37 meters) in hole SM20-043 (Interval 2), and\n\u00b74.17% Zn, 6.23 opt (194.8 g/t) Ag and 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) Au over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters) in hole SM20-050. The gold grades of 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters); 0.066 opt (2.07 g/t) over 15.45 feet (4.71 meters) and 0.122 opt. (3.82 g/t) over 4.39 feet (1.34 meters) in holes SM20-050, SM20-043, and SM20-029, respectively, are of specific interest from a value potential for the Texas East Zone. These Texas East intersections represent the successful targeting and interpreted extension of mineralization below historical high-grade rib sampling in the Sonneman level from the 1980s (See Figure 1). (See Thunder Mountain Gold news release, dated; January 27, 2020). The 2020 drill program intersected mineralization extending the Texas Zone further down dip of historical drilling and the exposures in the underground development. Texas Zone mineralization is now interpreted to continue from the collar of the old Texas Shaft some 1,150 feet (350 meters) down dip to the SM20-050 intercept."

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm because we are not an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer.

Based on this evaluation, management has identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010: We did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation for the discipline and structure necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i) lack of segregation of duties over individuals responsible for certain key control activities; (ii) an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control monitoring activities, including the recognition of the risks and complexities of transactions; and (iii) an insufficient number of personnel, such as absence of permanent chief financial officer, with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience or training in the application of GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. This control environment material weakness contributed to the company not having effective controls to ensure an effective financial statement close process such that financial statements are completed and prepared in a timely manner. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements should they occur. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the control procedure may deteriorate. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management\u2019s report in this Annual Report."

Wellhead sales of domestic natural gas are not subject to regulation. Consequently, sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation, and sales. In addition, the FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation of the natural gas industry. The ultimate impact of the rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial decisions and final decisions by the FERC. New proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts.",
      "Federal Natural Gas Regulation\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \u201cFERC\u201d) is primarily responsible for federal regulation of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal governmental regulation, including regulation of transportation and storage tariffs and various other matters, by the FERC. On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.

      "While natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. FERC has promulgated regulations to implement the Energy Policy Act, including enforcement rules and new annual reporting requirements for certain sellers of natural gas. It is impossible to predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Federal Regulation of Oil\nSales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs. Under rules adopted by FERC effective January 1995, interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index, though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances. On December 19, 2007, the President signed into law the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 (PL 110-140). The EISA, among other things, prohibits market manipulation by any person in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale in contravention of such rules and regulations that the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe, directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the regulations, and establishes penalties for violations thereunder. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids facilities, sales or transportation transactions."

Data Verification\nFour different major categories or levels of data verification have been completed at Johnson Camp Mine by Cyprus Copper, Arimetco, Summo, and others in evaluating the geological, drill hole, and assay database. Each major category or level of data verification provides a measure of confidence in the database. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that taken in aggregate, all four categories provide corroboration and thus a higher degree of confidence in the data. The categories include: individual inter-company verifications; intra-company verifications; third party reviews; and reconciliations. Inter-Company Verifications\nCyprus conducted drilling and assaying with both internal and external check assay procedures for data verification. Cyprus had samples assayed at more than one external lab for both total copper and acid-soluble copper. Those external labs were reputable commercial analytical labs commonly employed by the mining and exploration industry at the time. A quality assurance quality control, or QA/QC, procedure was also in place whereby Cyprus composited sample pulps and re-submitted the composite for assay as a comparison with the average of individual assays. In addition, Cyprus did bottle roll tests on core samples to provide an additional analysis for comparison. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that, while these procedures were not done for every hole and every sample, they were done in sufficient amount to detect either errors in the analytical process or high variability in assays as a result of the geology and no significant or consistent variances were noted.

      "Seabridge completed its acquisition of the Grassy Mountain Project in April 2003, and in April 2011, signed an option agreement granting Calico the sole and exclusive right and option to earn a 100% interest in the project. During the 2011 exploration program, Calico mapped and sampled the Grassy Mountain deposit and completed three core and nine reverse circulation drill holes in the primary zone of mineralization on the property. Calico\u2019s exploration strategy was to target areas where resource expansion was most probable. Historical data was thoroughly reviewed prior to drilling, and fresh sets of cross-sections and long-sections were constructed based on existing information. New interpretations of the orientation of mineralization and geology were plotted on the new sections. The new sections were then used to select areas where in-fill drilling was needed and areas where gold mineralization was open-ended and resource expansion probable. A detailed geologic model was produced based on the results of the 2011 exploration work, and subsequent supporting geophysical surveys were completed in March, 2012. On February 5, 2013, Calico exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Grassy Mountain Project from Seabridge. A mineralized material estimate was prepared by Hardrock Consulting Inc. in November, 2014. An independent preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) was prepared in February, 2015 by MMC, which verified the mineralized material estimate and included all drill data obtained as of September 26, 2014. The PEA concluded that potential exists for the discovery of additional mineralized material at exploration target areas identified within the Grassy Mountain claim block and the current mineralized material at Grassy Mountain is sufficient to warrant continued planning and effort to explore, permit, and develop the Grassy Mountain Project. There is sufficient data to support a basic geologic model and continuing development of the project and the detailed geologic model described in the PEA, along with the results of the exploration, drilling, and geophysical surveys completed as of October 2014, are sufficient to support preparation of a Preliminary Feasibility Study.",

      "If Seabridge exercises the right to cause Calico to purchase the NPI, the Company would likely need to seek additional equity or other financing to fund the purchase, which financing may not be available to the Company on favorable terms or at all. Bishop Lease\nAn annual lease agreement for unpatented mining claims is currently in place between Calico and the Bishop Brothers. Calico is required to make annual advance royalty payments at a rate of $33,000 per year. In a mining scenario, the agreement provides for a production royalty payment base on the price of gold of 6%. Exploration History at Grassy Mountain\nThe Atlas Era\nIn 1986 Atlas Precious Metals (\u201cAtlas\u201d) acquired the Grassy Mountain property from two independent geologists, Dick Sherry and Skip Yates. Atlas recognized soil geochemistry as an important tool for locating buried hydrothermal cells at Grassy Mountain. Most of the Atlas exploration targets were identified by claim-corner (600\u2019 X 1500\u2019 grid) soil sampling anomalies. Atlas conducted detailed soil and float sampling on several anomalies and identified a genetic link between gold mineralization and silicification. Between 1986 and 1991, Atlas completed 403 drill holes totalling 221,500 feet on the Grassy Mountain property. Out of the total, 193 were vertically oriented RC holes on 75 to 100 feet centers within the Grassy Mountain resource area. The remaining drill holes were located on prospects away from the main Grassy Mountain resource area. Many of these represent future exploration targets. Atlas expanded the original claim block and collected additional geologic, mine engineering, civil engineering, and environmental baseline data to support a feasibility study, which was completed in 1990. Declining gold prices and the perception of an unfavorable permitting environment at that time discouraged Atlas from developing the project, and the property was optioned to Newmont Exploration Ltd (\u201cNewmont\u201d) in 1992. The Newmont Era\nNewmont leased the Grassy Mountain property from Atlas in September 1992 for $30 million."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "(1) In addition to the minimum annual lease payment amount, each of the leases which comprise the New Ka'u Orchards Leasehold interest also require the Partnership to pay a proportionate amount of the various expenses with respect to the leased premises as well as an additional rental payment at a variable rate tied to increases in the market price per pound of macadamia nuts. The minimum annual lease payment amounts with respect to the leases expiring in 2028 and 2029 are subject to periodic increases based on the mutual agreement of lessor and lessee in 1998 and 1999, respectively, and on each tenth anniversary thereafter or, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, as determined by appraisal. With respect to the leases expiring in 1995 and 1999, if such leases are renewed following a subdivision of such property, the minimum annual lease payment amounts will be subject to periodic increases based on the mutual agreement of the lessor and lessee after 2000 and each tenth anniversary thereafter or, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, as determined by appraisal. (2) The lease terms provide for renewal options of 36 years and 32 years for the 1995 leases and the 1999 lease, respectively, subject to completion of a preliminary County subdivision approval of such lease property prior to July 1, 1992. Mauna Loa and the Agribusiness Companies (KACI and MKACI) met this deadline and received final subdivision approval in January 1995. The lessor is now completing the documentation for the lease renewal. New Mauna Kea Orchards Tree Interest. With regard to the New Mauna Kea Orchards Tree Interest, the Partnership acquired title to the trees situated on roughly 326 tree acres (about 584 gross acres) of macadamia orchard properties but title to the land underlying such trees was retained by MKACI. At the time of the conveyance of the New Mauna Kea Orchards Tree Interest to the Partnership, the Partnership was assigned all rights under two 45-year farming leases (the \"New Mauna Kea Orchards Farming Leases\"). The New Mauna Kea Orchards Farming Leases collectively provide for the lease of an undivided interest in the land underlying the trees to which the New Mauna Kea Tree Interest relates which will permit the Partnership to conduct macadamia nut farming operations on the New Mauna Kea Orchards.",
      "Through such arrangements, the Partnership is entitled to farm, and harvest macadamia nuts from, such 327 tree acres of macadamia orchard properties. The New Ka'u Orchards Farming Lease provides for a minimum annual lease payment of $32,702 which will be subject to increase after 10, 20 and 30 years based on then current fair market lease rates. The fair market lease rate will be determined by mutual agreement\nbetween the Partnership and Ka'u Agribusiness or, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, as determined by appraisal. Whether determined by mutual agreement or appraisal, the fair market lease rate will be determined as a fair market lease rate for use of such property as macadamia orchards. In addition to the minimum annual lease payment amount, the New Ka'u Orchards Farming Lease requires the Partnership to pay various expenses with respect to the leased premises as well as an additional rental payment at a variable rate based on increases in the market price per pound of macadamia nuts. The variable rate for each of the first 10 years of such lease will equal $467 for every one cent ($0.01) by which the average annual market price of macadamia nuts exceeds seventy cents ($0.70) per pound, which rate will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as, and concurrently with, the adjustment of the minimum annual lease payment as described above. The Partnership acquired the New Ka'u Orchards Tree Interest subject to a repurchase option held by KACI. Such repurchase option grants KACI the continuing right to repurchase all or any portion of the trees relating to the New Ka'u Orchards Tree Interest, at any time after June 30, 2019 at a price equal to the then current fair market value of such trees. The fair market value of such trees at such time will be determined by mutual agreement between the Partnership and KACI or, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, as determined by appraisal. Whether determined by mutual agreement or appraisal, the fair market value of such trees will be determined according to their value as producing macadamia nut trees, assuming that the owner thereof has rights to farm and harvest such trees and has ongoing arrangements with respect to land leases, farming and nut purchases of the same type as the Partnership has immediately prior to such time.",
      "Through such arrangements, the Partnership is entitled to farm, and harvest macadamia nuts from, such 326 tree acres of macadamia orchard properties. The New Mauna Kea Orchards Farming Leases require a combined minimum annual lease payment of approximately $32,612 which will be subject to increase after 10, 20, 30 and 40 years based on then current fair market lease rates. The fair market lease rate is determined by mutual agreement between the Partnership and MKACI or, if mutual agreement cannot be obtained, as determined by appraisal. Whether determined by mutual agreement or appraisal, the fair market lease rate is determined as a fair market lease rate for use of such property as macadamia orchards. In addition to the minimum annual lease payment amount, the New Mauna Kea Orchards Farming Leases require the Partnership to pay various expenses with respect to the leased premises as well as an additional rental payment at a variable rate\nbased on increases in the market price per pound of macadamia nuts. The variable rate for each of the first 10 years of such lease will equal $465 for every one cent ($0.01) by which the average annual market price of macadamia nuts exceeds seventy cents ($0.70) per pound, which rate will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as, and concurrently with, the adjustment of the minimum annual lease payment as described above. The Partnership acquired the New Mauna Kea Orchards Tree Interest subject to a repurchase option held by MKACI. Such repurchase option, which is similar to the one provided with respect to the New Ka'u Orchards Tree Interest, grants MKACI the continuing right to repurchase all or any portion of the trees relating to the New Mauna Kea Orchards at any time after June 30, 2019 at a price equal to the then current fair market value of such trees. The fair market value of such trees at such time will be determined by the appraised value of such trees assigned to them by mutual agreement between the Partnership and MKACI or, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, as determined by appraisal."

From time to time, these companies re-estimate the cost of decommissioning and apply to FERC for increased rates in response to increased decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee has filed a decommissioning financing plan under a Maine statute which requires the establishment of a decommissioning trust fund. That statute also provides that if the trust has insufficient funds to decommission the plant, the licensee (Maine Yankee) is responsible for the deficiency and, if the licensee is unable to provide the entire amount, the \"owners\" of the licensee are jointly and severally responsible for the remainder. The definition of \"owner\" under the statute includes Montaup and may include companies affiliated with Montaup. The applicability and effect of this statute cannot be determined at this time. Montaup would seek to recover through its rates any payments that might be required (see Yankee Atomic, below). Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Unit 1. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone Unit 3 is $15.1 million in 1993 dollars, and Seabrook Unit 1 is $10.6 million in 1993 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Yankee Atomic:\nOn February 26, 1992, Yankee Atomic announced that it would permanently cease power operation of Yankee Rowe and began preparing for an orderly decommissioning of the facility. Montaup has a 7.8 MW entitlement from the plant and has a 4.5% equity ownership in Yankee Atomic with a book value of approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 1993.",

Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone 3 is $22.4 million in 1998 dollars, and Seabrook I is $14.4 million in 1998 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves.

Percentage rent is calculated based on revenues generated from guest rooms, food and beverage sales, and certain other sources, including meeting rooms and movie rentals. Base and percentage rents are paid to us monthly and any additional charges are paid to us when due. Other than certain capital expenditures for the building and improvements, which are obligations of the lessor, the leases require our TRS lessees to pay rent, all costs and expenses, franchise fees, ground rent (if applicable), property taxes and certain insurance, and all utility and other charges incurred in the operation of the hotels they lease. The leases also provide for rent reductions and abatements in the event of damage to, or destruction or a partial taking of, any hotel. All of the above mentioned transactions eliminate in consolidation. Maintenance and Modifications\nUnder each TRS lease, the TRS lessee may, at its expense, make additions, modifications or improvements to the hotel that it deems desirable and that we approve. In addition, our TRS lessees are required, at their expense, to maintain the hotels in good order and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, and to make repairs that may be necessary and appropriate to keep the hotel in good order and repair.",

Other than certain capital expenditures for the building and improvements, which are obligations of the lessor, the leases require our TRS lessees to pay rent, all costs and expenses, franchise fees, ground rent (if applicable), property taxes and certain insurance, and all utility and other charges incurred in the operation of the hotels they lease. The leases also provide for rent reductions and abatements in the event of damage to, or destruction or a partial taking of, any hotel. Maintenance and Modifications\nUnder each TRS lease, the TRS lessee may, at its expense, make additions, modifications or improvements to the hotel that it deems desirable and that we approve. In addition, our TRS lessees\nare required, at their expense, to maintain the hotels in good order and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, and to make repairs that may be necessary and appropriate to keep the hotel in good order and repair. Under the TRS lease, we are responsible for maintaining, at our cost, any underground utilities or structural elements, including exterior walls and the roof of the hotel (excluding, among other things, windows and mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems).",
      "Events of Default\nEvents of default under each of the leases include, among others: the failure by a TRS lessee to pay rent when due; the breach by a TRS lessee of a covenant, condition or term under the lease, subject to the applicable cure period; the bankruptcy or insolvency of a TRS lessee; cessation of operations by a TRS lessee of the leased hotel for more than 30 days, except as a result of damage, destruction, or a partial or complete condemnation; or the default by a TRS lessee under a franchise agreement subject to any applicable cure period. Termination of Leases on Disposition of the Hotels or Change of Control\nIn the event that we sell a hotel to a non-affiliate or a change of control occurs, we generally have the right to terminate the lease by paying the applicable TRS lessee a termination fee to be governed by the terms and conditions of the lease. Ground Leases\nAs of December 31, 2012, seven of our hotels were subject to ground leases that cover the land underlying the respective hotels: \u2022The Residence Inn Chicago Oak Brook is subject to a ground lease with an initial term that expires on March 6, 2100. During the initial term of the ground lease, the total rent is $1.56 million, which was paid in a lump sum upon commencement of the ground lease in 2001. After the initial term, we may extend the ground lease for an additional renewal term of 99 years for $1. Under certain circumstances set forth in the ground lease, we have the option to acquire the land underlying the Residence Inn Chicago Oak Brook. \u2022The Courtyard Austin Downtown/Convention Center and the Residence Inn Austin Downtown/Convention Center, which are situated on the same parcel of land, are subject to a single ground lease with a term that expires on November 14, 2100. In addition to an aggregate base annual rent of $0.4 million, we must pay annual percentage rent in the amount by which 3.25% of the total amount of rents for all guest rooms, meeting rooms or conference room exceeds total annual base rent."

    "choices": [
      "A) Hydrothermal activity driven by volcanic vents",
      "B) Sedimentary processes leading to gold accumulation in ancient riverbeds",
      "C) Metamorphic transformations resulting in gold mobilization and concentration",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "The deposit has a general N70 E elongation and a 15\u00b0 bedding plane dip to the north-northeast as a result of faulting and fault block rotation. There is an envelope of lower grade mineralization at depths of 200 to 800 feet which contains a higher-grade zone of mineralization between 500 and 750 feet below the surface. The well-defined base of higher grade mineralization from about 700 to 750 feet in depth suggests a strong pressure-temperature control on gold deposition. Sinters and breccias parallel the paleosurface present at the time of mineralization. Fractures created a stockwork pattern generally found below the sinter, though some vein extensions may extend to the surface. The stockwork is surrounded by silicified sediments. Mineralized quartz-adularia stockwork and vein types include single, banded, colliform, brecciated, and calcite-pseudomorphed veins. Visible gold (0.5 mm) has been found within the stockwork portions of the boiling horizon. The gold mostly occurs as electrum along the fracture margins or within microscopic voids. A brassy color is imparted due to the high silver content. The average silver to gold ratio at Grassy Mountain is 2.5:1. Silicification occurs both pervasively as silica flooding and as cross-cutting veins, veinlets and stockworks. The silicified envelope has plan dimensions of 3000 feet (N-S) by 2500 feet (E-W). Silicification is surrounded by barren, relatively unaltered, clay-rich (20-40% montmorillonite), tuffaceous siltstone and arkose with minor disseminated diagenetic pyrite. Many of the sinters occur as sheets instead of mounds, which suggests that they may be related to vents along faults rather than point sources. Potassic alteration occurs as adularia flooding with destruction of biotite. The adularia is extremely fine-grained and is identified microscopically or by cobaltinitrite staining. Sulfate phases identified by XRD include jarosite and alunite in several mineralized samples. Clast-supported breccias contain sub-rounded to sub-angular sand to boulder-sized clasts of silicified arkose and siltstone in a jarosite-sericite clay matrix.",

Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devon\u2019s operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 193 total wells in the Deep Basin in 2004. Deep Basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. In 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production was limited to about 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension completed in 2003 allowed Devon to increase production from this area to about 30 MMcf per day. With\nthe pipeline extension complete, Devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area. Net production from the entire Foothills region is approximately 130 MMcf of gas per day. Devon also acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay. Production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in Canada and the United States. Various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade. Devon also drills for and produces \u201ccold-flow\u201d heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet.",
      "The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devon's holdings in almost all of the important producing basins in Canada. One such area is the Deep Basin located in western Alberta, along the border with British Columbia. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin. However, other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. Furthermore, the profitability of Devon's operations is enhanced by ownership in nine major gas processing plants in the area. During 2002, Devon plans to drill about 85 wells in the Deep Basin. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels with each million cubic feet of gas. Due to the multizone nature of this area, drilling success rates are quite high, in the 70% to 90% range. Another focus area for Devon's 2002 drilling program will be the Slave Point region of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. This area includes the Hamburg/Ladyfern area where some of Canada's largest recent gas discoveries have occurred. Devon plans to drill eight Slave Point wells in 2002, including five at Ladyfern. Near the end of 2002, Devon plans to bring several previous deep gas discoveries on stream in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills of northeastern British Columbia. Since its initial discovery here in 1998, Devon has drilled 11 successful wells. Devon expects to commence initial production at a combined rate of about 50 million cubic feet of gas per day to Devon. The Anderson acquisition significantly increased Devon's holdings in the Foothills. Devon has interests ranging from 49% to 55% in over 1.2 million gross acres in the area. While Devon had focused on exploring for deep gas reservoirs in this area, Anderson had achieved considerable success in drilling for shallower formations. The Anderson acquisition affords the Company the opportunity to extend Anderson's shallow gas development onto Devon's acreage and to apply Devon's deep gas exploration expertise to the Anderson acreage.",
      "In 2002, Devon entered into a four-well joint venture with ChevronTexaco that will earn Devon a 25% working interest in 71 deepwater blocks and 14 identified exploratory prospects. Devon also made a potentially significant discovery in 2002 in 8,200 feet of water at Cascade located in Walker Ridge Block 206 and plans to participate with other partners in four or five deepwater wells in 2003, including a confirmation well at Cascade. Devon's operations in the Gulf Coast region include operations onshore in South Texas, where exploration for oil and gas is accelerating. Devon's activities in this area have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/Vicksburg formations. Devon also acquired additional production and undeveloped acreage in the South Texas area from its acquisition of Mitchell. CANADA\nDevon's acquisition of Anderson in late 2001 significantly increased the relative importance of Devon's Canadian operations. The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devon's holdings in the Deep Basin located in Western Alberta and Eastern British Columbia, and the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. As of December 31, 2002, 36% of Devon's proved reserves were in Canada. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devon's operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 100 wells in the Deep Basin in 2003. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. Late in 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production has been limited to 10 MMcf of gas per day."

      "If we fail to meet a future compliance measure, the availability of funds under our credit facility might be restricted. The credit agreement limits our ability to effect mergers, asset sales and change of control events, and limits dividends. The credit agreement also contains a cross-default provision, which would be triggered by a default or acceleration of $50 million or more of indebtedness secured by our assets or $5 million or more of any other indebtedness. Because we were not in compliance with the leverage covenant under the credit agreement as of March 10, 2003, we could not borrow under the credit agreement and do not expect to be able to do so in the future unless we amend or replace our credit facility, or use the proceeds from any future asset sales to reduce our leverage.

(2)\nRepresents rent for the year ended December 31, 2011. Rent will increase annually by 5.5%. (3)\nThe ground lease term is 49 years. We have the right to renew the ground lease for an additional 49 year term on the same terms then applicable to the ground lease. (4)\nThe total annual rent includes the fixed rent noted in the table plus a percentage rent equal to 5% of gross receipts for each lease year, but only to the extent that 5% of gross receipts exceeds the minimum fixed rent in such lease year. There was no such percentage rent earned during the year ended December 31, 2011. (5)\nWe own a 21% interest in the land underlying the hotel and, as a result, 21% of the annual rent under the ground lease is paid to us by the hotel. (6)\nTotal annual rent under the ground lease is capped at 2.5% of hotel gross revenues during the initial 30 years of the ground lease."

BOND FINANCING\nThe interest rates on approximately $233.9 million of the Company's total variable rate bond financing as of December 31, 1997 are determined weekly by a remarketing agent to equal the minimum interest rate necessary for the bonds to be remarketed at par. While these bonds are remarketed at variable rates, the Company has entered into interest rate protection agreements to protect itself against increases in interest rates (See \"Interest Rate Protection\"). Each issue of variable rate bonds is secured by a letter of credit or similar instrument (referred to as \"credit enhancement\") issued by a bank or other financial institution (a \"credit enhancer\"). The purpose of the credit enhancement is to secure the borrower's obligation to pay principal and interest on the bonds and to permit the bonds to receive an investment-grade rating, thereby lowering the Company's interest costs from those of an unrated debt instrument. If a credit enhancer advances money under its credit enhancement commitment to pay principal and interest on the bonds, the related Property Partnership will be obligated to reimburse the credit enhancer, which obligation generally will be secured by a mortgage on the related property. If the Property Partnership fails to so reimburse a credit enhancer, the credit enhancer may foreclose on the Property that secures that reimbursement obligation. Each credit enhancement agreement terminates on a specified date that is at or prior to the maturity date of the related bonds.

      "Due to the significant number of individual deeds, leases and similar instruments involved in the acquisition and development of the Royalty Properties by us or our predecessors, acreage amounts are subject to change as new information becomes available. In addition, as a royalty owner, our access to information concerning activity and operations on the Royalty Properties is limited. Most of our producing properties are subject to old leases and other contracts pursuant to which we are not entitled to well information. Some of our newer leases provide for access to technical data and other information. We may have limited access to public data in some areas through third party subscription services. Consequently, the exact number of wells producing from, or drilling on the Royalty Properties is not determinable. The primary manner by which we will become aware of activity on the Royalty Properties is the receipt of division orders or other correspondence from operators or purchasers. Acreage Summary\nThe following table sets forth as of December 31, 2005 a summary of our gross and net, where applicable, acres of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests, and a compilation of the number of counties and parishes and states in which these interests are located. The majority of our net mineral acres are unleased. Acreage amounts may not add across due to overlapping ownership among categories. Our net interest in production from royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests is based on lease royalty and other third party contractual terms which vary from property to property.

    "question": "Given Montaup's financial involvement in both Millstone 3 and Connecticut Yankee, what is the most accurate assessment of the potential financial impact on Montaup stemming from regulatory actions and legal proceedings related to these nuclear power plants?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Montaup's financial exposure is limited to its share of decommissioning costs for both plants, which are currently recoverable through rates.",
      "B) Montaup faces significant financial risk due to potential liabilities associated with operating expenses incurred during the Millstone 3 outage and the closure of Connecticut Yankee.",
      "C) While Montaup has made payments for Millstone 3's O&M expenses during the outage, these payments do not constitute an admission of financial responsibility and the ultimate impact on Montaup remains uncertain.",
      "D) Montaup's financial exposure is negligible as its ownership stakes in both plants are relatively small and the NRC has not imposed any direct financial penalties on Montaup."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone 3 and Seabrook I. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone 3 is $21.9 million in 1997 dollars, and Seabrook I is $13.7 million in 1997 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Millstone 3:\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone 3, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Subsidiaries of Northeast are the lead participants in Millstone 3. On March 30, 1996, it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone 3 and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee. (See \"Connecticut Yankee\" below.) In October 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it was establishing a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office is responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an Independent Corrective Action Verification Program (ICAVP), (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities. Also, the NRC directed Northeast to submit a plan for disposition of safety issues raised by employees and retain an independent third-party to oversee implementation of this plan.",
      "CL&P and WMECO, owners of approximately 65% of Millstone 3, are Northeast subsidiaries that agreed to be responsible for the proper operation of the unit. The non-operating owners of Millstone 3 claim that Northeast and its subsidiaries failed to comply with NRC regulations, failed to operate the facility in accordance with good utility operating practice and attempted to conceal their activities from the non-operating owners and the NRC. The arbitration and lawsuits seek to recover costs associated with replacement power and O&M costs resulting from the shutdown of Millstone 3. The non- operating owners conservatively estimate that their losses will exceed $200 million. Montaup's share of this estimate is approximately $8.0 million. In December 1997, Northeast filed a motion to dismiss the non-operating owners' claims, or alternatively to stay the pending lawsuit until after resolution of the arbitration case. These requests were denied in July 1998. Montaup paid its share of Millstone 3's O&M expenses during the prolonged outage on a reservation of right basis. The fact that Montaup made payment for these expenses is not an admission of financial responsibility for expenses incurred during the outage. EUA cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the NRC inquiries or legal proceedings brought against CL&P, WMECO and Northeast or the impact which they may have on Montaup and the EUA system. Connecticut Yankee:\nConnecticut Yankee, a 582-mw nuclear unit, was taken off-line in July 1996 because of issues related to certain containment air recirculation and service water systems. Montaup has a 4.5% equity ownership in Connecticut Yankee. In October 1996, Montaup, as one of the joint owners, participated in an economic evaluation of Connecticut Yankee which recommended permanently closing the unit and replacing its output with less expensive energy sources. In December 1996, the Board of Directors of Connecticut Yankee voted to retire the generating station. Connecticut Yankee certified to the NRC that it had permanently closed power generation operations and removed fuel from the reactor.",
      "Montaup's share of the total estimated costs is $34.1 million. Recent NRC Actions:\nMillstone III\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone III, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Northeast is the lead participant in Millstone III, and on March 30, 1996, Northeast determined it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The NRC has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone III and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee (see \"Connecticut Yankee\" above). In July 1996 Northeast reported that it has been responding to a series of requests from the NRC seeking assurance that the Millstone III unit will be operated in accordance with the terms of its operating license and other NRC requirements and regulations and dealing with a series of issues that Northeast has identified in the course of these reviews. Providing these assurances and addressing these issues will be components of an Operational Readiness Plan (ORP) to be developed for the Millstone III unit. The ORP for Millstone III was submitted to the NRC on July 2, 1996 and is presently being implemented. On October 18 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it will establish a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office will be responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an independent corrective action verification program; (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities."

      "A) AEP System companies face minimal risk as RCRA currently excludes oil and gas wastes from hazardous classification.",
      "B) The primary risk lies in potential fines for non-compliance with state environmental laws, which are less stringent than federal regulations.",
      "C) AEP System companies could face substantial clean-up costs under CERCLA for existing sites, even if they were not directly responsible for the contamination.",
      "D) The most significant risk is the potential for increased compliance costs associated with managing hazardous waste under RCRA, coupled with potential liability for damages resulting from spills under OPA '90."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "OPA imposes substantial penalties for failure to comply. AEP companies with oil handling and storage facilities meeting the OPA criteria have in place required response plans, training and drill programs. Solid and Hazardous Waste\nSection 311 of the Clean Water Act imposes substantial penalties for spills of Federal EPA-listed hazardous substances into water and for failure to report such spills. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) expanded the reporting requirements to cover the release of hazardous substances generally into the environment, including water, land and air. AEP's subsidiaries store and use some of these hazardous substances, including PCBs contained in certain capacitors and transformers, but the occurrence and ramifications of a spill or release of such substances cannot be predicted. CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws provide governmental agencies with the authority to require clean-up of hazardous waste sites and releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek compensation for damages to natural resources. Since liability under CERCLA is strict, joint and several, and can be applied retroactively, AEP System companies which previously disposed of PCB-containing electrical equipment and other hazardous substances may be required to participate in remedial activities at such disposal sites should environmental problems result. OPCo is the only AEP System company which is a defendant in a cost-recovery lawsuit related to clean-up liability at a Federal EPA-identified CERCLA site. OPCo settled its alleged liability at this site under terms of a consent decree and is awaiting formal dismissal from the case. AEP System companies are identified as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) for four additional federal sites, including CSPCo at two sites and I&M at two sites. Management's present estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs for identified sites for which AEP subsidiaries have been declared PRPs or are defendants in CERCLA cost recovery litigation.",
      "Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation, storage, transfer, and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA, however, excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes \u201cdrilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, gas, or geothermal energy.\u201d Because of this exclusion, many of our operations are exempt from RCRA regulation. Nevertheless, we must comply with RCRA regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the RCRA exclusion. The OPA \u201890 and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. OPA \u201890 establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d While OPA \u201890 liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water, at least one district court has held that OPA \u201890 liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters. Stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future, such as proposals made in Congress and at the state level from time to time, that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as \u201chazardous wastes\u201d and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal, and clean-up requirements.",
      "In order to comply with these statutes and regulations, the leaseholders of the oil and gas properties in which we hold working interests were required to obtain permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties being imposed upon the leaseholders, which in turn could negatively affect our profitability. Environmental Regulations\nThe drilling and production operations of oil and gas properties are affected by various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act. The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal of \u201chazardous substances\u201d found at such sites. It is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of \u201csolid waste\u201d and \u201chazardous waste\u201d and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of \u201chazardous substance,\u201d state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as \u201cnon-hazardous,\u201d such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. Generally, environmental laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment or the disposal of waste materials, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment."

We own an additional approximately 45 square miles of exploration property located adjacent to the current Casa Berardi mine and comprised of approximately 230 claims, most of which are subject to a 1% NSR royalty in favor of Lake Shore Gold Corp.\nWe also hold a non-exclusive lease BNE 25938 for a sand and gravel pit, tailings lease 70218, and an additional 12 acres of land contiguous to mining lease BM 768 for rock waste material storage. Under the Quebec Mining Act, claims are required to be renewed every two years. Statutorily prescribed minimum work commitments apply to all claims and leases. As of December 31, 2018, the claims and leases comprising part of the Casa Berardi mine have excess work credits of CAD$10.7 million. Claims and leases for our other projects in Quebec have excess work credits of CAD$35.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The project consists of an underground mine and the East Mine Crown Pillar open pit mine."

    "question": "Considering the regulatory landscape and the projected timeline for permanent nuclear waste disposal, what is the most likely scenario for BGE's long-term spent fuel management strategy?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Relying solely on on-site storage capacity until the Yucca Mountain Repository becomes operational.",
      "B) Utilizing a combination of on-site storage, interim off-site disposal, and potentially plant modifications to accommodate future storage needs.",
      "C) Negotiating long-term contracts with private waste disposal companies to manage spent fuel until a permanent solution is available.",
      "D) Actively lobbying for expedited development of the Yucca Mountain Repository to ensure timely disposal of spent fuel."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "BGE has received a license from the NRC to operate its on-site independent spent fuel storage facility. BGE now has storage capacity at Calvert Cliffs that will accommodate spent fuel from operations through the year 2006. In addition, BGE can expand its temporary storage capacity to meet future requirements until federal storage is available. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the 1992 Act) contains provisions requiring domestic utilities to contribute to a fund for decommissioning and decontaminating the Department of Energy's (DOE) uranium enrichment facilities. These contributions are generally payable over a fifteen-year period with escalation for inflation and are based upon the amount of uranium enriched by DOE for each utility through 1992. The 1992 Act provides that these costs are recoverable through utility service rates as a cost of fuel. Information about the cost of decommissioning is discussed in NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS on page 42 under the heading \"UTILITY PLANT, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND DECOMMISSIONING.\" GAS: BGE has a firm natural gas transportation entitlement of 3,500 dekatherms a day to provide ignition and banking at certain power plants. Gas for electric generation is purchased as needed in the spot market using interruptible transportation arrangements. Certain gas fired units can use residual fuel oil as an alternative. GAS BUSINESS GAS REGULATORY MATTERS AND COMPETITION Regulatory changes in the natural gas business are well under way. In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 636, which unbundled gas-service elements. This gave gas users the ability to choose various gas purchasing, transportation, brokering, and storage options. Prior to Order 636, BGE purchased gas, transportation and storage services primarily from pipeline companies. Now, BGE and other local distribution companies buy gas directly from various suppliers and arrange separately for transportation and storage. BGE's large gas customers are arranging for their own gas supplies and are contracting with BGE for transportation.",
      "The Energy Policy Act has provisions for the recovery of a portion of the costs associated with the decommissioning and decontamination of the gaseous diffusion plants used in the enrichment process. These costs are being recovered on the basis of enrichment services purchased by utilities from the DOE prior to October of 1992. The total annual assessment for all domestic utilities is limited to $150 million per federal fiscal year and assessable until October 2007. The STP assessment will be approximately $2.0 million each year with CPL's share being 25.2% of the annual STP assessment. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires the DOE to develop a permanent high level waste disposal facility for the storage of spent nuclear fuel by 1998. The DOE last estimated that the permanent facility will be available in 2010. The DOE will take possession of all spent fuel generated at STP as a result of a contract CPL and other STP participants have entered into with the DOE. STP has on-site storage facilities with the capability to store all the spent nuclear fuel generated by the STP units over their lives. Therefore, the DOE delay in providing the disposal facility will not impact the operation of the STP units. Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1992, a one-mill per KWH assessment on electricity generated and sold from nuclear reactors funds the DOE waste disposal program. Risks of substantial liability could arise from the operation of STP and from the use, handling, disposal and possible radioactive emissions associated with nuclear fuel. While CPL carries insurance, the availability, amount and coverage thereof is limited and may become more limited in the future. The available insurance may not cover all types or amounts of loss or expense which may be experienced in connection with the ownership of STP. See ITEM 8 - NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for information relating to nuclear insurance. Governmental Regulation The price and availability of each of the foregoing fuel types are significantly affected by governmental regulation.",
      "With the plant modifications completed in 2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its current operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted, additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric utilities. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. The approval by President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing phase. Based on the DOE schedule published in the July 1999 Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start receiving spent fuel in 2010. The Repository is expected to be delayed further as the result of an announced delay in submission of the license application. The Companies intend to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as a contingency for further delays with the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for disposal past 2010. System Capacity and Reserves\nThe 2004 net maximum hourly demand for each of the Companies was: OE-5,461 MW (including an additional 273 MW of firm power sales under a contract which extends through 2005) on June 9, 2004; Penn-987 MW (including an additional 56 MW of firm power sales under a contract which extends through 2005) on June 15, 2004; CEI-4,126 MW on August 27, 2004; TE-2,032 MW on August 3, 2004; JCP&L-5,457 MW on August 20, 2004; Met-Ed-2,548 MW on August 3, 2004; and Penelec-2,830 MW on December 20, 2004."

Applications may be approved subject to conditions that govern exercise of the water rights. Appeals from decisions of the State Engineer are to the district court of the county in which the work or point of desired appropriation is situated and from there to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Finally, jurisdiction over water rights may become an issue in New Mexico when an Indian nation, such as the Navajo Nation, objects to the State Engineer's authority to grant or transfer a water right or to award a temporary water right, claiming tribal jurisdiction over Indian country. This issue could result in litigation between the Indian nation and the state which may delay action on water right applications, and, depending on who prevails as to any particular property, could result in a requirement to make applications to the appropriate Indian nation and continuing jurisdiction by the Indian nation over use of the water. All of the foregoing issues arise to a greater or lesser extent in connection with the Company's New Mexico properties. There can be no assurance that the regulatory permits or licenses in Texas or New Mexico, or the applications for water rights in New Mexico, required for any project of the Company will be approved by the necessary governing authority in the form contemplated by management, or in any other form, or within the time periods necessary to commence timely production.",

      "The Company originally acquired mineral leases on Sections 8 and 17 from United Nuclear Corporation (\"UNC\") and, in connection therewith, acquired certain rights to use water from UNC. An application to use one of these rights has been the subject of extensive administrative proceedings and litigation with the New Mexico State Engineer and the Navajo Nation over the nature and extent of UNC's water rights. The State Engineer determined that the consumptive use and diversion amount UNC originally sought to transfer for use by the Company were in excess of the rights held by UNC and denied the application on the grounds that the UNC rights were insufficient to support the Company's mining operations. The Company has since revised its water budget to be consistent with the rights of UNC as determined by the State Engineer. The State Engineer has agreed to hear a revised application for the transfer of the water rights within 180 days after the application is submitted. The Company anticipates filing a revised application or applications for new temporary appropriation of water. A claim by the Navajo Nation to jurisdiction over these water rights was denied by the State Engineer and the state district court. These decisions do not preclude such a claim from being made in federal court. Permitting Status. On June 21, 1989 the EPA issued its aquifer exemption covering that portion of the Churchrock site known as Section 8, and on November 1, 1989, NMED issued its permit, covering UIC activities on Section 8. On October 7, 1994, NMED issued an amended permit covering UIC activities on both Section 8 and Section 17. The permit for Section 17 was contested by the Navajo Nation which claimed UIC regulatory jurisdiction over the site, based on the fact that the surface estate is owned by the Navajo Nation. The EPA, acting as an advocate for the Navajo Nation, has asserted the Navajo Nation's claim and has refused to amend its previously issued aquifer exemption covering Section 8 to add the portion of the Churchrock facility on Section 17."

As well, Access is obligated to pay a 5% gross overriding royalty to LLCDA from the production of any Products. The Company is committed, under the Unanimous Shareholders\u2019 Agreement among Access, the Company and the minority shareholder, to contribute sufficient capital to Access to meet Access\u2019s planned financial commitments until such time as Access has sufficient internal capital resources to fund its commitments without such contributions. These contributions are treated as a contribution of capital, with no increase in our current 75% equity participation in Access. Therefore, all contributions that we make to Access are dilutive to our shareholders as to 25% of such contributions.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Property Costs\nOn April 30, 2009, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved an agreement in principle to sell two-thirds of its interest in Access Energy to the other stockholder of Access Energy, Mr. Reg Burden. The sale is subject to Blacksands\u2019 stockholder approval at the next annual general meeting.

The Company expects to close the sale of the Access shares, subject to completion of documentation and receipt of Blacksands\u2019 shareholder approval, as soon as practicable following the Blacksands\u2019 shareholder meeting. 3.\nOIL AND GAS PROPERTY COSTS (continued)\nManagement assessed the impact of the April 30, 2009 announcement on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operation, and determined that the Company\u2019s oil and gas property costs capitalized had been impaired requiring a write-down to the fair value of the asset ($nil) and accordingly, these capitalized costs were written down to $nil during the second quarter ended April 30, 2009. The fair value of the asset was determined with reference to the value of the monetary consideration for the proposed transaction for two-thirds of its 75% interest in Access as $1. To the extent that any costs incurred for Access projects would otherwise be capitalized as oil and gas property costs when they are incurred, such costs will be expensed by the Company."

      "A) To increase competition within the natural gas industry by requiring pipelines to offer open access to their transportation services.",

      "C) To address concerns about the environmental impact of natural gas transportation by promoting the use of renewable energy sources.",
      "D) To streamline the process of interstate natural gas transportation by consolidating multiple pipeline companies into a single entity."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Commencing in 1992, FERC issued Orders Nos. 636, 636-A, 636-B and 636-C (collectively, \"Order No. 636\"), which generally opened access to interstate gas pipelines by requiring such pipelines to \"unbundle\" their transportation services and allow shippers to choose and pay for only the services they require, regardless of whether the shipper purchases gas from such pipelines or from other suppliers. These orders also require upstream pipelines to permit downstream pipelines to assign upstream capacity to their shippers and place analogous, unbundled access requirements on the downstream pipelines. Through individual pipeline restructuring proceedings, Order No. 636 has been implemented on all U.S. interstate pipelines. There are currently a number of judicial challenges to these individual proceedings, which are now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the \"D.C. Circuit\"). In July 1996, the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the terms of the Order No. 636 rulemaking. Certain aspects of the D.C. Circuit's ruling have been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although Order No. 636 does not regulate the Trust, FERC has stated that Order No. 636 is intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. In many instances, the result of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. It is unclear what impact, if any, increased competition within the natural gas industry under Order No. 636 will have on the Trust. The FERC has recently announced its intention to reexamine certain of its transportation-related policies, including the appropriate manner for setting rates for new interstate pipeline construction, the manner in which\ninterstate pipeline shippers may release interstate pipeline capacity under Order No. 636 for resale in the secondary market, and the use of market-based rates for interstate gas transmission.",
      "Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. The Company's sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. In recent years, the FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry. As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in April 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system has been substantially restructured to remove various barriers and practices that historically limited non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, from effectively competing with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers. The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas suppliers. In many instances, the results of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. While the United States Court of Appeals has upheld most of Order No. 636, certain related FERC orders, including the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings, are still subject to judicial review and may be reversed or remanded in whole or in part. While the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that it will be affected materially differently than its competitors. The FERC has also announced several important transportation-related policy statements and proposed rule changes, including a statement of policy and a request for comments concerning alternatives to its traditional cost-of-service ratemaking methodology to establish the rates interstate pipelines may charge for their services.",
      "Commencing in late 1985, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \"FERC\") issued a series of orders that have had a major impact on interstate gas pipeline operations, services, and rates, and thus have significantly altered the marketing and price of gas. The FERC's key rule making action, Order No. 636, issued in April 1992, required each interstate pipeline to, among other things, \"unbundle\" its traditional bundled sales services and create and make available on an open and nondiscriminatory basis numerous constituent services (such as gathering services, storage services, firm and interruptible transportation services, and standby sales and gas balancing services), and to adopt a new rate making methodology to determine appropriate rates for those services. To the extent the pipeline company or its sales affiliate makes gas sales as a merchant in the future, it does so pursuant to private contracts in direct competition with all other sellers, such as Toreador; however, pipeline companies and their affiliates were not required to remain \"merchants\" of gas, and most of the interstate pipeline companies have become \"transporters only.\" In subsequent orders, the FERC largely affirmed the major features of Order No. 636 and denied a stay of the implementation of the new rules pending judicial review. By the end of 1994, the FERC had concluded the Order No. 636 restructuring proceedings, and, in general, accepted rate filings implementing Order No. 636 on every major interstate pipeline. However, even through the implementation of Order No. 636 on individual interstate pipelines is essentially complete, many of the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings, as well as orders on rehearing of Order No. 636 itself and the regulations promulgated thereunder, are subject to pending appellate review and could possibly be changed as a result of future court orders. We cannot predict whether the FERC's orders will be affirmed on appeal or what the effects will be on our business."

Mineralization\nMineralization occurs as massive to semi-massive replacements of sphalerite and galena localized by specific sedimentary facies (rock strata) within the limestone stratigraphy and by structural feeders and karst breccias. More than three-quarters of mineralization is sulfide-dominant with the remainder being oxide-dominant. A total of 11 preferred beds for replacement mineralization have been located within the middle unit of the Chambara Formation. Mineralization is associated with the conversion of limestone to dolomite, which creates porosity and permeability within the rock formations, promoting the passage of mineralizing fluids through the rock formations forming stratigraphically controlled near-horizontal manto deposits. Drilling of stratigraphic targets has shown that certain coarser-grained facies of the stratigraphy are the best hosts for manto mineralization. Stratigraphically controlled mineralization is typically one to several meters in thickness, but often attains thicknesses of five to ten meters. The laterally extensive manto deposits are strongly related to, and potentially originate from, structurally controlled near-vertical conduits for mineralizing solutions. Replacement deposits occur along these high-angle structures as well as in the stratigraphic mantos at Florida Canyon. Karst features are localized along the feeder faults and locally produce \"breakout zones\" where mineralization may extend vertically across thick stratigraphic intervals where collapse breccias have been replaced by ore minerals. Mineralized karst structures are up to 50 meters in width (horizontal), up to 100 meters vertically, and up to hundreds of meters along strike.",

The process plant would use conventional and proven mineral processing and precious metals recovery technologies. Phase 1 would have a throughput rate of 5,000 tonnes per day (tpd). During Phase 2 fresh mineralized material from the higher grade silver deposits (El Gallo Silver primarily) would only be processed at a maximum of 3,250 tpd. Tailings produced during the operation would be stored in a mined-out open pit at the El Gallo Project. As part of this process, tailings deposition would include a delivery system designed to maximize tailings consolidation and water recovery. During 2019, we expect to complete the feasibility study, and work towards obtaining regulatory approval for a permit amendment to allow for in-pit tailings storage, which is a key feature of the proposed project implementation. A decision to pursue the project has not yet been made. Access and Location\nThe Fenix Project is located adjacent to the El Gallo Project and is similarly accessible. Facilities and Infrastructure\nThe El Gallo Project infrastructure is used to support current work on the Fenix Project. In addition, the local power grid is situated approximately 15 km from the Fenix Project, and a new overhead power line would need to be installed to supply grid power to the Fenix Project.

The Fenix Project contemplates a two-phase development process. Phase 1 includes the reprocessing of material on the gold heap leach pad at the existing El Gallo Project. Phase 2 includes the processing of open pit silver mineralization from El Gallo Silver at the existing process plant. The process plant is expected to use conventional and proven mineral processing and precious metals recovery technologies. Phase 1 is envisioned to have a throughput rate of 5,000 tonnes per day. During Phase 2, mineralized material from the El Gallo Silver would be processed at a maximum of 3,250 tons per day. Tailings produced during the operation would be stored in the mined-out Samaniego open pit at the El Gallo Project. As part of this process, tailings deposition would include a delivery system designed to maximize tailings consolidation and water recovery. Utilizing the in pit tailings storage technology is expected to be cost effective and environmentally friendly as it would reduce the disturbance footprint and construction material, eliminate the construction of a tailings dam, recycle process water, and reduce closure obligations by removing the leach pad. During the second half of 2019, we received the environmental permit approval for in-pit tailings storage in the Samaniego pit and the additional approval for the process plant for Phase 1, which entails the construction of the Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) mill circuit.

The metallurgical lab is capable of determining cyanide leaching amenability and gold and silver recoveries of mineralized material amenable to cyanide leaching. Advanced-Stage Properties\nFenix Project, Mexico (100% owned)\nOverview and History\nThree areas of mineralized material located inside of our property are currently considered for the Fenix Project and are the basis of the resource estimate included in the ongoing Feasibility Study (\u201cFS\u201d). The Fenix Project contemplates a two-phase development process. Phase 1 includes the reprocessing of material on the gold heap leach pad at the existing El Gallo Project and open pit mining at the El Encuentro area. Phase 2 includes the processing of open pit silver mineralization from El Gallo Silver. The process plant is expected to use conventional and proven mineral processing and precious metals recovery technologies. Phase 1 would have a throughput rate of 5,510 tons per day (5,000 tonnes per day (tpd)). During Phase 2, mineralized material from the El Gallo Silver would only be processed at a maximum of 3,580 tons per day (3,250 tpd). Tailings produced during the operation would be stored in a mined-out open pit at the El Gallo Project. As part of this process, tailings deposition would include a delivery system designed to maximize tailings consolidation and water recovery. Utilizing the in pit tailings storage technology is expected to be cost effective and environmentally friendly as it would reduce the disturbance footprint and construction material, eliminate the construction of a tailings dam, recycle process water, and reduce closure obligations by removing the leach pad. During the second half of 2019, we received the environmental permit approval for in-pit tailings storage in the Samaniego pit and the additional approval for the process plant for Phase 1, which entails the construction of the Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) mill circuit. A decision to pursue the project has not yet been made."

Chicago is recognized as one of the most important industrial and financial centers in the United States. It is the nation\u2019s largest producer of steel and machinery, has the world\u2019s largest commodities market and is the nation\u2019s largest wholesaling center. Chicago\u2019s mid-continent location and accessibility via both land and water have made it the central hub of the United States. The Chicago area thrives on its strong, diverse, and growing economy in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, communications, publishing, banking, finance, insurance, law, advertising, accounting, medicine, and high technology. The Chicago area also enjoys one of the finest transportation systems of any urban area, a highly skilled labor pool, and an appreciation of and devotion to cultural and recreational activities that attract corporations and tourists from around the world. Competition\nThe primary competitors of Stratford Square include two super-regional shopping centers situated within Stratford Square Mall\u2019s trade region. In addition, there are two smaller malls that compete to a lesser degree with the subject property. A summary of Stratford Square\u2019s competitors are as follows:\n\u2022\nWoodfield Mall. The 2.3 million square-foot Woodfield Shopping Center is anchored by Nordstrom, Marshall Field\u2019s, Lord & Taylor, Sears and JCPenney and is located approximately eight miles from Stratford Square.\n\u2022\nOakbrook Center. The 2.0 million square-foot Oakbrook Center is an outdoor mall anchored by Nordstrom, Marshall Field\u2019s, Neiman-Marcus, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Lord & Taylor and Sears and is located about 11 miles from Stratford Square.\n\u2022\nCharlestown Mall.",
      "Wholly Owned Properties\nStratford Square Mall\nOverview\nOn December 30, 2004, we acquired Stratford Square Mall for a base purchase price of $93.1 million. We are investing an additional $45.8 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Stratford Square Mall, of which $16.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2006, for an estimated total project cost of approximately $138.9 million. Stratford Square Mall is a 1.3 million square-foot, super-regional mall located in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Located in the rapidly growing and affluent DuPage County, a northwestern suburb of Chicago, the mall had an overall occupancy of 90.6% as of December 31, 2006 with shop tenant occupancy of 66.4% (excluding temporary and anchor tenants). The mall has six non-owned anchor tenants: Kohl\u2019s, Sears, Carson Pirie Scott (a unit of the Saks Department Store Group), Marshall Fields, JCPenney and Burlington Coat Factory. Average mall shop sales for 2006 were approximately $286 per square foot, an amount that we intend to increase through capital expenditures focused on improving shopper traffic and tenant sales. Plans to boost shopper traffic and tenant sales include building a new multi-screen cineplex with stadium seating (estimated to be completed in the third quarter 2007), adding one or more junior anchor tenants, multiple sit-down restaurants, outdoor cafes and streetscape retail, new property signage and other general capital improvements. The mall\u2019s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Forever 21, Abercrombie & Fitch, Pacific Sun, American Eagle, Claire\u2019s, Bath & Body Works, The Children\u2019s Place, The Gap, f.y.e., Limited Too and Victoria\u2019s Secret. The shops are comprised of approximately 450,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court. Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop sales at Stratford Square in calendar 2006 were $286 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. We believe that in 2006 the Stratford Square Macy\u2019s had approximately $19 million in sales, Sears had approximately $20 million in sales, JCPenney had sales of $20 million, Carson Pirie Scott had sales of $20 million, Kohl\u2019s had sales of $20 million and Burlington Coat Factory had sales of $15 million."

      "Overview and History\nThe San Jos\u00e9 mine is an underground gold and silver mining operation located in Santa Cruz, Argentina. We acquired our interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine in connection with our acquisition of Minera Andes in January 2012. The property is owned and operated under an option and joint venture agreement (\u201cOJVA\u201d) between Minera Andes (49%) and Hochschild (51%) in the name of MSC. The property was acquired by Minera Andes in 1997, followed by an extensive exploration program from 1997 to 2001, leading to the discovery of the Huevos Verdes and Saavedra West Zones. A feasibility study was completed in October 2005 under the direction of MSC and, following construction, commercial production was declared on January 1, 2008. The mine is part of a larger property which covers a total area of approximately 1,004 sq. miles and consists of 141 mining concessions. MSC has purchased the land and corresponding occupation rights that are necessary to conduct its operations. Location and Access\nThe San Jos\u00e9 property is in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, lying approximately between latitude 46\u00b041\u2019S and 46\u00b047\u2019S and longitude 70\u00b017\u2019W and 70\u00b000\u2019W. The mine is 1,087 miles south-southwest of the city of Buenos Aires and 217 miles southwest of the Atlantic port city of Comodoro Rivadavia. The principal access route to the San Jos\u00e9 property is a paved highway from Comodoro Rivadavia followed by a 20 mile two-lane dirt road to the mine. Comodoro Rivadavia has regularly scheduled air services to Buenos Aires. The nearest town is Perito Moreno, which is approximately 19 miles west of the San Jos\u00e9 property. Geology and Mineralization\nThe San Jos\u00e9 property is in the Deseado Massif, which consists of Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks unconformably overlain by Middle to Upper Jurassic bimodal andesitic and rhyolitic volcanics and volcaniclastics. Cretaceous sediments and Tertiary to Quaternary basalts overlie the Jurassic volcanics. The Jurassic Bajo Pobre Formation is the main host of gold and silver vein mineralization at the mine."

      "Item 2. Properties. Location and Characteristics\nThe Company owns oil and natural gas leases in Wyoming, Utah, and Pennsylvania. In Colorado, the Company owns oil and natural gas leases as well as fee oil and gas rights. The leases in Wyoming are primarily federal leases with 10-year lease terms until establishment of production. Production extends the lease terms until cessation of that production. In Pennsylvania, the leases are from private individuals and companies, as well as from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The leases in Utah are from private individuals and companies, the State of Utah, and the federal government with primary lease terms ranging from five to ten years until the establishment of production. In 2014, the Company sold the surface rights to its undeveloped acreage in Colorado Springs, Colorado while retaining the oil and gas rights. The Company has no immediate plans for further exploration in Colorado during 2015. Green River Basin, Wyoming\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company owned oil and natural gas leases totaling approximately 103,000 gross (67,000 net) acres in southwest Wyoming\u2019s Green River Basin. Most of this acreage covers the Pinedale and Jonah fields. Of the total acreage position in Wyoming, approximately 29,000 gross (19,000 net) acres were developed, and 74,000 gross (48,000 net) acres were undeveloped. The developed portion represents\n58% of the Company\u2019s total developed net acreage while the undeveloped portion represents approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s total undeveloped net acreage.

Gold was extracted in a heap-leach operation from sanded and silicified dolomite and silicified shale. No geologic maps exist from this period other than a few maps compiled from USGS work. Although many drill hole location maps are archived in Century Gold files, the coordinates for many drill hole collars are not available, very few collars are visible in the field, and assay data from infill drilling is poorly documented. Exploration: 2005 to 2010 (Staccato Gold) Staccato Gold advanced exploration of the Eureka property and completed drilling between 2005 and 2007, and in follow-up initiated a comprehensive work program in June 2008 which included geologic modeling of all drilling results. This modeling included structural and stratigraphic controls to mineralization, additional density determinations, and new drilling and metallurgical test data. Results of this work were incorporated into subsequent exploration work completed since 2008. From 2005-2007 core drilling programs at Lookout Mountain completed by Staccato Gold provided data to better define stratigraphy in the higher-grade breccia-hosted gold zones at the Lookout Mountain pit and discovered new areas of mineralization. The core drilling and a drill hole re-logging program demonstrated the stratabound nature of gold mineralization in thick zones of collapse breccia within carbonate rock flanking the Ratto Ridge structural zone. Metallurgical and other technical characteristics of known mineralization were subsequently investigated at Lookout Mountain. In October 2009, Staccato Gold also initiated work at the Windfall Project including detailed mapping and sampling programs and completed a ten-hole drill program totaling 8,030 feet (2,448 m). The drilling program focused on testing the extent of gold mineralization below the Windfall and Rustler open pits, located approximately 3 miles northeast of the main Lookout Mountain project mineralized area.",
      "Wilson\u2019s work emphasized the east side of Hamburg Ridge, the Windfall Trend, where he drilled, with conventional air rotary, holes through, and Z-1 through Z-31, Z42, and ZA-1 on the current Windfall group. He drilled holes Z32-41 on the Hoosac group. The drill holes were generally from 50 to 250 feet deep. Six of Wilson\u2019s original forty-three Z-holes intersected gold mineralization exceeding 0.02 oz of gold/ton. This success led to infill drilling and the development of the Windfall open pit mine in 1975, and soon thereafter, the Rustler and Paroni open pit mines.

Although many drill hole location maps are archived in Century Gold files, the coordinates for many drill hole collars are not available, very few collars are visible in the field, and assay data from infill drilling is poorly documented. Scoping Study\nStaccato Gold retained SRK Consulting U.S. Inc.(SRK) to complete a preliminary economic scoping study of the Lookout Mountain project in 2007. The study was not completed when it became evident that more technical data was needed to assess the economics of the project, and that SRK had issues with some of the methodology used in the earlier mineralization estimate. Specifically, SRK identified that grade shells were not used appropriately to limit tons and grade estimation. In addition, SRK was of the opinion that insufficient geological constraints were employed in the mineralization estimation which could lead to inflated numbers. SRK also believed the density values used in the tonnage calculations were too high, and that in its opinion, additional density determinations were required to improve tonnage calculations in the Lookout Mountain mineralized material estimate. Technical Work Program In order to improve understanding of the technical aspects of the project, address the issues noted by SRK, and evaluate the potential of the South Eureka property, Staccato Gold initiated a comprehensive work program in June 2008.",

The Windfall project is one of several prospective gold projects on our extensive Eureka property in Nevada. Results from the surface mapping program, review of historic production and geologic maps, and drilling indicate that high-grade gold is locally controlled within cross structures cutting the main Windfall fault zone, at the contact between the Hamburg Dolomite and Dunderburg Shale. The 2009 drill program tested approximately 3,600 feet of strike length of the Windfall fault zone with wide spaced drilling."

      "A) AEP will face minimal operational changes as the Kyoto Protocol is unlikely to be ratified and the Acid Rain Program is already in effect.",
      "B) AEP will experience significant operational disruptions due to the stringent emission reduction requirements of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Acid Rain Program.",
      "C) AEP will adapt its operations by investing in cleaner technologies and potentially increasing electricity prices to offset the costs associated with compliance.",
      "D) AEP will challenge the legality of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Acid Rain Program, arguing that they are economically burdensome and lack scientific justification."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "However, it is management's belief that the Kyoto Protocol is highly unlikely to be ratified or implemented in the U. S.\nWest Virginia SO(2) Limits: West Virginia promulgated SO(2) limitations, which Federal EPA approved in February 1978. The emission limitations for the Mitchell Plant have been approved by Federal EPA for primary ambient air quality (health-related) standards only. West Virginia is obligated to reanalyze SO(2) emission limits for the Mitchell Plant with respect to secondary ambient air quality (welfare-related) standards. Because the CAA provides no specific deadline for approval of emission limits to achieve secondary ambient air quality standards, it is not certain when Federal EPA will take dispositive action regarding the Mitchell Plant. On August 4, 1994, Federal EPA issued a Notice of Violation to OPCo alleging that Kammer Plant was operating in violation of the applicable federally enforceable SO(2) emission limit. On May 20, 1996, the Notice of Violation and an enforcement action subsequently filed by Federal EPA were resolved through the entry of a consent decree in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. As of December 31, 1999, Kammer Plant had achieved compliance with an SO(2) emission limit of 2.7 lb. mm/Btu design heat input, pursuant to the provisions of the consent decree and the federally approved West Virginia State Implementation Plan. Short Term SO(2) Limits: On January 2, 1997, Federal EPA proposed a new intervention level program under the authority of Section 303 of the CAA to address five minute peak SO(2) concentrations believed to pose a health risk to certain segments of the population. The proposal establishes a \"concern\" level and an \"endangerment\" level. States must investigate exceedances of the concern level and decide whether to take corrective action. If the endangerment level is exceeded, the state must take action to reduce SO(2) levels. The effects of this proposed intervention program on AEP operations cannot be predicted at this time.",
      "The Companies cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy. The Companies believe they are complying with SO2 reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx reductions required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Companies' facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 percent reduction in utility plant NOx emissions from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states (including Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based on a conclusion that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States. The Companies believe their facilities are also complying with the NOx budgets established under State Implementation Plans (SIPs) through combustion controls and post-combustion controls, including Selective Catalytic Reduction and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction systems, and/or using emission allowances. National Ambient Air Quality Standards\nIn July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the NAAQS for ozone and proposed a new NAAQS for fine particulate matter. On December 17, 2003, the EPA proposed the \"Interstate Air Quality Rule\" covering a total of 29 states (including Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based on proposed findings that air pollution emissions from 29 eastern states and the District of Columbia significantly contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQS for fine particles and/or the \"8-hour\" ozone NAAQS in other states. The EPA has proposed the Interstate Air Quality Rule to \"cap-and-trade\" NOx and SO2 emissions in two phases (Phase I in 2010 and Phase II in 2015).",
      "There are two phases of SO(2) control under the Acid Rain Program. Phase I, effective January 1, 1995, required SO(2) emission reductions from certain units that emitted SO(2) above a rate of 2.5 pounds per million Btu heat input in 1985. Phase II, which affects all fossil fuel-fired steam generating units with capacity greater than 25 megawatts imposes more stringent SO(2) emission control requirements beginning January 1, 2000. If a unit emitted SO(2) in 1985 at a rate in excess of 1.2 pounds per million Btu heat input, the Phase II allowance allocation is premised upon an emission rate of 1.2 pounds at 1985 utilization levels. In addition to regulating SO(2) emissions, Title IV of the CAAA regulates emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Federal EPA has promulgated NOx emission limitations for all boiler types in the AEP System at levels significantly below original design. All emission limitations were to be achieved by January 1, 2000 on a unit-by-unit or System-wide average basis. Title I National Ambient Air Quality Standards Attainment: The CAA contains additional provisions, other than the Acid Rain Program, which could require reductions in emissions of NOx and other pollutants from fossil fuel-fired power plants. See NOx SIP Call and Section 126 Petitions below. In July 1997, Federal EPA revised the ozone and particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), creating a new eight-hour ozone standard and establishing a new standard for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM(2.5)). Both of these new standards have the potential to affect adversely the operation of AEP System generating units. In May 1999, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the ozone and PM(2.5) NAAQS to Federal EPA. Following denial of a request for rehearing and rehearing en banc by the Circuit Court, Federal EPA and several others filed petitions for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on January 27, 2000. In September 1998, Federal EPA issued revisions to the New Source Performance Standards applicable to new and modified fossil fuel-fired power plants.",
      "AEP is reevaluating its air releases and will provide supplemental information as appropriate. Global Climate Change: In December 1997, delegates from 167 nations, including the United States, agreed to a treaty, known as the \"Kyoto Protocol,\" establishing legally-binding emission reductions for gases suspected of causing climate change. If the U.S. becomes a party to the treaty it will be bound to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane and nitrous oxides by 7% below 1990 levels and emissions of hydrofluorcarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride 7% below 1995 levels in the years 2008-2012. The Protocol was available for signature from March 16, 1998 to March 15, 1999 and requires ratification by at least 55 nations that account for at least 55% of developed countries' 1990 emissions of CO(2) to enter into force. Although the United States has agreed to the treaty and signed it on November 12, 1998, President Clinton has indicated that he will not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it contains requirements for \"meaningful participation by key developing countries\" and the rules, procedures, methodology and guidelines of the treaty's market-based policy instruments, joint implementation programs and compliance enforcement provisions have been negotiated. At the Fourth Conference of the Parties, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, the parties agreed to a work plan to complete negotiations on outstanding issues with a view toward approving them at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to be held in November 2000. Since the AEP System is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by the imposition of limitations on CO(2) emissions if compliance costs cannot be fully recovered from customers. In addition, any such severe program to reduce CO(2) emissions could impose substantial costs on industry and society and erode the economic base that AEP's operations serve."

      "As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success, prices, future production levels and costs, that may not prove correct over time. Predictions of future production levels are subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. Oil and gas prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. The calculated weighted average sales prices utilized for the purposes of estimating the Company's proved reserves and future net revenue were and $25.35 per barrel of oil and $3.02 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1996, $18.64 per barrel of oil and $1.56 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1995 and $16.44 per barrel of oil and $1.63 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1994.

      "These prices are on average less than spot market prices at December 31, 1996. If such Fixed-Price Contracts were not in effect and the Company used December 31, 1996 wellhead prices, the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves and the Present Value thereof would be $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. The reserve data set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate.

      "The reserve data set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment and the existence of development plans. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success, prices, future production levels and cost, that may not prove correct over time. Predictions about prices and future production levels are subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. Oil and gas prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. There is no assurance that prices will not be materially higher or lower than the prices utilized in estimating Basin's reserves. The weighted average sales prices utilized for purposes of estimating Basin's proved reserves and future net revenues therefrom as of December 31, 1996 were $25.35 per Bbl for oil and $3.02 per Mcf for gas. These prices are significantly above average prices prevailing during most of the past several years, and oil and gas prices have declined from such levels during the first two months of 1997. PRODUCTION\nThe following table sets forth Basin's net oil and gas production, average sales prices, and costs and expenses associated with such production during the periods indicated. Basin owned 363 gross (229 net) producing oil wells and 57 gross (39 net) producing gas wells as of December 31, 1996. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced when it first commenced production, and such designation may not be indicative of current production.",
      "The Company estimates that if all other factors (including the estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves) were held constant, a $1.00 per Bbl change in oil prices and a $.10 per Mcf change in gas prices from those used in calculating the Present Value would change such Present Value by $14 million and $57 million, respectively. The prices used in calculating the Estimated Future Net Revenues attributable to proved reserves do not consider the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts for the corresponding volumes and production periods. These contract prices are on average higher than spot market prices at December 31, 1999. If Fixed-Price Contract pricing was used at December 31, 1999, the Estimated Future Net Revenues and the Present Value attributable to proved reserves would be $2.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the Company.

      "PF Chang\u2019s is also widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw with typical annual sales volumes of $6.0 million. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. A lease was also executed with Barnes & Noble for a 33,000 square-foot store including an exterior entrance facing Wolf Road, as well as an entrance fronting onto the main mall corridor. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. A lease was also executed with L.L. Bean for an approximately 30,000 square-foot store. This will be L.L. Bean\u2019s first store in the state of New York. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop tenant sales for Colonie Center in 2006 were $302 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. However, the mediocre shop sales are in sharp contrast to the mall\u2019s strong anchor tenant sales. We believe that in 2006, the Colonie Center Macy\u2019s had approximately $61.5 million in sales and Sears had approximately $51 million in sales. We also believe that each will continue to operate as anchor tenant strongholds for Colonie Center. Boscov\u2019s had annual sales of $28 million in 2006. In addition, Christmas Tree Shops reported sales in 2006 of $21 million, which equates to sales of over $379 per square foot. Collectively, the Colonie Center anchor tenants reported approximately $163 million in combined sales in 2006. We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the property\u2019s rental revenue. Financing\nIn June 2005, we completed a $50.8 million first mortgage bridge financing collateralized by the Colonie Center Mall. Subsequently, in September 2006, we refinanced the bridge loan with a new construction loan that currently has a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $116 million. The new construction loan matures in October 2008. A portion of this loan, in the amount of $50.8 million, has a fixed interest rate of 6.84%.",
      "One of these newly signed leases was executed with Regal Cinemas. The new Regal Theater at Colonie will be a 60,000 square foot, luxury and state-of-the-art stadium-seated 14 screen movie theater. The theater will rise nearly 10 stories in height and will be situated over the existing roof of the mall. The height of the theater is expected to create dramatic sight lines to Interstate 87. One of the newly signed leases is the Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake Factory is widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw. The average Cheesecake Factory has sales of over $11.0 million per annum. Typical wait times for a Cheesecake Factory are one to two hours. As a result of this unusually long waiting time, an enormous amount of additional mall traffic is anticipated. In addition, a lease was recently executed with PF Chang\u2019s China Bistro for approximately 7,000 square feet. PF Chang\u2019s is also widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw with typical annual sales volumes of $6.0 million.

We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the property\u2019s rental revenue. Financing\nWe financed the acquisition of Colonie Center from the net proceeds from our recent initial public offering and proceeds from the Stratford Square Mall mortgage. We may elect to place mortgage financing on the property and use the proceeds from such financing to acquire additional properties. Renovation and Repositioning Plan\nOur opportunity, with respect to Colonie Center, is to take advantage of the mall\u2019s unusually strong anchor tenant sales and leverage such sales into higher shop tenant sales. In addition, with approximately 123,000 square feet of shop space available, there is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program.",

Colonie Center\nOverview\nIn February 2005, we acquired the Colonie Center Mall for a base purchase price of $82.2 million. We paid additional consideration of $2.4 million in connection with the execution of certain pending leases that increased the purchase price to $84.6 million. We plan to invest an additional $108.1 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Colonie Center, of which we incurred $40.5 million through December 31, 2006, for an estimated total project cost of $192.7 million. Colonie Center is a 1.2 million square-foot, super-regional mall serving Albany, New York and its surrounding areas. Colonie Center is anchored by four major department stores: Macy\u2019s, Sears, Boscov\u2019s and Christmas Tree Shops (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond). In addition, the mall has two important \u201cjunior anchors\u201d, which are Steve & Barry\u2019s and an f.y.e. super store. The mall\u2019s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Bath & Body Works, Bombay Company, The Children\u2019s Place, The Gap, Limited Too and Victoria\u2019s Secret. The 110 shops are comprised of approximately 381,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court, restaurants and caf\u00e9s."

      "ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES\nOur real estate investments consist of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development, and land or land options held for development. The following is a description of each category:\nCurrent Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following:\no Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized operating costs as of the beginning of the prior year. We determine which of our communities fall into the Established Communities category annually on January 1 of each year and maintain that classification throughout the year. For the year 2000, the Established Communities were communities that had stabilized operating costs as of January 1, 1999. o Other Stabilized Communities are all other completed communities that have stabilized occupancy and are not undergoing or planning redevelopment activities. We consider a community to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment. For the year 2000, Other Stabilized Communities therefore include communities that were either acquired or achieved stabilization after January 1, 1999 and that were not undergoing or planning redevelopment activities. o Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where occupancy has not reached 95%. o Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to take place during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of $5 million or 10% of the community's acquisition cost. Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received.",
      "ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES\nThe Company's real estate holdings consist of apartment communities in various stages of the development cycle and can be divided into three categories:\n\"Current Communities\" are apartment communities where construction is complete and the community has either reached stabilized occupancy or is in the initial lease-up process. A \"Stabilized Community\" is a Current Community that has completed its initial lease-up and has attained a physical occupancy level of 94% or has been completed for one year, whichever occurs earlier. An \"Established Community\" is a Current Community that has been a Stabilized Community with stabilized operating costs during both the current year and the beginning of the previous calendar year such that its year-to-date operating results are comparable between periods. \"Development Communities\" are communities that are under construction and may be partially complete and operating and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. \"Development Rights\" are development opportunities in the very earliest phase of the development process for which the Company has an option to acquire land or owns land to develop a new community and where related pre-development costs have been incurred and capitalized in pursuit of these new developments. The Company's holdings under each of the above categories are discussed in the following paragraphs. Current Communities\nThe Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two-and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The Current Communities, as of March 16, 1998, include eight high-rise apartment communities, two four-story mid-rise apartment communities and one six-story mid-rise apartment community. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities designed to enhance their market appeal to discriminating residents who are willing to pay premium rental rates to live in these apartment communities. Such amenities include vaulted ceilings, lofts, fireplaces, patios/decks and modern appliances."

      "The reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests are expected to decline substantially during the term of the Trust, and a portion of each cash distribution made by the Trust will, therefore, be analogous to a return of capital.

For example, based upon the production estimates set forth in the Reserve Estimate, annual production attributable to the Royalty Interests is estimated to decline from 2.3 Bcf in 2009 to 1.5 Bcf in 2013. Detailed information concerning the number of wells on royalty properties is not generally available to the owner of Royalty Interests. Consequently, the Registrant does not have information that would be disclosed by a company with oil and gas operations, such as an accurate count of the number of wells located on the Underlying Properties, the number of exploratory or development wells drilled on the Underlying Properties during the periods presented by this report, or the number of wells in process or other present activities on the Underlying Properties, and the Registrant cannot readily obtain such information. Miscellaneous. Ralph E. Davis & Associates has delivered to the Trust the Reserve Estimate, a summary of which is included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Information concerning historical changes in net proved developed reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests, and the calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net revenues related thereto, is contained in Note 8 of the Notes to the Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 hereof. Neither the Company nor Highmount Alabama has filed reserve estimates covering the Royalty Interests with any other federal authority or agency. Natural Gas Sales Prices and Production\nThe following table sets forth the actual net production volumes attributable to the Royalty Interests, weighted average property, production and related taxes and information regarding natural gas sales prices for the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.",

      "Barrick Gold Corporation\u2019s Goldstrike mine in Nevada uses a thiosulfate leaching circuit that went into commercial production in 2015. Our work showed that thiosulphate leaching of head ore concentrates, followed by resin extraction, was very effective in bench and pilot scale tests conducted off site for the extraction of gold and silver, as \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d from materials extracted from the Columbus Project. Aqua regia and cyanide leaching tests of head ore and aqua regia leaching of concentrates had previously proved ineffective and resulted in extremely low gold and silver extraction. However, both thiosulphate and cyanide leaching of concentrates have extracted commercial values on samples extracted from the Columbus Project. It is the thiosulphate leach system that was installed at the on-site pilot plant in 2013 to determine the feasibility of leaching both the sand and clay deposits. To ensure the reliability of our results, unless specifically stated otherwise, we have instituted rigorous QA/QC protocols, including blind random sampling, and the inclusion of blanks, standards and duplicates. To further ensure reliability, we measure only the actual amount of gold and silver physically extracted from our test samples when reporting assay results. Caustic fusion provides \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d on head ore and concentrates as do thiosulphate leach and cyanide leach on gravity concentrates. Using these assay methods, together with the quality assurances and quality controls of the drill program, we and our consultants are confident of the previous results that we have reported from head ore and concentrate samples. Fire assaying is the most common pyrometallurgical method used for extracting gold and silver from rock. Fire assaying relies on the use of standardized chemical fluxes to reduce the melting point of the minerals entombing the gold and silver so that they can be liberated and collected in a lead \u201cbutton\u201d and examined. Although this process works well for extracting gold entombed in sulfides (e.g. pyrite) and silica, such as that found in Carlin-type gold deposits, the chemical fluxes used in fire assaying methods are ineffective at liberating the gold and silver from refractory minerals (organics and silicates (Fe-Mg-Al-Si-Ox)) as are found at the Columbus Project.",
      "In recent years, thiosulphate leaching has been extensively studied as an alternative to cyanide because it is an environmentally friendly, hydrometallurgical method for extracting gold and silver from ores.

      "We cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs.

Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 totaled $29,937,000 and $27,635,000, respectively. Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments\nAcquisitions of Existing Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired two communities. The Promenade, located in Burbank, California, contains 400 apartment homes and was acquired for a total price of $70,300,000, which includes the assumption of $33,900,000 of floating-rate, tax-exempt debt. Avalon Greyrock, located in Stamford, Connecticut, contains 306 apartment homes and was acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated third party for a total acquisition cost of approximately $69,900,000. One DownREIT partnership was formed since January 1, 2002 in conjunction with the acquisition of land by that partnership. Sales of Existing Communities.

To achieve this increased concentration, we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility.",
      "Likewise, costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded Management's original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. There can be no assurances that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or repositioned communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction costs. Capitalized Interest In accordance with GAAP, the Company capitalizes interest expense during construction or reconstruction until each building obtains a certificate of occupancy; thereafter, interest for each completed building is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 totaled $16,977,000, $6,985,000 and $2,567,000, respectively. Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments\nAcquisitions of Existing Communities. In 1998, Avalon, Bay and, following the Merger, the Company acquired an aggregate of 13 communities containing 4,166 apartment homes. These communities are summarized as follows:\nOn January 7, 1998, Avalon purchased Avalon at Town Centre, a 246 apartment home community, and Avalon at Town Square, a 160 apartment home community, both of which are located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $27,625,000. On April 30, 1998, Avalon purchased Avalon at Oxford Hill, a 480 apartment home community located in St. Louis, Missouri, for approximately $29,760,000. On May 29, 1998, Avalon purchased The Gates of Edinburgh, a 198 apartment home community located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, for approximately $17,950,000. On January 14, 1998, Bay purchased Warner Oaks, a 227 apartment home community located in the Los Angeles, California area, for approximately $20,100,000. On January 28, 1998, Bay purchased Amberway, a 272 apartment home community located in Orange County, California, and Arbor Park, a 260 apartment home community located in the Los Angeles, California area, for approximately $17,500,000 and $12,400,000, respectively. On February 11, 1998, Bay purchased Laguna Brisas, a 176 apartment home community located in the Los Angeles, California area, for approximately $17,400,000.",
      "Capitalized Interest In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we capitalize interest expense during construction or reconstruction until an apartment home obtains a certificate of occupancy. Thereafter, the interest allocated to that completed apartment home within the community is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 totaled $18,328,000 and $21,888,000, respectively. Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments\nAcquisitions of Existing Communities. We have acquired seven communities containing 1,960 apartment homes since January 1, 2000 for an acquisition price of approximately $252,400,000. Six of the communities were acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated party. Sales of Existing Communities. We seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:\no apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth; o reduce operating expenses; and o leverage management talent. To achieve this increased concentration, we are selling assets in certain submarkets and intend to redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities currently under construction or reconstruction. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable like-kind exchange transaction. Accordingly, we sold nine communities, totaling 2,158 apartment homes, since January 1, 2000. Net proceeds from the sales of these assets totaled $138,924,000. Land Acquisitions and Leases for New Developments. We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2000, we acquired the following land parcels for future development:\n(1) Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
      "Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, including:\n- land and/or property acquisition costs; - construction costs; - real estate taxes; - capitalized interest; - loan fees; - permits; - professional fees; - allocated development overhead; and - other regulatory fees determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nonetheless, because of increases in prevailing market rents we believe that, in the aggregate, we will still achieve our targeted projected yield (i.e., return on invested capital) for those communities experiencing costs in excess of the original budget. We believe that we could experience similar increases in construction costs and market rents with respect to other development communities resulting in total construction costs that exceed original budgets. Likewise, costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. We cannot assure that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or repositioned communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs. Capitalized Interest In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we capitalize interest expense during construction or reconstruction until a building obtains a certificate of occupancy. Thereafter, the interest allocated to that completed building within the community is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 totaled $21,888,000, $14,724,000 and $9,024,000, respectively. Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments\nAcquisitions of Existing Communities. On July 12, 1999 we acquired Avalon at Woodbury through a DownREIT partnership for approximately $25,750,000 (including 117,178 units of limited partnership in the DownREIT partnership valued at $4,614,000) pursuant to a presale agreement signed in 1997 with an unaffiliated company."

We have completed the installation of electrical service to this location, thereby reducing operating costs through the elimination of rental equipment for power generation. The oil produced into this facility has a similar API gravity to the oil at the Sunday production facility and the oil must also be heated to separate and remove water in preparation for sale. Exploration Properties\nBull Run Prospect\nThis prospect is located in the southern portion of our acreage position. The drilling targets are the Etchegoin and Santa Margarita sands located between 800 and 1,200 feet deep. We drilled an exploratory well on this prospect in December 2011 that was determined to be not viable for commercial production and the well was plugged and abandoned. Utilizing the data received from this well, we expect to drill another exploratory well on this prospect during 2012. The Bull Run wells will require a pilot steam flood and additional production facilities. We have a 41.67% working interest in this prospect. Sherman Prospect\nThis prospect is located in the southern portion of our acreage position. The drilling targets are the Olcese and Etchegoin sands between 1,000 and 2,000 feet deep. We plan to drill an exploratory well in 2012. We have a 41.67% working interest in this prospect.

The oil must be heated to separate and remove water to prepare it to be sold. We constructed these facilities during the summer and fall of 2009 and at the same time established electrical service for our field by constructing three miles of power lines. As a result, our average operating costs have been reduced from over $40 per barrel to a monthly average of approximately $26 per barrel of oil for the year ended February 29, 2012.

      "These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional performance data. These reserve revisions result primarily from increases or decreases in performance due to a variety of factors such as an addition to or a reduction in recoveries below or above previously established, lowest, known hydrocarbon levels, improvements or deteriorations in drainage from natural drive mechanisms, and increases or decreases to drainage areas. If the estimates of proved reserves were to decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense would increase. Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2012, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 20.4 Bcf of natural gas. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are located in Poland, and all are associated with wells that have been drilled, tested, and completed for production. These reserves are classified as proved undeveloped because relatively major expenditures are required for the completion of production facilities, which includes the construction of pipelines to connect the wells to the existing pipeline in order to fully develop the reserves and commence production. We do not have any proved undeveloped reserves attributable to undrilled locations, so the development of such undeveloped reserves is not dependent on additional drilling on undrilled acreage. All development activities will be completed within five years of reserve bookings. Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nNo reserves were converted from undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2011, to developed reserves at December 31, 2012. Development Costs\nCosts incurred relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $2.3 million in 2012, almost all of which were attributable to the construction of production facilities at our Winna Gora and Lisewo wells. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves are projected to be approximately $13.0 million in 2013.",
      "Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. We emphasize that the volume of reserves are estimates that by their nature are subject to revision. The estimates are made using geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional performance data. These reserve revisions result primarily from increases or decreases in performance from a variety of sources such as an addition to or a reduction in recoveries below or above previously established lowest known hydrocarbon levels, improvements or deteriorations in drainage from natural drive mechanisms, and increases or decreases to drainage areas.

      "AEP is reevaluating its air releases and will provide supplemental information as appropriate. Global Climate Change: In December 1997, delegates from 167 nations, including the United States, agreed to a treaty, known as the \"Kyoto Protocol,\" establishing legally-binding emission reductions for gases suspected of causing climate change. If the U.S. becomes a party to the treaty it will be bound to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane and nitrous oxides by 7% below 1990 levels and emissions of hydrofluorcarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride 7% below 1995 levels in the years 2008-2012. The Protocol was available for signature from March 16, 1998 to March 15, 1999 and requires ratification by at least 55 nations that account for at least 55% of developed countries' 1990 emissions of CO(2) to enter into force. Although the United States has agreed to the treaty and signed it on November 12, 1998, President Clinton has indicated that he will not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it contains requirements for \"meaningful participation by key developing countries\" and the rules, procedures, methodology and guidelines of the treaty's market-based policy instruments, joint implementation programs and compliance enforcement provisions have been negotiated. At the Fourth Conference of the Parties, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, the parties agreed to a work plan to complete negotiations on outstanding issues with a view toward approving them at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to be held in November 2000. Since the AEP System is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by the imposition of limitations on CO(2) emissions if compliance costs cannot be fully recovered from customers. In addition, any such severe program to reduce CO(2) emissions could impose substantial costs on industry and society and erode the economic base that AEP's operations serve.",
      "The Safe Drinking Water Act, or \u201cSDWA\u201d, and analogous state laws impose requirements relating to underground injection activities. Under these laws, the EPA and state environmental agencies have adopted regulations relating to permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as prohibitions against the migration of injected fluids into underground sources of drinking water. Air emissions . The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, EPA and certain states have developed and continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change became effective in February 2005. Under the Protocol, participating nations are required to implement programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases that are suspected of contributing to global warming. The United States is not currently a participant in the Protocol, and Congress has not acted upon recent proposed legislation directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there has been support in various regions of the country for legislation that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and some states have already adopted legislation addressing greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, primarily power plants. The oil and natural gas industry is a direct source of certain greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide and methane, and future restrictions on such emissions could impact our future operations.

      "In addition, climate change is the subject of an important public policy debate and the basis for new legislation proposed by the United States Congress and certain states. Some states have adopted climate change statutes and regulations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect January 1, 2010, and required reporting by regulated facilities by September 30, 2011 and annually thereafter. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule that sets forth reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry and requires persons that hold state drilling permits that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to report annually carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from certain sources. Under a regulatory extension, the deadline for the petroleum and natural gas industry sources to report their greenhouse gas emissions was changed to September 28, 2012. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of future generations. The EPA indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that established new source performance standards for volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC(s)\u201d) and sulfur dioxide, an air toxics standard for major sources of oil and natural gas production, and an air toxics standard for major sources of natural gas transmission and storage. Beginning January 1, 2015, all hydraulically fractured or refractured natural gas wells had to be completed using so called \u201cgreen completion\u201d technology, which significantly reduces VOC emissions. Limiting emissions of VOCs will have the co-benefit of also limiting methane, a greenhouse gas. These regulations apply to natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, and to storage tanks and other equipment.",

      "Independent sampling of remaining core to compare with historical assays was attempted, however a large portion of the split core from Cyprus drilling is no longer available and assays for samples that have been archived for over 20 years are not a good comparison with the originally fresh core samples. However, Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates has concluded that of the limited number of samples collected, individual sample variances occur, but globally the grades do not differ much. Reconciliations As the drill hole database is the foundation of the resource and reserve estimates, Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates has concluded that the most significant verification of the drill hole database is the comparison of its derived block model with the production of mined material.

      "TXCO contracts with Netherland Sewell & Associates, a Dallas-based engineering firm to provide reserve estimates for reporting purposes. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties\nThe Company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. The Company estimates the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets, events may arise that would require the Company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties. The Company has recognized impairments in prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future. Income Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income and other similar taxes on its operations. When recording income tax expense or benefit, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of the calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses or benefits are recognized. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization.",
      "The expected future cash flows are estimated based on the Partnership\u2019s plans to continue to produce proved reserves. Expected future cash flow from the sale of production of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices. The Partnership estimates prices based upon current contracts in place, adjusted for basis differentials and market related information including published futures prices. The estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. If the carrying value exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future cash flows) and the carrying value of the assets. The determination of oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a subjective process and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary considerably from actual results. There were no impairments of proved oil and gas properties recorded by the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Partnership recognized a $160,644,700 asset impairment related to oil and gas properties, net of an offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income of $12,071,800. This impairment related to the carrying amount of these oil and gas properties being in excess of its estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2008. The estimate of fair value of these oil and gas properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas prices. Working Interest\nThe Partnership Agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to the MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions (\u201cworking interest\u201d).",
      "If the Company's cash flow from operations and available credit are not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements. Reliance on Estimates of Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flow necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary significantly. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves likely will vary from estimates, and such variances may be material. In addition, the Company's reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon production history, results of future development, oil and gas prices, performance of counterparties under agreements to which the Company is a party, operating and development costs and other factors. The PV-10 values referred to herein should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the Company's properties.",
      "As a result, the 2007 Net Profits Plan pool was the last pool established. Asset retirement obligations. We are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties. We base our estimate of the liability on our historical experience in abandoning oil and gas wells projected into the future based on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements. Our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties, assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates, and determine what credit adjusted risk-free rate to use. The impact to the consolidated statement of operations from these estimates is reflected in our depreciation, depletion, and amortization calculations and occurs over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties. Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets. Our property and equipment are recorded at cost. An impairment allowance is provided on unproven property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our proved properties and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be appropriate. Our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenues from property, using escalated pricing, with the related net capitalized cost of the property at the end of each period. When the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property, the cost of the property is written down to our estimate of fair value, which is determined by applying a discount rate that we believe is indicative of the current market. Our criteria for an acceptable internal rate of return are subject to change over time. Different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment. We recorded a $302.2 million impairment of proved oil and gas properties in 2008.",
      "We lease approximately 74,000 square feet of office space. Our current payment approximates $135,000 per month and our lease will expire in December 2014. Production During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, six months ended December 31, 2005 and fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 we have not had, nor do we now have, any long-term supply or similar agreements with governments or authorities under which we acted as producer. Impairment of Long Lived Assets\nOn a quarterly basis, we compare our historical cost basis of each proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas property to its expected future undiscounted cash flow from each property (on a field by field basis). Estimates of expected future cash flows represent management\u2019s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. If the expected future cash flows exceed the carrying value of the property, no impairment is recognized. If the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment exists and is measured by the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company recorded an impairment provision of approximately $58.4 million to developed properties primarily related to the Howard Ranch and Fuller fields in Wyoming ($37.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively), and the South Angleton field in Texas ($9.7 million), primarily due to lower Rocky Mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the Howard Ranch Prospect. During the year ended December 31, 2006, an impairment of $10.4 million was recorded on certain of our eastern Colorado properties primarily due to lower Rocky Mountain natural gas prices. In addition, an impairment of $1.0 million was recorded on certain Oklahoma properties. During the six months ended December 31, 2005, a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in Orange County, California. We determined that we would not pursue development in the prospect and accordingly an impairment of $1.3 million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect."

      "We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Every mining activity has an environmental impact. In order for a proposed mining project to be granted the required governmental permits, mining companies are required to present proposed plans for mitigating this impact. In the United States, where our properties are located, no mine can operate without obtaining a number of permits. These permits address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the operation and include numerous opportunities for public involvement and comment. We intend to focus on exploration and discovery of mineral resources.

      "Item 2 and Note 4 to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Impact of Year 2000 - ------------------- The General Partner and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, the General Partner's ultimate parent (together, John Hancock) along with the Partnership, have developed a plan to modify or replace significant portions of the Partnership's computer information and automated technologies so that its systems will function properly with respect to the dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. The Partnership presently believes that with modifications to existing systems and conversions to new technologies, the year 2000 will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems. However, if certain modifications and conversions are not made, or are not completed timely, the year 2000 issue could have an adverse impact on the operations of the Partnership. John Hancock as early as 1994 had begun assessing, modifying and converting the software related to its significant systems and has initiated formal communications with its significant business partners and customers to determine the extent to which John Hancock's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues. While John Hancock is developing alternative third party processing arrangements as it deems appropriate, there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Partnership's systems rely will be converted timely or will not have an adverse effect on the Partnership's systems. The Partnership expects the project to be substantially complete by early 1999. This completion target was derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, including availability of certain resources and other factors. However, there can be no guarantee that this completion target will be achieved. Forward-looking Statements - -------------------------- In addition to historical information, certain statements contained herein contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
      "Some of the older computer programs utilized by PSI were written without regard for Year 2000 issues and could cause a system failure or miscalculations with possible disruption of operations. Each of these computer programs and systems has been evaluated to be upgraded or replaced as part of PSI's Year 2000 project. The cost of the Year 2000 project will be allocated to all entities that use the PSI computer systems. The cost of the Year 2000 project which is expected to be allocated to the Partnership is approximately $96,000. The cost of new software will be capitalized and the cost of maintenance to existing systems will be expensed as incurred. The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1999 which is prior to any anticipated impact on operating systems. PSI believes that with modifications to existing software and, in some instances, the conversion to new software, the Year 2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems. However, if such modifications are not made, or are not completed timely, the Year 2000 issue could have a material impact on the operations of the Partnership. The costs of the project and the date on which PSI believes it will complete the Year 2000 modifications are based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events. There can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.\nITEM 2. Properties. ----------- The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1997 about properties owned by the Partnership. Thirty of these properties were acquired jointly with PSI and were contributed to a general partnership comprised of the Partnership and PSI. The weighted average occupancy level for the mini-warehouse facilities was 91% in 1997 compared to 90% in 1996. The monthly average realized rent per square foot for the mini-warehouse facilities was $.64 in 1997 compared to $.62 in 1996. Substantially all of the Partnership's facilities were acquired prior to the time that it was customary to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions.",
      "We believe that such modification and replacements are not significant, and should such modification and replacements be delayed there would be no material impact on our operations. We are approximately 85% complete with the assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the Year 2000. To date, cost estimates for upgrades for those systems not in compliance total approximately $200,000. After the assessment phase is completed, we will have to purchase, install and test the upgrades to ensure they meet internal Year 2000 compliance. We expect to complete our internal Year 2000 readiness program in the third quarter of 1999. We are in the process of asking our significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with us (external agents) whether their systems are Year 2000 compliant. To date, we are not aware of any external agent with a Year 2000 Issue that would materially impact our results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. However, we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be Year 2000 ready. The inability of external agents to complete their Year 2000 resolutions to process in a timely fashion could materially impact us. We currently have no contingency plans in place in the event we do not complete all phases of the Year 2000 program. We plan to evaluate the status of completion in second quarter of 1999 and determine whether such a plan is necessary. Pharmaceuticals Risk Factors\nDEPENDENCE ON COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\nWe expect to seek collaborative agreements to develop and commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates. We may not be successful in negotiating or entering into such agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, and any agreement, if entered into, may be unsuccessful. The research and development efforts in our diabetes program and, to a lesser extent, in our other programs, have been dependent upon arrangements with Lipha/Merck and Ono and their funding for research and development efforts thereunder.",
      "We remain subject to risks associated with the Year 2000 readiness problems of third parties, especially providers of products and services that are critical to our ability to conduct our business operations, including other telephone service providers with which our service connects. We are also aware that governmental authorities and third parties in the markets where our subsidiaries and our affiliates operate with whom we may have material business relationships may not be at the same level of awareness, or assessment or remediation of their potential Year 2000 readiness issues as are their United States counterparts. If any of these third parties or we are unable to resolve material Year 2000 readiness issues on a timely or cost-effective basis, there would be an adverse effect on us. 12. NEXTEL INTERNATIONAL'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM CURRENT BELIEFS. A) \"SAFE HARBOR\" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995: A number of the statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not historical or current facts, but deal with potential future circumstances and developments. Those statements are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding expectations generally, and also may materially differ from our actual experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas. We have attempted to identify, in context, some of the factors that we currently believe may cause actual experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area.",
      "The following table reflects the composition of the Company's restructuring reserve, the expenditures applied against it, and the portion of the reserve that was reversed at December 31, 1999:\nYEAR 2000 ISSUES\nAlthough we have not experienced any material problems related to Year 2000 issues, we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues, which may disrupt our operations. Year 2000 computer issues concern the inability of computer systems to accurately calculate, store, or use data after December 31, 1999. These computer issues may cause our computer systems, or those of our business partners, to process financial and operational information incorrectly. We have taken action over the past year to identify and correct these problems. We believe that our internal systems were Year 2000 compliant at December 31, 1999 and, to date, we have not experienced any problems related to Year 2000 issues. It is possible, however, that we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues in the next several months. We cannot assure that our operations have not been, or will not be affected by Year 2000 issues in a manner that has not become apparent to us or that may arise in the future. If our efforts or the efforts of our business partners failed to adequately address Year 2000 issues, we could incur costs to correct affected systems. While our Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve additional costs, we believe that these costs would not have a material impact on our financial results. The Company incurred third-party costs of approximately $50,000 related to Year 2000 issues. EFFECTS OF INFLATION Substantially all of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices."

      "As at October 28, 2009, mineralization identified by trenching and drilling, spread out over an approximately 975 m east-west distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil trend, appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence. Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides. Drilling highlights include granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut) including 10.0 m grading 33.15 g/t gold uncut (10.95 g/t gold cut) in drill hole KBRC09060 and 76.0 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 20.0 m grading 3.36 g/t gold (and including 5.25 g/t gold over 9.0 m) in hole KBRC09068.

The virgin ore and/or tailings are referred to herein as \"gold ore.\" The gold ore from the SSGM open-pit is loaded onto 20-25 ton dump trucks for transport to the SCMP. Trucks then haul the gold ore approximately 15 miles from the SSGM. Mine employees are responsible for the mining activities including the determination of areas to be excavated, trucking and loading operations, head sampling and sample analysis. The gold ore is received at the SCMP where it is weighed, logged, and sampled. Weighing is performed utilizing a conveyor belt scale and/or a truck scale located on the SCMP site. The excess gold ore is then unloaded at the SCMP site and stockpiled in an area which was developed to allow storage of more than 15,000 tons. SSGM gold ore is transferred from the stockpile to a feed bin utilizing a rubber-tired wheel loader. The feed bin has a capacity of approximately 10 cubic yards (13.5 tons).

    "documentation": [
      "The principal property area is situated within the Pararui Intrusive Suite. To the immediate west the Pararui Suite is in faulted contact with the later Maloquinha Intrusive Suite, and the Maloquinha Intrusive suite is in faulted contact with the Creporizao Intrusive Suite, further to the west. The Pararui Suite and the Creporizao Intrusive Suite play host to the vast majority of hard rock gold deposits and occurrences within the Tapajos gold Province. The property area is dominated by a series of regional N to NNW trending regional faults, and these orientations are also noted at mine scale as seen in the mineralized quartz veins within the property area. Historically the Santa Isabel property focused mining activities on the alluvial deposits within the many tributaries, and progressed to include saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins. S\u00e3o Domingos\nLocation and access\nThe Sao Domingos property lies in the Tapajos Province of Para State, Brazil. It is situated approximately 250 km SE of Itaituba, the regional centre, and includes an area of nearly 8000 ha. Small aircraft service Itaituba daily and on this occasion flights were sourced via Manaus. Access from Itaituba to site is by small aircraft or unsealed road of average to poor quality. The road is subject to seasonal closures and as the visit was at the end of the \u2018wet\u2019 season site access was granted via light aircraft utilizing the local airstrip. Tenure\nThe project covers an area of 6.100 hectares and was granted in 1995 as exploration license number 859.587/1995 and 850.990/1995 to 851.019/1995 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Mineral, and expires in 2012. These licenses were restructured by adding further applications and reductions of some areas under option. Currently the Company has tenure over Processo Nos 850.782/2005, 850.119/2006, 850.684/2006, 859.1995/1995. For ease of reference please see the map below. Option Agreement\nThe S\u00e3o Domingos option agreement allowed us to perform geological surveys and assessment work necessary to ascertain the existence of possible mineral deposits which may be economically mined and to earn a 100% interest in the S\u00e3o Domingos property mineral rights via structured cash payments.",
      "The option agreement has been cancelled. Geology\nThe property is located within the highly prospective Parauari Intrusive Suite, which is the host of several gold deposits and showings within the Southern Tapajos. Limited lithological inspection has shown the area is host to mineralized quartz veins. Similar to the Sao Domingos property, the dominant North and NNW structures are thought to represent relicts of the original mineralizing event. Preliminary investigation of the property area has confirmed the existence of mineralized quartz veins and stockwork systems within these Intrusive Granite Suites. We conducted an initial rock chip sampling program over an area recently being excavated for free gold in alluvial systems and the weathered granitic overburden via water canon and sluice. The sample results demonstrate that the quartz vein systems are highly mineralized and can be traced across the river valley for at least 200m.\nSanta L\u00facia - agreement cancelled\nLocation and access\nAccess to the property area is by light aircraft direct to the property or by river utilizing the Surubim River, a tributary of the Tapajos, which connects to the Amazon and to all major ports and the seaport of Belem. Road access is by the Trans Garimpeiro Highway via the Trans Amazon highway and ferry river crossings. Tenure\nThe project covers an area of 1.600 hectares and was granted in 1993 as exploration license number 854.001/1993 to 854.032/1993 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Mineral, and expires in 2102. Memorandum of Understanding\nThe Santa L\u00facia MOU provided us with a 90 day review period to access the gold potential of the property. If we decided to proceed with acquiring a 100 percent interest in the title to the mineral rights then we would have given notice to the vendors of our intention to acquire title to the mineral rights at least five days prior to the expiration of the aforementioned period. We would then have entered into an option agreement with the property vendors for the assignment and transfer of the mineral rights.",
      "The vendor will have a 1.5% Net Smelter Royalty. The Royalty payment can be purchased at any time upon written notice to the vendor and payment in Reals (Brazilian currency) of the equivalent of USD $1,000,000. The option agreement can be terminated at any time upon written notice to the vendor and we will be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Geology\nThe prime targets for the S\u0103o Jo\u0103o property are located around and on the intersection of regional NW and NNW faults within the Pararui Intrusive Suite and this area has been the focus of large-scale alluvial workings. The Pararui Intrusive Suite has proven to host the vast majority of gold deposits elsewhere within the Tapajos Gold Province. We conducted a rock chip program over an area currently being excavated for gold in quartz systems via shallow underground workings. The sample results have demonstrated that the quartz vein systems are highly mineralized and considered continuous for at least 200m. We are confident that the quartz vein systems are much more extensive and are currently planning to increase the sample density of rock and soil sampling over, and adjacent to, the current workings to locate further mineralized vein systems, and to drill test their depth extensions in the near future. Previous mining activity over a number of years focused on the alluvial deposits within its many tributaries, and has now progressed to include the saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins. Comandante Araras - Samba Minerals farm in agreement\nIn May 2008 we signed an agreement with Samba, which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the Comandante Araras projects by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, we will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property.",
      "Geology\nThe geology of the S\u0103o Domingos property is predominantly composed of paleo-proterozoic Parauari Granites that play host to a number of gold deposits in the Tapajos Basin. Typical Granites of the younger Maloquinha Intrusive Suite have been noticed in the vicinity of Molly Gold Target, and basic rocks considered to be part of the mesoproterozoic Cachoeira Seca Intrusive Suite occur around the Esmeril target area. The S\u0103o Domingos property was a previous large alluvial operation, and the property area covers numerous areas of workings. S\u0103o Jo\u0103o - Samba Minerals farm in agreement\nIn May 2008 we signed an agreement with Samba Minerals Limited (\u201cSamba\u201d), which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the S\u0103o Jo\u0103o project by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, we will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest in the property to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property. Samba can terminate its participation by providing us 30 days notice in writing. Upon withdrawal from its participation, Samba would forfeit to us all of its rights in relation to the project and would be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Samba will be the manager of the S\u0103o Jo\u0103o project. A feasibility study has not been completed as of April 15, 2011 and thus no joint venture has been formed as of that date. Location and access\nThe Sao Joao property is located in the central portion of the Southern Tapajos basin and is accessed by light aircraft from the regional centre of Itaituba. Access is also possible by unsealed roads linking up to the Transgarimpeiro highway and by a purpose cut heavy vehicle access track linking Sao Joao to the exploration centre at the primary project at Sao Domingo. Tenure - S\u0103o Jo\u0103o Project - DNPM Processes 851.533/94 to 851.592/94 inclusive:\nThe company has good title over the mineral rights which were granted in 1994 and 2005 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produ\u00e7\u0103o Mineral, as DNPM Process numbers 851.533/94 to 851.592/94 and which are valid and in force, free and clear of any judicial and extrajudicial encumbrances and taxes.",
      "Numerous production shafts are located on the flanks of the hills, trending along a major property scale east/west fault and we are confident of the potential for further mineralisation at depth. Preliminary investigations proved the local topographic highs to be part of the Parauari Intrusive Suite with well-developed stock work quartz. Initial inspection of the quartz veins showed them to be clearly mineralized and final results of initial sampling confirmed high grades of gold, up to 42.56g/t Gold with 20g/t silver within the quartz stock works. Locally, previous shallow, up to 10 meter production shafts focused on an E-W sub-vertical, project scale brittle structure, which can be traced for several hundreds of meters, and is thought to link up to the high grade occurrences at the Molly Gold Target project a distance of approximately 5 km. Esmeril was the centre of recent mining activity targeting the highly oxidised fraction of the porphyritic host rock. The stockwork veins, exposed by previous workers, show boxwork and fresh sulphides and generally associated with ferruginous staining of both the veins and the enclosing country rock. The Molly Gold Target area was also the centre of a large-scale development of both the alluvials and oxidised host rocks, using the common water canon and sluice method. This area is also located on an East - West structure and further investigations are underway to test if this structure forms part of the East - West system leading from Atacadao giving a strike potential of several km. Property scale dominant structures are all generally East -West. Within the project area the main structures strike NE-SW to E-W. Nearly all documented quartz veins and vein rock zones run parallel to this general tectonic trend suggesting the mineralisation is frequently related to the fracturing of the host rocks. Gold, silver, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, millerite, malachite and azurite are common minerals found within the rocks of the project area."

We retained a small metallurgical R&D lab in August 2006 to assess the potential for a modified fire assay technique that we believe is more appropriate for the material from the El Capitan deposit. Throughout 2007 investigations into the potential use of various industry-standard fire assay techniques to estimate the metal content of the El Capitan mineral samples were conducted. Such standard fire assay techniques produced limited improved results, and beginning in early 2008 and through early 2009, we conducted research into other assay techniques, including leaching, acid dissolution, and the addition of various precious metal collecting agents during the assay process. In early 2009, we completed these research analytical projects at the commercial laboratory and small, R&D-oriented facility we had contracted with. The results obtained were encouraging but resulted in inconsistent tests results. In May 2009, we received results from a commercial lab for additional assay tests. These assay tests conducted were comparable to the test procedures used in December 2008. The gold values indicated average gold grades of .032 ounces per ton, which were similar to the December 2008 values, representing recoverable values using standard extraction techniques. The assay tests also indicated average silver grades of 1.25 ounces per ton, equating to an average gold equivalent of .05 ounces per ton.",
      "These results are consistent with the values initially found by our independent consultants using similar methods. However, further research and testing led to the development of a caustic fusion protocol, a thiosulphate leach process and, more recently, a modified fire assay method that did extract economically significant values of gold and silver as \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d, from samples where conventional fire assay, aqua regia leach and cyanide leach extracted very low values. The best assay of any geological sample is by quantifying the extracted metal. That is why we and our consultants rely only on extracted gold and silver as \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d for reporting assay results. Both the caustic fusion and the thiosulphate leach provide \u201cmetal-in-hand\u201d and, together with the quality assurances and quality controls of the drill program, we and our consultants are confident of the results that we have reported. Pilot and Bench Scale Leach Test Results In the first quarter of 2009, AuRIC conducted a pilot scale leach test on 1,738 pounds of material extracted from our Permitted Mine Area by Arrakis under chain of custody protocols. No mineral processing operations, such as crushing, grinding, drying or screening, were performed on the sample prior to leaching. The material was analyzed using a caustic fusion technique and reported head grades of 0.055 ounces per ton (opt) gold (Au) and 0.520 opt silver (Ag). The material was then leached, resulting in the extraction of 0.047 opt Au and 0.464 opt Ag into solution. The precious metals were subsequently collected on resins and processed to produce Au and Ag bullion, for a net extraction of 0.038 opt Au and 0.385 opt Ag. This represents leach extraction of 86.2% of Au into solution and 69.1% of Au recovered as metal. This also represents leach extraction of 89.2% of Ag into solution and 74% of Ag recovered as metal. The overall extraction was 0.043 opt AuE. Upon completion of the test, the precious metal beads were delivered to us. In the second quarter of 2009, AuRIC conducted bench scale leach tests on composite drill samples taken from Zone B Central by McEwen."

    "question": "Given the potential for environmental liabilities associated with oil and gas operations, which of the following scenarios presents the LEAST risk to AEP System companies?",
    "choices": [
      "A) AEP System companies are identified as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) for four federal sites, including CSPCo at two sites and I&M at two sites, but management estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs.",
      "B) AEP System companies comply with all applicable environmental regulations, including obtaining permits and adhering to disposal requirements for hazardous wastes.",
      "C) OPCo settles its alleged liability at a Federal EPA-identified CERCLA site under a consent decree, but AEP System companies continue to dispose of PCB-containing electrical equipment.",
      "D) AEP System companies implement robust response plans, training, and drill programs for oil handling and storage facilities, as required by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA)."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "OPA imposes substantial penalties for failure to comply. AEP companies with oil handling and storage facilities meeting the OPA criteria have in place required response plans, training and drill programs. Solid and Hazardous Waste\nSection 311 of the Clean Water Act imposes substantial penalties for spills of Federal EPA-listed hazardous substances into water and for failure to report such spills. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) expanded the reporting requirements to cover the release of hazardous substances generally into the environment, including water, land and air. AEP's subsidiaries store and use some of these hazardous substances, including PCBs contained in certain capacitors and transformers, but the occurrence and ramifications of a spill or release of such substances cannot be predicted. CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws provide governmental agencies with the authority to require clean-up of hazardous waste sites and releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek compensation for damages to natural resources. Since liability under CERCLA is strict, joint and several, and can be applied retroactively, AEP System companies which previously disposed of PCB-containing electrical equipment and other hazardous substances may be required to participate in remedial activities at such disposal sites should environmental problems result. OPCo is the only AEP System company which is a defendant in a cost-recovery lawsuit related to clean-up liability at a Federal EPA-identified CERCLA site. OPCo settled its alleged liability at this site under terms of a consent decree and is awaiting formal dismissal from the case. AEP System companies are identified as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) for four additional federal sites, including CSPCo at two sites and I&M at two sites. Management's present estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs for identified sites for which AEP subsidiaries have been declared PRPs or are defendants in CERCLA cost recovery litigation.",
      "Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation, storage, transfer, and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA, however, excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes \u201cdrilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, gas, or geothermal energy.\u201d Because of this exclusion, many of our operations are exempt from RCRA regulation. Nevertheless, we must comply with RCRA regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the RCRA exclusion. The OPA \u201890 and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. OPA \u201890 establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d While OPA \u201890 liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water, at least one district court has held that OPA \u201890 liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters. Stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future, such as proposals made in Congress and at the state level from time to time, that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as \u201chazardous wastes\u201d and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal, and clean-up requirements.",
      "In order to comply with these statutes and regulations, the leaseholders of the oil and gas properties in which we hold working interests were required to obtain permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties being imposed upon the leaseholders, which in turn could negatively affect our profitability. Environmental Regulations\nThe drilling and production operations of oil and gas properties are affected by various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act. The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal of \u201chazardous substances\u201d found at such sites. It is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of \u201csolid waste\u201d and \u201chazardous waste\u201d and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of \u201chazardous substance,\u201d state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as \u201cnon-hazardous,\u201d such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. Generally, environmental laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment or the disposal of waste materials, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment.",
      "Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for\nnon-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution. Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in the us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set out in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in the Company being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties. CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as \u201cSuperfund\u201d laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a \u201chazardous substance\u201d into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, gas and natural gas liquids from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the exemption will be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any. RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes.",
      "These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), RCRA and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and natural gas wastes. Under such laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. CERCLA and similar state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a \"hazardous substance\" into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the\nhazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Company's operations may be subject to the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") and comparable state and local requirements. Amendments to the CAA were adopted in 1990 and contain provisions that may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of the Company. The EPA and states have been developing regulations to implement these requirements. The Company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues."
