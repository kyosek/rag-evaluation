      "Item 2. Properties\nProperty Overview\nOur oil and gas operations are concentrated in various North American onshore areas in the United States and Canada. We also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. As previously mentioned, we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets. Our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions. These interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region in north Texas. These assets include approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued development and growing production in the Woodford Shale, located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a capacity of 200 MMcf per day. Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This 220-mile dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal near Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline. The following sections provide additional details of our oil and gas properties, including information about proved reserves, production, wells, acreage and drilling activities."

The estimated reserves for the underlying properties are then used by XTO Energy to calculate the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the net profits interests. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserve volumes and values, and such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original estimates. Reserve quantities and revenues for the net profits interests were estimated from projections of reserves and revenues attributable to the combined interests of the trust and XTO Energy in the subject properties. Since the trust has defined net profits interests, the trust does not own a specific percentage of the oil and gas reserve quantities. Accordingly, reserves allocated to the trust pertaining to its 80% net profits interests in the properties have effectively been reduced to reflect recovery of the trust's 80% portion of applicable production and development costs, excluding overhead."

      "The principal property area is situated within the Pararui Intrusive Suite. To the immediate west the Pararui Suite is in faulted contact with the later Maloquinha Intrusive Suite, and the Maloquinha Intrusive suite is in faulted contact with the Creporizao Intrusive Suite, further to the west. The Pararui Suite and the Creporizao Intrusive Suite play host to the vast majority of hard rock gold deposits and occurrences within the Tapajos gold Province. The property area is dominated by a series of regional N to NNW trending regional faults, and these orientations are also noted at mine scale as seen in the mineralized quartz veins within the property area. Historically the Santa Isabel property focused mining activities on the alluvial deposits within the many tributaries, and progressed to include saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins. São Domingos\nLocation and access\nThe Sao Domingos property lies in the Tapajos Province of Para State, Brazil. It is situated approximately 250 km SE of Itaituba, the regional centre, and includes an area of nearly 8000 ha. Small aircraft service Itaituba daily and on this occasion flights were sourced via Manaus. Access from Itaituba to site is by small aircraft or unsealed road of average to poor quality. The road is subject to seasonal closures and as the visit was at the end of the ‘wet’ season site access was granted via light aircraft utilizing the local airstrip. Tenure\nThe project covers an area of 6.100 hectares and was granted in 1995 as exploration license number 859.587/1995 and 850.990/1995 to 851.019/1995 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral, and expires in 2012. These licenses were restructured by adding further applications and reductions of some areas under option. Currently the Company has tenure over Processo Nos 850.782/2005, 850.119/2006, 850.684/2006, 859.1995/1995. For ease of reference please see the map below. Option Agreement\nThe São Domingos option agreement allowed us to perform geological surveys and assessment work necessary to ascertain the existence of possible mineral deposits which may be economically mined and to earn a 100% interest in the São Domingos property mineral rights via structured cash payments."

      "In October 2000, Newmont and Buenaventura unitized their land holdings in northern Peru, folding them into Minera Yanacocha. The unitization increased Minera Yanacocha's land position from 100 to 535 square miles. Five open-pit mines, four leach pads, and two processing plants are in operation at Yanacocha. Gold sales for 2001 totaled 1.91 million ounces (983,100 equity ounces) at a total cash cost of $115 per ounce. Production from the La Quinua deposit commenced in the fourth quarter of 2001. By 2003, production from La Quinua is expected to reach one million ounces per year at an average total cash cost of approximately $125 per ounce. Exploration at Minera Yanacocha is focused on further definition of covered oxide deposits and deeper copper/gold sulfide systems. Additional oxide mineralization was found during 2001 at Corimayo, on the western edge of La Quinua. Bolivia\nThe Kori Kollo open pit mine is on the high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., of which Newmont has a 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Zeland Mines, S.A. Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. In 2001, the mine sold 312,300 ounces (274,800 equity ounces) of gold, while total cash costs declined 21% from 2000 to $158 per ounce.\nBrazil and Chile\nNewmont also has interests in two operating mines in Brazil and one in Chile. See the TVX Normandy discussion on page 21 below for more details. Australia\nPrior to our acquisition of Normandy , we owned a 50% interest in the Pajingo (Vera/Nancy) Mine discussed below. The remaining 50% interest in Pajingo (Vera/Nancy), and all other Australian properties described in this report, were acquired as part of our acquisition of Normandy. Kalgoorlie\nThe Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed and run by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds 50%."

      "Younger granitic intrusions occur and there is evidence of mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusive bodies (gabbroic or diorite). North of the Mashonga Mine the Igara rocks are covered unconformably by Buhweju Group quartzites and conglomerates of the MesoProterozoic Karagwe-Ankolean System. North-south trending fold axes from isoclinal folded sequences are reported as well as N-S and E-W trending structures (shears?). The drainages in the mine area trend southeast, suggesting there is a regional structure parallel to this. The Buganda-Toro and Karagwe-Ankolean systems have been extensively folded into tight synclines and anticlines, with upright axial planes and, in the southern and central Mashonga area, the former has been intruded by synorogenic porphyritic gneissic adamellites to post-orogenic biotite-bearing alkaline granites and leucocratic, sub-alkaline, per-aluminous granites (“tin granites”). Historical economic Sn, tungsten (“W”), beryllium (“Be”), niobium (“Nb”)/tantalum (“Ta”) deposits occur in similar rocks to the south of the Mashonga Property, hosted within the metasediments on the periphery of the granites. The presence of\n\t\t\t\tabundant quartz veining, several gold occurrences and the Sn-W-Be-Ta mineralization in this environment support the typical hydrothermal and epithermal activity of the Intrusive-Related Gold model driving the exploration. Informal gold production from the Mashonga Mine is reported to come from an east-west trending sheared quartz-vein zone. The mineralized shear appears to be hosted by quartz-muscovite schist, at the contact between the schist and granitic rock. The wallrock of the mine pit, much of which is now filled by slumped material, is comprised of schist and kaolinitized granite with pegmatitic veins and quartz stockwork veining. In addition a quartz-mica schist that may be a recrystallized mafic (or ultramafic) rock was observed by Magnus and the author of the Mashonga Technical Report on the mine dumps that are reported to come from the pit/underground workings."

      "The gold impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the processing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process. Capital costs for mine, mill, and tailings pond construction can, depending upon the size of the operation, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation. Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million-dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting permits, to ensure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies. Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects."

These facilities are fueled by coal, which is provided through various length contracts with several coal companies. We are evaluating additional generation which will provide adequate generating capacity reserves through the year 2000. Currently, we have capacity options for the years 2001-2007. Because the cost of capacity has risen significantly and also because of the reduced availability of capacity in the future, NorthWestern Public Service is developing a comprehensive plan to assure that it has sufficient capacity to meet customer needs and the reserve requirements of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (`MAPP'). Capability and Demand\nAs of December 31, 1998, the aggregate net summer peaking capacity of all NorthWestern Public Service-owned electric generating units was 308,289 kw, consisting of 104,420 kw from Big Stone (our 23.4% share), 42,700 kw from Coyote (our 10.0% share), 54,169 kw from Neal (our 8.7% share), and 107,000 kw from internal combustion turbine units and small diesel units, used primarily for providing electric power during peak demand periods. In addition to those plant facilities, we have entered into agreements to purchase up to 14,950 kw of firm capacity from Basin Electric Cooperative and various amounts from Nebraska Public Power District to assist in meeting peak demands. We are a summer peaking utility. The 1998 peak demand of 276,976 kw occurred on July 14, 1998. Total system capability at the time of peak was 333,589 kw. The reserve margin for 1998 was 20%. The minimum reserve margin requirement as determined by the members of the MAPP, of which we are a member, is 15%. MAPP is an area power pool arrangement consisting of utilities and power suppliers having transmission interconnections located in a 9-state area in the north central region of the United States and in two Canadian provinces."

      "thereafter\nFaults control alteration and mineralization in volcanics. Targets would be deeper than tested to date. Other companies drilled 122 shallow holes. Contact District\nAllied Nevada, through the acquisition from Vista of the F. W. Lewis, Inc. properties, owns wholly or in fractional interest 110 patented claims in the Contact mining district in northeast Elko County, Nevada. We also staked 307 unpatented claims adjacent to the patented claims in early July 2007. There are no royalties associated with our ownership of both the patented and unpatented mining claims. The small settlement of Contact is located approximately 52 miles north of Wells, Nevada and 16 miles south of Jackpot, Nevada. The mining district is immediately west of the town of Contact and extends for several miles west and southwest of town. The mining district, referred to as either the “Contact” or “Salmon River” district, was discovered in the early 1870s and was first worked for gold and silver. However, copper was soon discovered and the vast majority of the historic work in the district has been directed toward the development and production of copper ores. Early work in the district was hampered by the inaccessibility of the area and the resultant high shipping costs for any ore produced. The later construction of the railroad eliminated this problem, but falling copper prices in the 1930s caused the district to cease production. The district saw a renewed period of activity in the 1940s and early 1950s, but little true exploration work was done and most efforts were directed toward mining already known ore deposits. More recently, various companies have looked at the district for precious metals in the 1980s and 1990s, and higher copper and molybdenum prices have recently renewed interest in those prospects. Geology\nThe area is underlain by a granodiorite batholith and related rocks of Mesozoic age which intruded a Late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of shale and limestone. Contact metamorphism and metasomatism produced skarns and hornfels in the sediments up to a mile away from the contact zone."

      "The Ahafo mine operates on three mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Ahafo to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 13 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana. The Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu is progressing towards future laybacks. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and thirty-eight 141-tonne haul trucks. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of five underground loaders and eight haul trucks, each with a 60-tonne payload. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The processing plant was commissioned in 2006 to process 7.5 million tonnes of primary and oxide ore per year. With the depletion of oxide ore, the current plant throughput has decreased to 6.5 million tonnes per year. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, carbon in leach tanks, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit and a tailings disposal facility. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, an ongoing development project, will expand the existing plant by approximately 3.5 million tonnes per year through the installation of a new crusher, a single stage SAG mill and two leach tanks."

      "Mine Exploration\nIn-fill core drilling was conducted at the Buenavista zinc-copper-silver deposit, including directional drilling for geotechnical purposes. A deep drilling campaign was initiated in 2011 to explore the extent of the deposit at depth, drilling a total of 3,860 meters in 2012. For short-term mine planning, 6,652 meters were drilled to confirm copper grade and metallurgical recoveries. Also, in 2011, a condemnation drilling program was initiated to define areas for future infrastructure, as well as areas where leach and waste dumps will be deposited. A total of 28,369 meters of core drilling were completed in 2011. A geohydrology program was initiated in 2011 to explore the possibility of groundwater sources within the mine limits, and a total of 29,750 meters of diamond drilling were drilled in 2012. In addition, 3,797 meters were drilled for water monitoring wells. We did not have a drilling campaign in 2013. In 2014, we performed a drilling program of 20,000 meters in order to verify the reserves. For 2015, we plan to drill 15,000 meters to define reserves and to confirm copper and molybdenum grades. Concentrator\nBuenavista uses state-of-the-art computer monitoring systems at the concentrator, the crushing plant and the flotation circuit in order to coordinate inflows and optimize operations. Material with a copper grade over 0.38% is loaded onto trucks and sent to the milling circuit, where giant rotating crushers reduce the size of the ore to approximately one-half of an inch. The ore is then sent to the ball and bar mills, which grind it to the consistency of fine powder. The finely ground powder is agitated in a water and reagents solution and is then transported to flotation cells. Air is pumped into the cells producing a froth, which carries the copper mineral to the surface but not the waste rock, or tailings. Recovered copper, with the consistency of froth, is filtered and dried to produce copper concentrates with an average copper content of approximately 27%."

      "G&M has incurred $5,275,916 in exploration costs, commencing January 1, 1994 through September 30, 2013, and the Company has incurred $4,217,702 in exploration costs, from its inception on July 26, 2002 through September 30, 2013. The foregoing exploration costs include those costs associated with drilling, assaying, filing fees, extraction process development, consultant, geological, metallurgical, chemist, environmental and legal fees, and other miscellaneous property development costs. The following describes the Company’s historical extraction and analysis of samples from the El Capitan Property. Over the years, samples taken on the El Capitan Property, including samples taken by ECL, have given low-grade precious metal results when using standard fire assay methods. Through August 2006, due to the unique nature of the mineralization of the El Capitan Property, we have at times utilized testing and assaying methods that may be uncommon, including the use of alkali fusion assays, a more aggressive form of assay which completely converts the sample into a water soluble salt. In January 2005, ECL completed a preliminary 32-sample surface sampling and assay program on the El Capitan Property to determine the property’s gold and platinum potential. This preliminary sampling was completed by Dr. Clyde L. Smith, Ph.D. This preliminary sampling and assay program was followed by three stages of diamond drilling and rotary drilling, totaling 45 holes between April 2005 and September 2006. In 2007, ECPN engaged Dr. Smith to prepare a report to “provide an explanation of the work conducted on the El Capitan Gold-Platinum Project ... and to summarize the results of the geologic investigations ...” In this report, dated April 16, 2007, Dr. Smith states, “This resource [the El Capitan Property] qualifies as a ‘measured resource’ based upon the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 guidelines. Preliminary hydrometallurgical extraction results indicate potentially acceptable levels of recovery of both gold and platinum.”"

      "Decreased reserves in the Permian Clearfork area were primarily the result of a negative price revision. The Permian Abo area consists of 1,667 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Terry and Cochran Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Abo area comes from wells in the Kingdom Abo field, which primarily produce from the Abo formation. In 2011, a waterflood pilot program was implemented in the North West Terry Abo unit (“NWTA”) located in the Kingdom Abo field that converted one producing well to an injection well. Boaz Energy fully converted the field to water injection upon purchasing the NWTA in June 2016, and in January 2017 installed a new injection pump that added an additional injection capacity of 2,500 barrels of water per day. In August 2017, NWTA 313 demonstrated initial waterflood response.

    "documentation": [
      "Since 2013 the most important work conducted consisted of continued access road construction and metallurgical testing. All work performed by us, Cominco, and Nexa was done by direct employees of the respective companies with the exception of the drilling, underground tunneling, helicopter services and road building, all of which were performed by third-party contractors under the direction of Cominco and Nexa. 6. Mineralization\nMineralization occurs as massive to semi-massive replacements of sphalerite and galena localized by specific sedimentary facies (rock strata) within the limestone stratigraphy and by structural feeders and karst breccias. More than three-quarters of mineralization is sulfide-dominant with the remainder being oxide-dominant. A total of 11 preferred beds for replacement mineralization have been located within the middle unit of the Chambara Formation. Mineralization is associated with the conversion of limestone to dolomite, which creates porosity and permeability within the rock formations, promoting the passage of mineralizing fluids through the rock formations forming stratigraphically controlled near-horizontal manto deposits. Drilling of stratigraphic targets has shown that certain coarser-grained facies of the stratigraphy are the best hosts for manto mineralization. Stratigraphically controlled mineralization is typically one to several meters in thickness, but often attains thicknesses of five to ten meters. The laterally extensive manto deposits are strongly related to, and potentially originate from, structurally controlled near-vertical conduits for mineralizing solutions. Replacement deposits occur along these high-angle structures as well as in the stratigraphic mantos at Florida Canyon. Karst features are localized along the feeder faults and locally produce \"breakout zones\" where mineralization may extend vertically across thick stratigraphic intervals where collapse breccias have been replaced by ore minerals. Mineralized karst structures are up to 50 meters in width (horizontal), up to 100 meters vertically, and up to hundreds of meters along strike."

Foxwood owns the 220 unit Foxwood Apartments in Memphis, Tennessee. Woodsong owned the 190 unit Woodsong Apartments in Smyrna, Georgia. ARI guaranteed a minimum 12.0% return annually based on the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return, ARI was required to pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the assets failed to produce the 12.0% return for a calendar year and ARI failed to pay the shortfall, TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities for the original purchase price. Because ARI guaranteed the 12.0% return and TCI had the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, management classified the consideration paid as a note receivable from ARI. In July 2002, the Woodsong\nIndex to Financial Statements\nApartments were sold. ARI received $2.8 million from the proceeds as payment of principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the note receivable. In October 2003, TCI sold One Hickory to IORI for $12.2 million, less prorations, for a wraparound promissory note of $12.0 million. This note bears interest at 5.49% interest, requires monthly interest and principal payments and matures in June 2006. This transaction effectively discharged the note receivable TCI had from ARI for the financing of One Hickory. Also, in November 2003, Confederate Point sold the Confederate Apartments and paid $2.1 million to TCI to pay off the loan and accrued but unpaid interest. In April 2005, the guaranty period ended and TCI completed the purchase of the Foxwood Apartments by recording the asset and removing the note receivable from ARI. In December 2003, TCI purchased a note receivable secured by a second lien on 33 acres of raw land in Travis County, Texas at par value from ARI for $2.4 million as a paydown on an affiliate loan balance."

While our board of directors may terminate or amend the incentive plan at any time, no amendment may adversely impair the rights of grantees with respect to outstanding awards. In addition, an amendment will be contingent on approval of our stockholders to the extent required by law. Unless terminated earlier, the incentive plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date on which it was approved by our stockholders, after which no further awards may be made under the incentive plan, but will continue to govern unexpired awards. Summary Compensation Table We consummated the SSSI Acquisition on January 23, 2006 and, as a result, we conducted operations for only one week of Fiscal 2005. As a result, individual compensation information paid by Stewart & Stevenson LLC to our named executive officers during that one week period is not material. The following table sets forth the compensation of our most highly compensated executive officers, which include our chief executive officer, for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2007. We refer to these individuals as our named executive officers. Equity Awards\nIn connection with the adoption and approval of the incentive plan and in anticipation of an initial public equity offering, the compensation committee of the board, which has the responsibility to administer the incentive plan, made certain grants of restricted shares to the Company’s non-executive directors (Ms. Ansary and Messrs. Carlucci, Crystal, Kemp, Macomber and Solarz and until April 2008, Mr. Zarb) and certain members of the Company’s senior executive management (Messrs. Hargrave and Merecka)."

      "Officers of Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates do not and will not be required to spend any specified percentage or amount of their time on the Company's business. Since these shared officers function as both the Company's representatives and those of Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, conflicts of interest could arise between Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its shareholders, on the other. Government Regulation\nThe Company's business is subject to certain federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the drilling for and production, transportation and marketing of oil and gas, as well as environmental and safety matters. Such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in recent years, often imposing greater liability on an increasing number of parties and in some circumstances creating retroactive liability. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is unable to predict the effect or cost of compliance with such requirements or their effects on oil and gas use or prices. In addition, legislative proposals are frequently introduced in Congress and state legislatures which, if enacted, might significantly affect the oil and gas industry. In view of the many uncertainties which exist with respect to any legislative proposals, the effect on the Company of any legislation which might be enacted cannot be predicted. Hedging Activities\nThe Company utilizes energy swap arrangements and financial futures to reduce sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility. If the Company's reserves are not produced at the rates estimated by the Company due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process, operational difficulties or regulatory limitations, the Company will be required to satisfy obligations it may have under fixed price sales or hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production."

      "N/A: Not Available\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(1) Loans are returned to performing status after a reasonable period of sustained performance and the borrower's financial condition has improved to a point where doubt as to repayment of principal and interest no longer exists. (2) Represents net activity for assets with a carrying value generally less than $250 thousand. Prior period amounts have been restated for a change in reporting classification to exclude loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing. (1)During 1993 the Corporation redefined its industry categories from Standard Industrial Classification codes to internally developed definitions which are based on the primary market in which the borrower operates. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSS Provisions are made to the allowance for possible loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level considered by management to be sufficient to provide for risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses involves a disciplined quarterly analysis. The analysis ensures that all relevant factors affecting loan collectability are consistently applied. The analysis of the allowance relies mainly on historical loss ratios, current general economic and industry trends, and the current and projected financial condition of certain individual borrowers. Specific allocations of the allowance are assigned to individual loans where serious doubt of full principal repayment exists. General allocations of the allowance are assigned to the remaining portfolio primarily on the basis of historical loss factors. The historical loss factors are determined on the basis of past charge-off experience identified by portfolio type and, within each portfolio type, identified by risk rating. A migration analysis is utilized to support the calculation of the allowance and evaluate the overall reasonableness. Management believes the allowance for possible loan loss at December 31, 1993, is adequate based on the risks identified in the various loan categories."

      "GSWL also owns and operates the Hwini-Butre and Benso mines located 80 km and 50 km, respectively, south of Wassa. In 2008, following completion of a 50 km haul road, we started mining at Benso and began hauling its ore to Wassa for processing. In May 2009, following completion of a 30 km road extension, the Hwini-Butre mine began trucking ore to the Wassa processing plant. The Benso and Hwini-Butre mines include multiple open pits at both locations as well as mining equipment, equipment repair shops, warehouses and other ancillary support equipment and buildings. Mining was completed at Benso in February 2012. Mining is expected to continue at Hwini-Butre through mid-2014. Geology at Wassa\nWassa lies within the Eburnean Tectonic Province in the West African Precambrian Shield. The Proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the West African craton and host the major gold mineralization in Ghana are subdivided into meta-sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Birimian and Tarkwaian sequences. Wassa is hosted within the same Birimian volcano-sedimentary greenstone package as Bogoso/Prestea. However, Wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the Ashanti Belt while Bogoso and Prestea occur along the northwestern flank. The volcano-sedimentary sequence hosting the Wassa deposit has been affected by four deformational events spanning across the Eoeburnean (age 2.1-2.2 billion years) and Eburnean orogeny (age 2.1 billion years). The associated gold mineralization which has developed during the earlier Eoeburnean deformational event and subsequently deformed during the Eburnean event has\nresulted in a complex re-folded vein system at the Wassa mine. During the Eoeburnean deformation, a series of tight isoclinal folds and a strong fabric marked by chlorites, ankerite, and gold-bearing elongated pyrite was developed along with numerous quartz-ankerite veins. The gold-bearing veins along with the early isoclinal folds were re-folded along a large-scale synform during the Eburnean event. The early isoclinal folds control the distribution of high grade mineralization at depth which have been intercepted by the deep drilling program and will continue to be the main focus of the 2013 Wassa exploration program."

      "The State Engineer exercises jurisdiction over underground water basins with \"reasonably ascertainable boundaries.\" Accordingly, new appropriations or changes in purpose or place of use or points of diversion of existing water rights, such as those in the San Juan and Gallup Basins where the Company's properties are located, must be obtained by permit from the State Engineer. Applications are required to be published and are subject to hearing if protested. There are three criteria for decision, that the application: (1) not impair existing water rights, (2) not be contrary to the conservation of water within New Mexico, and (3) not be detrimental to the public welfare. Applications may be approved subject to conditions that govern exercise of the water rights. Appeals from decisions of the State Engineer are to the district court of the county in which the work or point of desired appropriation is situated and from there to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Finally, jurisdiction over water rights may become an issue in New Mexico when an Indian nation, such as the Navajo Nation, objects to the State Engineer's authority to grant or transfer a water right or to award a temporary water right, claiming tribal jurisdiction over Indian country. This issue could result in litigation between the Indian nation and the state which may delay action on water right applications, and, depending on who prevails as to any particular property, could result in a requirement to make applications to the appropriate Indian nation and continuing jurisdiction by the Indian nation over use of the water. All of the foregoing issues arise to a greater or lesser extent in connection with the Company's New Mexico properties. There can be no assurance that the regulatory permits or licenses in Texas or New Mexico, or the applications for water rights in New Mexico, required for any project of the Company will be approved by the necessary governing authority in the form contemplated by management, or in any other form, or within the time periods necessary to commence timely production."

      "The Corona Property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. (\"WCRM\"), an affiliate of the Company. WCRM charges the Company 3% of the gross rents collected as a management fee, as allowed by the Property Management Agreement. Property taxes in the first full year of operations which are the obligation of the tenant, are estimated at approximately $19,000 (approximately 1% of the sales price). Total consideration paid by the Company for the Corona Property was $1,896,949. This cost includes the $1,800,000 sales price payable to the Seller, approximately $20,000 in legal, appraisal, and closing costs, and an $94,000 acquisition fee payable to the Advisor. In addition, $92,000 was received from the Seller in the transfer of prepaid rents. The sale was paid for from the proceeds resulting from the sale of the Company's shares in the current offering. The purchase price was determined through an arms-length negotiation with the Seller. The total cost of $51.11 per square foot is comparable to recent sales in the area for similar properties. Four sales were surveyed and the price per square foot ranged from $48.00 to $57.37, with the weighted square foot average being $51.42. Considering the state of the recovering economy in the area and the long term lease in place with a relatively stable and desirable tenant, the price paid for the Property is considered reasonable. The computation of depreciation for the Corona Property is based on the cost of the property, including Acquisition Fees and Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the Property to various asset categories is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation will be computed on a straight-line basis over 39 years, the estimated component useful life of the assets.

      "Initial oil production from the first expansion at Tengiz was achieved in 2007 with activities ongoing to complete the project. Construction of the initial phase of the Kashagan field continued during 2007. Index to Financial Statements Russia\nExxonMobil’s net acreage holdings at year-end 2007 were 0.1 million acres, all offshore. A total of 3.0 net development wells were completed in the Chayvo field during the year and Phase 1 drilling activities are continuing. Full-field production (Phase 1) began in the fourth quarter 2006. Phase 1 facilities include an offshore platform, onshore drill site for extended-reach drilling to offshore oil zones, an onshore processing plant, an oil pipeline from Sakhalin Island to the Russian mainland, a mainland terminal and an offshore loading buoy for shipment of oil by tanker. WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION\nAt year-end 2007, exploration activities were underway in several areas in which ExxonMobil has no established production operations and thus are not included above. A total of 45 million net acres were held at year-end 2007, and 1.0 net exploration wells were completed during the year in these countries. Information with regard to mining activities follows:\nSyncrude Operations\nSyncrude is a joint-venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods, to extract the crude bitumen, and to produce a high-quality, light (32 degree API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The Syncrude operation, located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, mines a portion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Deposit. The location is readily accessible by public road. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the Syncrude site to Edmonton, Alberta by Alberta Oil Sands Pipeline Ltd. Since start-up in 1978, Syncrude has produced about 1.8 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint-venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. Operating License and Leases\nSyncrude has an operating license issued by the Province of Alberta which is effective until 2035."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval. The plan is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning. Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC. The Companies are unable to predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds to the Companies for the Companies’ bondholders. Environmental Matters\nVarious federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on the Companies with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position. These environmental regulations affect FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that it competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and therefore do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such regulations. Overall, FirstEnergy believes it is in compliance with existing regulations but is unable to predict future change in regulatory policies and what, if any, the effects of such change would be. FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $430 million for 2005 through 2007, which is included in the $3.3 billion of forecasted capital expenditures for 2005 through 2007. Clean Air Act Compliance\nThe Companies are required to meet federally approved SO2 regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $32,500 for each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging period."

      "Great South Land Minerals Limited has made submissions supporting its case to the Minister on both occasions and has no reason to believe that Special Exploration License 13/98 should be revoked. Should the Minister attempt to revoke the license, which is effectively a contract between the company and the Government, this action would be vigorously defended and damages caused as consequence of commercial destabilisation would be sought. The Terrex Seismic trucks have completed 271 line kilometers of seismic onshore Tasmania from March 2007. In addition, a Competent Persons Report has been written to comply with our intended fund raising efforts, along with a geophysical assessment and compilation of the target structures. Together with our ongoing regional gravity survey, we believe this clearly demonstrates to the Government, our shareholders and the Tasmanian public, our commitment to fulfill all conditions precedent for a commercial discovery into production. Great South Land Minerals Limited and its predecessor companies have spent substantial amounts on exploration activities. These activities have so far established the presence of two petroleum systems, the Larapintine Petroleum System and the Gondwana Petroleum System. In identifying these petroleum systems, Great South Land Minerals Limited has proved the presence of quality source world class source rocks, including the Tasmanite Oil Shale which is the richest oil and gas source rock and is used as the world standard for type 1 kerogen, that are thermally mature for the generation of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. This determination shows that hydrocarbons have been generated, expelled and migrated into potential reservoir units. Although recent seismic data has shown the potential for trapping mechanisms, the Company is undertaking additional gravity and seismic work to identify potential drill targets. Great South Land Minerals Limited continues its exploration activities with exploration drilling & stratigraphic coring activities being planned in strategic locations."

As a result, we have little control over the operations of those wells and this lack of control can act to increase our risk. Operators of these wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests. Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, production from oil and natural gas properties declines as oil and natural gas reserves deplete, with the rate of decline depending on the reservoir characteristics of each producing\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwell. Unless we successfully replace the oil and natural gas reserves that we produce, our oil and natural gas reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in our oil and natural gas production, revenues and cash flow from operations. Historically, we have succeeded in increasing oil and natural gas reserves after taking production into account. However, we may not be able to continue to replace our oil and natural gas reserves in a manner consistent with our past history. Low prices of oil and natural gas also limit the kinds of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically develop. Lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures. Our natural gas gathering and processing operations involve numerous risks that may result in the failure to recover our cost in the natural gas gathering and processing facilities. The cost of developing the gathering systems and processing plants is substantial and uncertain. Our operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of many things beyond our control, including:\n•\nunexpected changes in the deliverability of natural gas reserves from the wells connected to the gathering systems;\n•\navailability of connecting pipelines in the area;\n•\nequipment failures or accidents;\n•\nadverse weather conditions;\n•\ncompliance with governmental requirements;\n•\ndelays in the development of other producing properties within the gathering system’s area of operation; and\n•\ndemand for natural gas and its constituents."

      "In a typical hedging transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference. The Company would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether the Company's production was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. In addition, the index used to calculate the floating price in a hedge is frequently not the same as the prices actually received for the production hedged. The difference (referred to as basis differential) may be material, and may reduce the benefit or increase the detriment caused by a particular hedge. There is not an established pricing index for hedges of California heavy crude oil production, and the cash market for heavy oil production in California tends to vary widely from index prices typically used in oil hedges. Consequently, prior to 2000, hedging California heavy crude oil was particularly subject to the risks associated with volatile basis differentials. In February 2000, the Company entered into a 15-year contract, effective January 1, 2000, to sell all of its current and future California crude oil production to Tosco Corporation. The contract provides pricing based on a fixed percentage of the NYMEX crude oil price for each type of crude oil that Nuevo produces in California.

      "Accordingly, there is a risk that reserves model based on total copper values may have over-estimated the amount of recoverable copper. (See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Company”). Data Verification\nFour different major categories or levels of data verification have been completed at Johnson Camp Mine by Cyprus Copper, Arimetco, Summo, and others in evaluating the geological, drill hole, and assay database. Each major category or level of data verification provides a measure of confidence in the database. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that taken in aggregate, all four categories provide corroboration and thus a higher degree of confidence in the data. The categories include: individual inter-company verifications; intra-company verifications; third party reviews; and reconciliations. Inter-Company Verifications\nCyprus conducted drilling and assaying with both internal and external check assay procedures for data verification. Cyprus had samples assayed at more than one external lab for both total copper and acid-soluble copper. Those external labs were reputable commercial analytical labs commonly employed by the mining and exploration industry at the time. A quality assurance quality control, or QA/QC, procedure was also in place whereby Cyprus composited sample pulps and re-submitted the composite for assay as a comparison with the average of individual assays. In addition, Cyprus did bottle roll tests on core samples to provide an additional analysis for comparison. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concluded that, while these procedures were not done for every hole and every sample, they were done in sufficient amount to detect either errors in the analytical process or high variability in assays as a result of the geology and no significant or consistent variances were noted. The majority of the drill holes in the resource database are core holes drilled by Cyprus. Arimetco drilled with core and by reverse circulation methods. Although Arimetco did not have the same quantity of internal or external check assays as Cyprus, Arimetco made extensive use of an independent, reputable commercial lab."

      "D) The mineralization zone is likely to be oriented at a 30° angle to the southwest slope of Grassy Mountain, which is covered by silicified arkose landslide debris."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Several siliceous terraces are interbedded with the silicified sediments of the Grassy Mountain Formation. Terrace construction was apparently episodic and intermittently inundated by fluvial/lacustrine sediments and ash, resulting in an interbedded sequence of siltstone, tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, and sinter terrace deposits. Proximal deposits are angular, inhomogeneous, clast-supported breccias of sandstone, siltstone, and sinter with indistinct clast boundaries in a sulfidic mud-textured matrix. Grassy Mountain is a prominent, 150 feet high, silicified and iron-stained knob. Bedding is approximately horizontal at the hilltop, and dips at 10° to 25° to the north-northeast on the northern and eastern flanks of the hill. The bedding dip steepens to 30° to 40° on the west side of the hill due to drag folding in the footwall of the N20W striking Antelope Fault. The southwest slope of Grassy Mountain is covered by silicified arkose landslide debris. Grassy Mountain is a horst block which has been raised 50 to 200 feet in a region of complex block faulting and rotation. Faulting at Grassy Mountain is dominated by post-mineral N30W to N10E striking normal faults developed during Basin and Range extension. On the northeast side of the deposit, these faults progressively down-drop mineralization beneath post-mineral cover. These offsets are suggested by interpreted offsets of a prominent white sinter bed in drill holes as well as intersections with fault gouge. The N70E striking Grassy Mountain Fault shows minor vertical offset of only 10 to 40 feet. The surface expression of the Grassy Mountain system is indicated by weak to moderately strong silicification and iron staining with scattered chalcedonic veins/veinlets. Approximate dimensions of the Grassy Mountain deposit are 1600 feet long by 1000 feet wide by 600 feet thick. The deposit has a general N70 E elongation and a 15° bedding plane dip to the north-northeast as a result of faulting and fault block rotation. There is an envelope of lower grade mineralization at depths of 200 to 800 feet which contains a higher-grade zone of mineralization between 500 and 750 feet below the surface."

      "A total of 36 drill holes totaling 4,621 meters have thus far tested three principal target areas: the Colonia, Patoa and Tucanare prospects. At the main Colonia trend, a mineralized east-west structure has been traced by drilling for about 500 meters. This trend remains open in both directions along horizontal strike and at depth. Of the two holes drilled this year at the new Jamil prospect in the southern part of the Colonia area, one contained 10.4 meters of 8 g/t gold. The one hole drilled in another completely new area, Dorado, in the northern part of the Colonia area intersected 10.1 g/t over 2 meters. At Patoa, previously announced drill holes SB-04, that intersected 12.2 meters grading 12.2 g/t gold, and SB-18, that intersected 34 meters grading 2.7 g/t gold, may represent the same mineralized trend. In addition, SB-20, that contained 25.5 meters of 1.6 g/t gold, was drilled 600 meters west of the main Patoa area and represents significant untested potential of the Patoa zone. Finally, at the Tucanare prospect, all five drill holes have intersected gold mineralization. 8. Sampling and Analysis\nSoils were taken over large areas and analyzed by assay and by panning to aid in exploration. Auger samples up to 10 meters in depth were also taken in selected areas and analyzed similarly. Sawed core samples were transported from the drill to the camp by vehicle then by truck, boat or plane to the nearest population center where they were air transported to central Brazil for sample preparation at ALS Chemex Laboratories in Goianania or SGS Laboratories in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Final analysis for samples sent to ALS Chemex was completed in the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada or in Lima, Peru. <PAGE>\n9. Security of Samples\nThe geologist in charge supervised the collection of samples on site and the shipping from the site to the point of air transport. Sample tracking by Solitario incorporated transport records and sample receipt by the laboratory in Brazil. Shipping outside of Brazil was supervised by the laboratory."

    "documentation": [
      "Four major mining methods were historically employed in the Mine. The oldest is square set or cut and fill. These methods employ support of the stope where the vein is mined with sets of timbers and/or rock bolts, and then sand-fill is pumped from the surface as the mining activity moves to a higher elevation. The broken ore was scraped into chutes by compressed air powered slushers and dropped into ore pockets on the level below. The second method called shrink stoping is similar to the above, but no ground support is required. Instead, the broken ore is used as both ground support and a mining floor and the full mining cut is completed prior to withdrawing the ore from the stope. Air powered slushers or compressed air operated mucking machines on rubber tires were historically used. A third mining method is known as room and pillar mining. In this operation, no timber is required but pillars of ore are left in place as supports until the stoping moves to a higher elevation, at which time sand fill is pumped in to provide the floor for the next cut. As the ore is broken, rubber tired, compressed air operated mucking machines picked it up putting it into a box on the back of the loader. It was then transported to a chute in the stope where it dropped into the ore pocket on a lower level. The fourth method is sublevel blasthole stoping. Diesel powered equipment cuts horizontal slices every forty feet in the ore zones. Then long holes are drilled in the pillars between horizontal slices. The holes are blasted allowing the ore to fall to the bottom slice and scooped up by diesel powered loaders and transported to ore passes. This method was used above the Kellogg Tunnel, and ore was transported by gravity to the tunnel and hauled out by train to the surface. From the ore pockets on the various levels of the mine below the Kellogg Tunnel, ore trains powered by battery driven locomotives transported the ore to ore pockets located at the shaft. In the shaft, large steel buckets, called skips, were loaded and hoisted to the Kellogg Tunnel level where the ore was dumped into two large concrete bins."

      "In addition, because snowboarding is a winter sport, sales of the Company's snowboard boots have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters. As the Company increases its international sales through VFEL and experiences changes in its product mix, it expects that its quarterly results will vary from historical trends. Therefore, the results of operations of any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, the Company's operating results fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis as a result of holidays, weather and the timing of large shipments. The Company's gross margins also fluctuate according to product mix, cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company's future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts. Historically, the Company has shipped a large portion of its products late in the quarter. Consequently, the Company may not learn of sales shortfalls until late in any particular fiscal quarter, which could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. TRADE CREDIT RISK The Company's results of operations are affected by the timely payment for products by its customers. Although the Company's bad debt expense has not been material to date, no assurance can be given that it will not increase relative to net sales in the future or that the Company's current reserves for bad debt will be adequate. Any significant increase in the Company's bad debt expense relative to net sales could adversely impact the Company's net income and cash flow, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay its obligations as they become due.

The building is located in Orange County, California, which has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in California, based on its stable base of employers ranging from big businesses to smaller retailers. The Building was originally acquired for cash in 1991 for a total acquisition cost of $1,676,210. In February 1994, the Company financed the Building by incurring mortgage debt secured by the Building for $600,000. The loan is amortized over a twenty-five year period and is due February 1, 2004. The monthly payment is currently $4,934 per month with a current interest rate of 8.25%. The building and improvements are depreciated over 31.5 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and income tax basis for the property are the same. In the opinion of the General Partner, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. (\"WCRM\" or \"the Property Manager\"), an affiliate of the Company. The building is 100% occupied by one tenant, Blockbuster Video, through 2001, on a triple net lease.

Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine\nWe currently have one Development Property, the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine, which we also refer to as the “Hycroft Mine” in this prospectus. This mine and related facilities are located 54 miles west of Winnemucca, Nevada. Winnemucca (population 15,000) is a commercial community on Interstate 80, 164 miles northeast of Reno, Nevada. The town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a small airport. Access to the Hycroft Mine from Winnemucca, Nevada is by means of State Road No. 49 (Jungo Road), a good-quality, unpaved road. Access is also possible from Imlay and from Lovelock by dirt roads intersecting Interstate 80. There is access to adequate supplies of water and power. In the past, the majority of employees lived in the Winnemucca area. The mine is situated on the eastern edge of the Black Rock Desert and on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains between Winnemucca and Gerlach, Nevada. There are no streams, rivers, or major lakes in the general area. Elevations in the mine area range between 4,500 and 5,500 ft above sea level. The climate of the region is arid, with precipitation averaging 7.6 inches per year."

    "question": "What is a critical factor that could contribute to temporary shutdowns at an operating ISR mine in the Burke Hollow area, based on the information provided?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The presence of a nearby population center that could supply the necessary number of mining personnel, but not the necessary electric power.",
      "B) The infrequent occurrence of freezing temperatures, which are generally quite brief and infrequent, and the abnormally heavy rainfalls that may affect the site area with heavy rain storms.",
      "C) The lack of sufficient electric power in the area, which may require new lines to be brought in to support the plant site and well fields.",
      "D) The presence of oxidation/reduction interfaces in the drill holes, which may indicate the presence of uranium mineralization, but not necessarily affect the operation of the mine."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "From June through September the normal high temperatures are routinely above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, while the months from December through February are the coolest with average low temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Periods of freezing temperatures are generally quite brief and infrequent. Tropical weather from the Gulf of Mexico can occur during the hurricane season and may affect the site area with heavy rain storms. The infrequent freezing weather and abnormally heavy rainfalls are the primary conditions that could cause temporary shutdowns at an operating ISR mine. The necessary rights for constructing the needed surface processing facilities are in-place on selected lease agreements. Sufficient electric power is believed to be available in the area, however new lines may be needed to bring additional service to a plant site and well fields. Within a 20-mile radius of the planned Burke Hollow facility there is sufficient population to supply the necessary number of suitable mining personnel. History\nThe earliest historic uranium exploration at the Burke Hollow Project was the drilling of five exploration holes completed on the Welder lease by Nufuels (Mobil) in 1982. Oxidation/reduction interfaces were intercepted in two of the holes and oxidized tails were logged in three of the holes. In 1993 Total Minerals conducted a short reconnaissance exploration drilling program and completed a total of 12 exploration holes of which 11 intersected anomalous gamma ray log signatures indicative of uranium mineralization. The resulting 12 log files include good quality electric logs, with each log file containing a detailed lithological report based on drill hole cuttings prepared by Total Mineral’s field geologists who were supervising and monitoring the drilling activity contemporaneously. All of the boreholes were drilled using contracted truck-mounted drilling rigs. The holes were drilled by conventional rotary drilling methods using drilling mud fluids. All uranium exploration at the Burke Hollow Project has been conducted with vertical drill holes."

    "question": "What is the primary reason for the Company's improved price realization on its natural gas sales compared to Henry Hub or other natural gas price indexes?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The Company's oil production is sold primarily under market-sensitive or spot price contracts, which allows it to benefit from the spot market prices of natural gas liquids.",
      "B) The Company's natural gas liquids are sold primarily based on spot market prices, which increases the resale price received by the purchaser and subsequently benefits the Company.",
      "C) The Company's keep-whole gas purchase contracts allow it to retain natural gas liquids and return residue gas to producers, which increases the value of natural gas liquids as a liquid compared to a portion of the residue gas stream.",
      "D) The Company's natural gas liquids are sold to purchasers under percentage-of-proceeds contracts, which allows it to receive a fixed percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "CGI generally receives between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and from 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from natural gas liquids sales. Under keep-whole gas purchase contracts, CGI retains all natural gas liquids recovered by its processing facilities and keeps the producers whole by returning to the producers at the tailgate of its plants an amount of residue gas equal on a BTU basis to the natural gas received at the plant inlet. The keep-whole component of the contract permits the Company to benefit when the value of natural gas liquids is greater as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream. OIL AND GAS MARKETING\nThe Company's oil and gas production is sold primarily under market sensitive or spot price contracts. The Company sells substantially all of its casinghead gas to purchasers under varying percentage-of-proceeds contracts. By the terms of these contracts, the Company receives a fixed percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The Company normally receives between 80% and 100% of the proceeds from natural gas sales and from 80% to 100% of the proceeds from natural gas liquids sales received by the Company's purchasers when the products are resold. The natural gas and natural gas liquids sold by these purchasers are sold primarily based on spot market prices. The revenues received by the Company from the sale of natural gas liquids is included in natural gas sales. As a result of the natural gas liquids contained in the Company's production, the Company has historically improved its price realization on its natural gas sales as compared to Henry Hub or other natural gas price indexes. For the year ended December 31, 1998, purchases of the Company's natural gas production by GPM Gas Corporation accounted for 11.5% of the Company's total gas sales for such period and for the same period purchases of the Company's oil production by Koch Oil Company accounted for 79.8% of the Company's total produced oil sales."

      "For the reserves PVR leases from third parties, PVR pays royalties to the owner based on the amount of coal produced from the leased reserves. Additionally, in some instances, PVR purchases surface rights or otherwise compensates surface right owners for mining activities on their properties. In 2007, PVR’s aggregate expenses to third-party surface and mineral owners were $5.5 million. The following table sets forth the coal reserves PVR owns and leases with respect to each of its coal properties as of December 31, 2007: The following table sets forth PVR’s coal reserve activity for each of its coal properties for the years ended December 2007, 2006 and 2005:\nPVR’s coal reserve estimates are prepared from geological data assembled and analyzed by PVR’s general partner’s or its affiliates’ geologists and engineers. These estimates are compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes, geophysical logs, adjacent mine workings, outcrop prospect openings and other sources. These estimates also take into account legal, qualitative, technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined. Coal reserve estimates will change from time to time due to mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geological data, acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings, modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors. PVR classifies low sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.0%, medium sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content between 1.0% and 1.5% and high sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 1.5%. Compliance coal is that portion of low sulfur coal that meets compliance standards for the CAA. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 26% of PVR’s reserves met compliance standards for the CAA and 39% were low sulfur. The following table sets forth PVR’s estimate of the sulfur content and the typical clean coal quality of its recoverable coal reserves at December 31, 2007:\n(1) Compliance coal is low sulfur coal which, when burned, emits less than 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTU."

      "This scenario is currently anticipated by our management to be the most reasonable course of action although there is no assurance that this scenario will be adopted. Scenario 4 - Development of existing offshore leases, using existing onshore facilities with additional capacity or adding new facilities to handle a relatively low rate of expanded development. This scenario is similar to #3 above, but would entail increased costs for any new facilities. Scenario 5 - Development of existing offshore leases, using existing onshore facilities with additional capacity or adding new facilities to handle a relatively higher rate of expanded development. Under this scenario we would incur increased costs but revenues would be received more quickly. The development plans for the various units (which have been submitted to the MMS for review) currently provide for 22 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 300 feet for the Gato Canyon Unit; 63 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 1,100 feet for the Sword Unit; 60 wells from one platform set in a water depth of approximately 336 feet for the Point Sal Unit; and 183 wells from two platforms for the Lion Rock Unit. On the Lion Rock Unit, Platform A would be set in a water depth of approximately 507 feet, and Platform B would be set in a water depth of approximately 484 feet.

      "Covered parking is provided. The average occupancy rates during 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, and 1991 were 99%, 99%, 99%, 97%, and 88%, respectively. The average rental rates for each of these same years were $716, $704, $688, $679, and $678, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 156 of the 164 Units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 95%. FINANCING\nIn December, 1992 the Partnership borrowed $2,500,000. The loan, secured by a first trust deed against Chandler Villas and guaranteed by the General Partners, bears interest at 5.25% in excess of the seven year treasury yield and all unpaid principal and interest is due on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 1995, the unpaid principal balance was approximately $2,443,000. COMPETITION\nBased on market surveys that conclude that 60% or more of the residents residing in a given facility come from within a 10-mile radius, the primary market for Chandler Villas may be defined by the following cities: Apache Junction, Bapchule, Chandler, Guadalupe, Laveen, Maricopa, Mesa, Ocotillo, Scottsdale, Sun Lakes, and Tempe. The total population of this primary market is 712,812 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications, California, 1996). Assuming that at least 8% of the total population is 65 years of age or older, approximately 57,024 seniors are residing within a 10-mile radius of Chandler Villas. The U. S. Census Bureau, in 1990, reported that 13% of the 65+ population constitutes the primary residential care market, equaling 7,413 seniors in Market Area 2. Currently, there are four facilities in Market Area 2 offering services and features similar to Chandler Villas. These facilities have a combined total of 615 units, potentially housing approximately 676 seniors, or about 9% saturation of the target market. The market may be expanded to 33% or less due to units rented by residents coming from the primary area. Market saturation is also increased by indirect competition from small board and care homes, minimum service senior apartments and residential facilities lacking assisted living services; such facilities are not included in the figures."

BNSF Railway’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF Railway’s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF Railway is now subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF Railway may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF Railway, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF Railway may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF Railway operations. Further discussion is incorporated by reference from Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone 3 and Seabrook I. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone 3 is $21.9 million in 1997 dollars, and Seabrook I is $13.7 million in 1997 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Millstone 3:\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone 3, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Subsidiaries of Northeast are the lead participants in Millstone 3. On March 30, 1996, it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone 3 and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee. (See \"Connecticut Yankee\" below.) In October 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it was establishing a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office is responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an Independent Corrective Action Verification Program (ICAVP), (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities. Also, the NRC directed Northeast to submit a plan for disposition of safety issues raised by employees and retain an independent third-party to oversee implementation of this plan."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it is continuing its efforts to reduce pipeline pressure which has shown potential for increasing production and extending field life in the Fontenelle Field. Potential development activities for the underlying properties in this area include:\n• installing artificial lift,\n• restimulating producing intervals utilizing new technology,\n• additional compression to lower line pressures, and • opening new producing zones in existing wells. XTO Energy markets the gas produced from the Fontenelle Unit and nearby properties under three different marketing arrangements. Under the agreement covering approximately 70% of the gas sold, XTO Energy compresses the gas on the lease, transports it off the lease and compresses the gas again prior to entry into the gas plant pipeline. The pipeline transports the gas to the gas plant, where the gas is processed, then redelivered to XTO Energy. The owner of the gas plant and related pipeline charges XTO Energy for operational fuel and processing. In 2008, the fuel charge was 1.86% of the volumes produced and the processing fee was approximately $0.11 per MMBtu. XTO Energy transports and sells this gas directly to the markets based on a\nspot sales price. The gas not sold under the above arrangement is sold either under a similar arrangement where the fee is $0.17 per MMBtu, or under a contract where XTO Energy directly sells the gas to a third party on the lease at an adjusted index price. Condensate is sold at the lease to an independent third party at market rates. Producing Acreage and Well Counts For the following data, “gross” refers to the total wells or acres on the underlying properties in which XTO Energy owns a working interest and “net” refers to gross wells or acres multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by XTO Energy. Although many of XTO Energy’s wells produce both oil and gas, a well is categorized as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of oil to natural gas production. Operated wells are managed by XTO Energy, while nonoperated wells are managed by others."

      "The feasibility study commissioned by Summo compared total historical production with the block model and found both tonnage and grade to be within 0.8% of the combined Cyprus and Arimetco production. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates has concluded that this is a close correlation between the historical production and the database-derived block model. Reconciliations between the current model and actual production in 2009 found a similar close correlation. Additional Third Party Review\nA third party consulting firm observed, and Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates concurred, that the basic information upon which verification relies is available for the Johnson Camp Property, including: pre-mine and post-mine mapping; drill hole geological logs; copies of daily drill reports; drill core sampling procedures (Cyprus); original or copies of original assay certificates from commercial analytical labs and the Cyprus Johnson Camp Mine lab; documented sample preparation and analytical procedures; standard analytical procedures used by laboratories, several vintages of geological maps, rock density procedures by an independent laboratory; blast hole pattern assay maps; production records as truck counts to leach dumps; actual production records (from blast holes) versus forecast production (from the deposit model); pre-feasibility and feasibility reports; current availability of geological personnel who actually performed some of the work; and a limited library of core samples and sample pulps. In 2006, we commissioned a third party consultant to review the applicability of the drill hole data base. Bikerman Engineering & Technology Associates reviewed the verification work done by the consultant and concurs with the conclusions of the consultant. In April 2006, the consultant visited the Johnson Camp Mine and prepared a spreadsheet summary listing all available drill hole data. The consultant tabulated the rotary, reverse circulation and core drilling done on the Burro and Copper Chief deposits."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "All of the uranium mining properties at Sheep Mountain are currently shut down with limited reclamation activities. Monitoring and reporting work continues to keep the permits current. There is no operating uranium mill near Sheep Mountain, but Rio Tinto owns the Sweetwater Mill (which is on standby) some 30 miles south of Sheep Mountain. The ultimate economics of mining the Sheep Mountain properties through underground working will depend on access to a mill. Over a period of at least 24 months, substantial work would be required to put the Sheep Mountain uranium mines into production, including permitting, cleaning rock and other debris from shafts and tunnels, pumping water out of the mines, extending shafts and tunnels, and further drill sampling to ascertain whether a commercially viable ore body exists on any of the properties. We have recorded reclamation liabilities for the Sheep Mountain properties (see note K to the consolidated financial statements). No historical costs from the Sheep Mountain properties are on the balance sheet of USE at December 31, 2006. Current permits are in place for standby maintenance and reclamation of the mines.\n· Arizona\nOn August 22, 2005, the Company and UPC signed an agreement to add two more uranium projects to their joint venture (Burro Canyon in Colorado and Breccia Pipes located in Arizona). The latter project involves properties in the Arizona Strip, in northern Arizona. This property consists of 54 lode mining claims (Star and Java claims) on BLM land in Mohave and Coconino counties, Arizona. The exploration targets on these properties are known as Breccia Pipes uranium deposits. These properties were acquired by the Company pursuant to an agreement with Nu Star Exploration, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement between the Company and UPC, UPC will earn a 50% interest in the project by contributing the first $500,000 in acquisition and exploration expenses for the project (but still, UPC will have to complete its payments under the Purchase and Sale Agreement generally, to hold the 50% interest in the project)."

      "PROPERTIES -- Power Supply) has developed its estimate of the cost of decommissioning its unit and has received the approval of FERC to include charges for the estimated costs of decommissioning its unit in the cost of energy which it sells. From time to time, these companies re-estimate the cost of decommissioning and apply to FERC for increased rates in response to increased decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee has filed a decommissioning financing plan under a Maine statute which requires the establishment of a decommissioning trust fund. That statute also provides that if the trust has insufficient funds to decommission the plant, the licensee (Maine Yankee) is responsible for the deficiency and, if the licensee is unable to provide the entire amount, the \"owners\" of the licensee are jointly and severally responsible for the remainder. The definition of \"owner\" under the statute includes Montaup and may include companies affiliated with Montaup. The applicability and effect of this statute cannot be determined at this time. Montaup would seek to recover through its rates any payments that might be required (see Yankee Atomic, below). Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Unit 1. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone Unit 3 is $15.1 million in 1993 dollars, and Seabrook Unit 1 is $10.6 million in 1993 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Yankee Atomic:\nOn February 26, 1992, Yankee Atomic announced that it would permanently cease power operation of Yankee Rowe and began preparing for an orderly decommissioning of the facility. Montaup has a 7.8 MW entitlement from the plant and has a 4.5% equity ownership in Yankee Atomic with a book value of approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 1993."

      "On September 30, 2013 we released the results on column leach testing by an independent laboratory and announced our intention to issue a revised PEA based on a heap leach operation designed to produce approximately 2,500 tons per year of heavy rare earth elements plus yttrium. The column leach testing results are described in greater detail below under the section heading “Properties - Round Top Project - Metallurgy”. On December 23, 2013, we published a revised version of the June 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “Revised PEA”) based on a 20,000 tonne per day heap leach operation using a conventional element separation plant. The mineralized material estimate was recalculated to include uranium, niobium, tantalum and tin. The Revised PEA assesses the potential economic viability of the simplified and \"scaled down” operation which we believe is a much better fit with the present rare earth market. Cautionary Note to Investors: The PEA and Revised PEA have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. The Company has voluntarily had the PEA and Revised PEA prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 but the Company is not subject to regulation by Canadian regulatory authorities and no Canadian regulatory authority has reviewed the PEA or Revised PEA or passed upon its accuracy or compliance with NI 43-101. The terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority."

Exploration expenditures in excess of $250,000 in any year can be accumulated and carried forward and credited to expenditures required in succeeding years. We have fulfilled the work commitment on the Lookout Mountain project. During the year ended September 30, 2012, we acquired the Windfall Patents. The claims were acquired in exchange for $400,000 cash as well as 919,935 shares of our common stock with a value of $500,000, based upon the weighted average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE MKT during the 15 days prior to the acquisition.

By being a working interest owner, we are responsible for the payment of our\nproportionate share of the operating expenses of the well. Royalty owners and over-riding royalty owners receive a percentage of gross oil production for the particular lease and are not obligated in any manner whatsoever to pay for the costs of operating the lease.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "Uranium mineralization at the Anderson Project occurs exclusively in the sequence of Miocene-age lacustrine lakebed sediments. The lacustrine sediments unconformably overlie the andesitic volcanic unit over most of the Anderson Project. However, to the east of the Anderson Project, they overlie the felsic to intermediate volcanic unit. Evidence suggests that deposition of the lacustrine sediments occurred in a restricted basin less than 5 km wide by 10 to 12 km long on the northern edge of an old Paleogene lake. Moving southward, these sediments inter-tongue with siltstones and sandstones. The lakebed sediments represent time-transgressive facies deposited within a narrow, probably shallow, basinal feature. This type of depositional environment exhibits complex relationships between individual facies, lensing out, vertical and horizontal gradation, and interfingering. The lake sediments include green siltstones and mudstones, white calcareous siltstones, and silty limestone or calcareous tuffaceous material. Much of this material is silicified to varying extents and was derived in part from volcanic ashes and tuffs common throughout the lakebeds. Also present in the lacustrine sequence are zones of carbonaceous siltstone and lignitic material. Along the boundary between the former MinEx and Urangesellschaft properties, drill holes encounter the basal arkosic sandstone. To the south and southwest, lakebeds interfinger with and eventually are replaced by a thick, medium to coarse-grained, arkosic sandstone unit. Mineralization\nUranium mineralization in outcrops and the pit floor at the old Anderson mine was reported by the US Bureau of Mines in Salt Lake City as tyuyamunite (Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2·5-8H2O). Carnotite (K(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O) and a rarer silicate mineral, weeksite (K2(UO2)2(Si2O5)3·4H2O), were also reported in outcrop samples. Carnotite mineralization occurs as fine coatings and coarse fibrous fillings along fractures and bedding planes and has been noted in shallow drill holes and surface exposures."

      "C) The potential for customer choice of generation suppliers to increase competition",
      "D) The utility's operating expenses, including operation and maintenance, depreciation, and taxes"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "A utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utility’s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (ii) such utility’s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. The rates of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCO’s base rates are capped, subject to certain adjustments, at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists in Virginia. Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes."

      "The zone is gold bearing. The trench interval from 200 to 210 feet assayed 0.048 opt gold and 0.5 opt silver. The interval from 240 to 250 feet contained 0.076 opt gold and 2.6 ounces silver. The adjacent interval from 250 to 260 feet assayed 0.017 opt gold and a half-ounce silver. The eastern margin of trench JTP-2, located 400 feet north of Trench JTP-3, averaged 0.028 opt gold and 0.67 opt silver from 10 to 60 feet. Within this zone, the interval from 50 to 60 foot assayed 0.087 opt gold and .71 opt silver. New information from Kernow Resources\nDuring the summer of 2010, DGRI was able to track down information on the historic exploration done on the property. Key information, including historic drill cuttings and core, with partial assaying, was graciously given to DGRI by Kernow Resources. DGRI was told that eleven of approximately 20 permitted holes in the Jungo area were actually drilled during the 1990’s. DGRI is reviewing these cores and cuttings. Most of these holes were drilled to the west and east of DGRI’s target area because they were targeted on geophysical anomalies. DGRI is focused on apparently younger silicified volcanic vent materials that appear to be low in sulfides, and unlikely to form a strong geophysical signature. It appears that the previous explorers didn’t recognize the vent structures while they were focused on drilling the sulfide-related geophysical targets and a visibly copper-stained vein system. DGRI believes that at least two stages of mineralization occurred in the area. An earlier high-temperature period of mineralization was copper-rich, with limited gold and zinc accessory mineralization. This stage of mineralization had locally strong sulfides, and is likely associated with the geophysical targets. A later apparently lower temperature period of mineralization contains more gold and silver with lower sulfide content that was all oxidized in Dutch’s trenches. The earlier exploration was conducted during a time of lower, and dropping gold prices, and Kernow reportedly had money constraints for continued exploration."

      "BGE filed the manual in February, 1996. ELECTRIC RATE MATTERS ENERGY CONSERVATION SURCHARGE The PSC approved a base rate surcharge effective July 1, 1992 which provides for the recovery of deferred energy conservation expenditures, a return thereon, lost revenues, and incentives for achievement of predetermined goals for certain conservation programs subject to an earnings test. The compensation for foregone sales due to conservation programs and the incentives for achieving conservation goals must be refunded to customers if BGE is earning in excess of its authorized rate of return, as determined by the PSC. (See discussion in ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.) The surcharge is reset on July 1 of each year. ELECTRIC FUEL RATE PROCEEDINGS By statute, electric fuel costs are recoverable if the PSC finds that BGE demonstrates that, among other things, it has maintained the productive capacity of its generating plants at a reasonable level. The PSC and Maryland's highest appellate court have interpreted this as permitting a subjective evaluation of each unplanned outage at BGE's generating plants to determine whether or not BGE had implemented all reasonable and cost effective maintenance and operating control procedures appropriate for preventing the outage. The PSC has established a Generating Unit Performance Program (GUPP) to measure annual utility compliance with maintaining the productive capacity of generating plants at reasonable levels by establishing a system-wide generating performance target and individual performance targets for each base load generating unit. As a result, actual generating performance, after adjustment for planned outages, is compared to the system-wide target and, if met, should signify compliance with the requirements of Maryland law. Failure to meet the system-wide target will result in review of each unit's adjusted actual generating performance versus its performance target in determining compliance with the law, and the basis for possibly imposing a penalty on BGE."

      "It is anticipated that all potential water needs for the Round Top project mine operations would be satisfied by the existing wells covered by this water lease. This lease has an annual minimum production payment of $5,000 prior to production of water for the operation. After initiation of production we will pay $0.95 per thousand gallons or $20,000 annually, whichever is greater. This lease remains effective as long as the mineral lease is in effect. This well field was originally developed to supply water for a proposed real estate project in the late 1970’s. One of the existing wells is reported to have pump tested 950 gallons per minute and another 450 gallons per minute. This water is high enough in total dissolved solids to not meet drinking water standards, thus there is no competition for its use. The quality of the water is expected to be adequate for process water needs and the water will require treatment to be potable. Current and Planned Metallurgical Activities\nMetallurgical research done leading to the publication of our Revised PEA of December 2013 has shown the possibility of heap leaching at the Round Top Project. This first step of “dissolving” the REE bearing mineral is the critical factor in the determination to develop REE projects. The type of solvent, its strength and other conditioning necessary to render the elements soluble is, in our opinion, what most affects the ultimate feasibility of a project. TMRC has been able to extract a high percentage of the REE and other elements from the mineralized rock at the Round Top Project, and test work to date also indicates it can be done easily and at projected low operating costs. We are now at the stage of solution concentration and purifying. We have intended to carry this project forward as follows: Stage 1a, Treat the primary leach solution to remove the impurity elements and to produce a feedstock solution at concentrations and flow rate acceptable to feed the processing plant. 1b, Desktop study of the CAPEX and OPEX of the plant envisioned at Round Top."

      "PROPERTIES (Continued)\nReal Estate (Continued)\nby the general partner. In January 1992, the partnership stopped making payments on the first mortgage secured by the One East Penn Square Office Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An affiliate of the lender owned the remaining 45% limited partner interest. In May 1993, the lender filed a foreclosure action against One Penn Square. On October 6, 1993, the court appointed a receiver for the property. The lender also filed an action against the partnership and the Company to set aside, as a fraudulent conveyance, payments from the partnership to the Company in 1992 and in 1993 of $1.8 million made to repay the Company's mortgage note secured by a second lien on the One East Penn Square Office Building. In April 1994, the Company and the lender reached an agreement which provided that the Company pay $575,000 to the lender and convey the Company's interest in the partnership to the lender. In August 1994, the Company made the required $575,000 payment, conveyed its partnership interest to the lender and the parties executed mutual releases and all litigation between the parties was dismissed. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million as the carrying value of its investment in the partnership was less than the debt secured by the One Penn Square Office Building due to previously recognized equity losses. In March 1994, the Company sold its 50% general partner interests in Pilgrim Village Associates and Pilgrim Village Associates II to the co-general partner for $2.6 million in cash. The partnerships owned the Pilgrim Village Apartments I and II, respectively, in Canton Township, Michigan. The Company recognized a gain of $2.5 million on the sale. Effective January 1, 1995, the other 50% general partners in both Twinbrook Village Associates, which owns Twinbrook Village Apartments in Rockville, Maryland, and Gate Laurel Associates, which owns the Westgate of Laurel Apartments in Laurel, Maryland, conveyed their interests in the partnerships to the Company in exchange for a release from their general partner liability."

      "The settlement funds received by Alpha were incorporated in funds available to AOGC, through this wholly owned subsidiary, following completion of the Alpha purchase. The now remaining three permits of the Browse Joint Venture, WA-332-P, WA-333-P and WA-342-P are contiguous and are located offshore in the eastern Browse Basin. They cover a total area of 9,460 km(2) (2,336,620 acres). The Browse Basin region is a major proven hydrocarbon area and it forms a part of the extensive series of continental margin sedimentary basins that, together, comprise the North West Shelf hydrocarbon province of Australia. The Browse Basin has been host to a series of major gas, gas condensate and oil discoveries which began with the 1971 discovery at Scott Reef-1. The Browse Basin is currently the focus for two proposals to establish new LNG export facilities; one by Woodside Energy Ltd in relation to the Torosa/Brecknock/Calliance complex and the other by Inpex Corporation in relation to the Ichthys complex. Two of the Browse Joint Venture permits are presently lightly explored. There is one well on the boundary of WA-332-P (Prudhoe-1), one well in WA-333-P (Rob Roy-1), and a total of fourteen wells in WA-342-P, mostly associated with the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation. In the first three year term of the Permits, the Browse Joint Venture has obtained available open file reports and basic 2D and 3D seismic data acquired by the earlier efforts of previous explorers. This included approximately 1,100 km(2) of high quality 3D seismic known as the Cornea 3D survey which is held by the Browse Joint Venture. Approximately 1,000 km(2) of this 3D data set was reprocessed by the joint venture during the 2007 year. The 3D data set has been integrated with the acquisition and processing of the Braveheart 2D seismic survey. The Browse Joint Venture previously acquired the Braveheart seismic survey of approximately 1,949 line km of new 2D seismic survey over these Browse Joint venture permits. The Browse Joint Venture has elected to enter a second three year permit term in which it presently is planning for the drilling of Braveheart 1 in WA-333-P. Active geological and geophysical evaluation of all of the Browse Joint Venture Permits is continuing, with special studies having been carried out in respect to the undeveloped Cornea oil and gas accumulation (in WA-342-P) and the Braveheart project, which straddles both WA-332-P and WA-333-P.\nBrowse Joint Venture\nThe Browse Joint Venture, which comprises WA-332-P and WA-333-P, on March 19, 2008, applied for an 18-months suspension and extension of Year 5 of permit WA-332-P in order to acquire further new infill 2D seismic survey over potential leads in WA-332-P and to secure a drilling vessel."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Although ore production does not reach maximum capacity in some years, mining of higher grade ore in these periods with an increase in contained gold and silver ounces does somewhat offset the effect of the lower ore production. The average gold produced over years 2 to 11 is approximately 74,000 oz per year with a maximum of 99,000 oz in Year 8 of production. The average silver produced is approximately 781,000 oz per year over this same period, with a maximum of 1.27 million oz of silver in Year 4 of production. Waste rock mining ranges from a low of approximately 8 million tons (7.3 million tonnes) in Year 1 to a high of approximately 20 million tons (18.2 million tonnes) in Years 5 and 6. The variation in waste rock mining rates is driven by a combination of factors. The current mine production schedule seeks to take advantage of the available ore processing capacity limit of approximately 5.1 million tons (4.7 million tonnes) per year especially during the initial five years of the Project. This results in periods of very high waste production as zones with high mining ratios, i.e. waste tons:ore tons, must be mined in order to expose sufficient ore. In addition, the requirement to ensure the most efficient disposal of waste rock in mined-out phases of the open pits combined with the steep topography leads to truck haulage distances that can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The initial mine life is projected to be 12 years. Note that aggregate sales over a period of thirty years are important for the Project as this will ensure that GQM LLC can meet its closure and closing reclamation requirements. Ore-from-waste separation will require special attention to ensure that overall grade projections are met. Underground mine openings will be encountered from time-to-time during open pit mining and this will be allowed for in the detailed mine planning. Norwest reviewed and confirmed operating cost estimates for the open pit operation for the 2015 updated feasibility study."

      "Mr. Puchner is responsible for all aspects of the work, including the quality control/quality assurance program. The quality assurance/quality control program implemented by the Company meets or exceeds industry standards. A quality assurance/quality control program includes insertion of blanks and standards (1/10 samples) and duplicates (1/20 samples). Blanks help assess the presence of any contamination introduced during sample preparation and help calibrate the low end of the assay detection limits. Commercial standards are used to assess the accuracy of the analyses. Duplicates help assess the homogeneity of the sample material and the overall sample variance. The Company has undertaken rigorous protocols to assure accurate and precise results. Among other methods, weights are tracked throughout the various steps performed in the laboratory to minimize and track errors. A group of 2,096 metallic screen fire assays performed in 2011 did not indicate any bias in the matching fire assays. On-site Project personnel photograph the core from each individual borehole prior to preparing the split core. Duplicate RC drill samples are collected with one split sent for analysis. Representative chips are retained for geological logging. On-site personnel at the Project log and track all samples prior to sealing and shipping. All sample shipments are sealed and shipped to ALS Chemex in Fairbanks, Alaska, for preparation and then on to ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, or Vancouver, B.C., for assay. ALS Chemex’s quality system complies with the requirements for the International Standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:1999. Analytical accuracy and precision are monitored by the analysis of reagent blanks, reference material and replicate samples. Quality control is further assured by the use of international and in-house standards. Finally, representative blind duplicate samples are forwarded to ALS Chemex and an ISO compliant third party laboratory for additional quality control. Data entry and database validation procedures have been checked and found to conform to industry practices."

    "documentation": [
      "The remaining international operations, which include subsidiaries in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, are involved in the transportation of selected general and specialized commodities and are assigned to the HVP Division. The RS Division successfully completed its negotiations in the first quarter of 1992 to form a joint venture company known as UTS Europe Holding BV (UTS). The new entity, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, has been handling intra-European movement of household goods since March 1, 1992. NAVL has a 40 percent interest in UTS which is comprised of approximately 70 individual shareholders in 65 locations throughout Europe. To date, national and regional organizations have been formed under the UTS banner in Germany and the Netherlands (founding members), with an 8 percent and 5 percent interest in UTS, respectively. In addition, the United Kingdom (8 percent interest in UTS), Belgium (5 percent interest) and the Scandinavian countries (5 percent interest) have also formed under the UTS banner. TRIPLE CROWN OPERATIONS. Until April 1993, Norfolk Southern's intermodal subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCS), offered intermodal service using RoadRailer (Registered Trademark) (RT) equipment and domestic containers. RoadRailer(RT) units are enclosed vans which can be pulled over highways in tractor- trailer configuration and over the rails by locomotives. On April 1, 1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were transferred to Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC), a partnership formed by subsidiaries of Norfolk Southern and Consolidated Rail Corporation (CR). RoadRailer(RT) equipment owned or leased by TCS (which was renamed TCS Leasing, Inc.) is operated by TCSC. Because NS indirectly owns only 50 percent of TCSC (an affiliate of CR also owns 50 percent), the revenues of TCSC are not consolidated with the results of NS. TCSC offers door-to-door intermodal service using RoadRailer(RT) equipment and domestic containers in the corridors previously served by TCS, as well as service to the New York and New Jersey markets via CR."

      "The power for this property is diesel-generated on site. GEOLOGY\nThe Colomac orebody is hosted within a large quartz feldspar porphyry sill of the Pre-Cambrian age. It was later tilted into a vertically dipping orientation and has been named the Colomac Dyke. This intrusion was fractured and recemented by quartz veinlets containing free gold and pyrite. The Colomac Dyke averages 120 feet wide in the Zone 2.0 pit. It has a strike length of approximately 7 miles. The Main Zone occurs within a package of steeply dipping mafic pillowed volcanics. The gold occurs associated with enriched areas of sulphides. The Kim/Cass zone occurs within a steeply dipping mafic intrusive body. Gold occurs associated with swarms of quartz veinlets containing minor amounts of sulphides. ORE RESERVES Due to the suspension of operations in 1997, no portion of the Colomac dyke is included as part of mineable reserves. Similarly, none of the Kim/Cass property is included as part of mineable reserves and instead has been reclassified to the mineralized material category. GIANT MINE\nSELECTED OPERATING DATA\nBACKGROUND\nThe Giant Mine, located approximately three miles north of Yellowknife, has been in continuous production since 1948. The Ingraham Trail, a paved all-weather highway from Yellowknife passes through the center of the property. Mining is conducted underground and the ore is processed with an on-site mill. Since the commissioning of the mill in 1948, the Giant Mine has produced in excess of 7.6 million ounces of gold. In 1996 the Company completed rehabilitation of the infrastructure which accesses the Supercrest orebody and large scale mining of this orebody is currently taking place to supplement the ore from the main Giant orebody. The higher grade mineable ore from Supercrest averages 0.387 opt gold in situ compared to 0.301 ounces of gold per ton at Giant. The net book value of the Giant Mine property, plant and equipment was approximately $57.2 million as of December 31, 1997. The Nicholas Lake property, which was acquired in 1995 from Athabaska Gold Resources Ltd., is located 60 miles north of Yellowknife."

      "Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet. The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels.

Longer term, we can further expand the facility by another approximately 25,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 127,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 81,000 NRSF of raised floor. The Santa Clara facility is subject to a ground lease. We acquired a ground sublease interest in the land on which the Santa Clara facility is located in November 2007. The ground sublease expires in 2052, subject to two 10-year extension options. The current annual rent payable under the ground sublease is approximately $1.1 million, which increases annually by the lesser of 6% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay area. In addition, in 2018 and 2038, the monthly rent will be adjusted to equal one-twelfth of an amount equal to 8.5% of the product of (i) the then fair market value of the demised premises (without taking\ninto account the value of the improvements existing on the land) calculated on a per square foot basis, and (ii) the net square footage of the demised premises.

      "There was no exploration or definition drilling during 2018 due to the strike. Upon restart, definition drilling is expected to resume near the 6350-52 Ramp West, 6500 East Lateral, and 6500 Far East to test the 30 Vein and a portion of the 30 Vein offset by the Silver Fault. Drilling is also expected to refine the intermediate vein package at the 6500 level and upgrade 30 Vein resources on the eastern end of the deposit. These adjacent veins are roughly defined as intermediate veins which have become an increasingly significant component of the mine’s production mix within the life of mine plan. Exploration may resume on the far-east end of the Lucky Friday Extension deposit. The goal of this exploration drilling is to define vein extensions for the 30 Vein and intermediate veins. Based on current estimates of reserves and mineralized material, the currently expected mine life at Lucky Friday is approximately 17 years. Information with respect to the Lucky Friday unit’s production, Cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, average Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce, AISC, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce, and proven and probable ore reserves for the past three years is set forth in the table below.

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce, represent measurements that are not in accordance with GAAP that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations. We believe these measurements provide indicators of economic performance and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis, as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other operating mining properties. A reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, to these non-GAAP measures can be found in Item 7."

      "Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Company's Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Company's assets. At December 31, 1994, less than 1% of the Company's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans. The Company did not originate or acquire any junior mortgage loans in 1994. Loans Secured by Collateral Other than Real Estate. In June 1992, the Company received ten notes receivable secured by collateral other than real estate in satisfaction of a $622,000 obligation to the Company. At December 31, 1994, eight of the notes with a combined principal balance of $460,000 remained outstanding. The Company's investment policy precludes the origination of loans secured by collateral other than real estate. The following discussion briefly describes events that affected those loans during 1994. In February 1994, a note receivable with a principal balance of $48,000 and secured by the operations of a fast food restaurant in Wisconsin was modified. The modified note bears interest at 8.0% per annum in the first year, increasing by 0.5% per annum each year thereafter, requires monthly payments of interest only and annual principal payments of $5,000 and matures February 1, 1999. The borrower was unable to pay the principal installment due in December 1994. The Company is evaluating its options regarding this note, but does not anticipate incurring a loss in excess of the reserve previously established. In September 1994, the Company received $30,000 in settlement of a note receivable with a principal balance of $72,000. The Company recorded no loss on the settlement in excess of the reserve previously established. In October 1994, the Company received payment in full of a third note receivable with a principal balance of $74,000.\nITEM 3."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Both drill holes encountered blind near surface mineralization adjacent to structures that had been previously recognized and drilled. The 2006 drilling program was successful in expanding the known target areas and finding new areas of near-surface, low grade gold and silver. The new intercepts in the “C” resource area (H0604 and H0605), and the West Cliffs zone (H0606 through 0608) combined with the intercepts from the 2005 drilling program in the “A” area indicate potential for an increase in the historic target zones. Drilling in the north central area also provided new evidence for increasing targets (H0609 and 0610). The interpretation of the 2006 drilling results also suggests faults previously believed to dip to the east may roll to the west at relatively shallow depth. This finding coupled with the potential for increase of near-surface resources indicates changes are necessary to the exploration philosophy at Hercules. Previously, the historic drilling had concentrated on the east side of the structures, defining the shallow resources in “A” through “C”. The recent holes drilled in the 2005 and 2006 exploration programs suggest further near-surface targets are likely to be developed within the “A” through “C” areas, the West Cliffs hanging wall and the central core between these two areas. The topography is relatively flat allowing for an inexpensive, shallow drilling program. Drilling to depth on the structural zones remains a significant target for developing high grade resources at depth. Because of the interpretation of the deeper drill holes completed during this program, it is recommended that the next set of deep holes on the property should be drilled from west to east on the northeastern veins within the “B” to “C” resource areas. The interpretation of the recent drilling suggests that the veins may roll over developing dips of near vertical to westerly at depths of less than 500 feet. During 2007 the Company conducted a drill program that was completed in March 2008."

In addition, a total of 960 linear meters of mechanized trenching (38 trenches) was also conducted on Zone 2 in conjunction with this drill program to better define the surface trace of the host granitoid bodies, to test strike extension of known mineralization and to test gold-in-soil anomalies and geophysical targets. Five out of the above-noted seven holes targeting the Trench TKB006, TKB010 and TKB014E-TKB014F zones yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from one meter to 76 meters in core length. Mineralization identified to date by trenching and drilling, spread out over an approximately 975 meter east-west distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil trend, appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence."

    "documentation": [
      "Volcanic and sedimentary strata are capped by a thick sequence of non-deformed Late Tertiary ignimbrites, known as the Upper Volcanic Series (“UVS”). Property Geology\nThe oldest rocks exposed at San José de Gracia are deformed Paleozoic shale, sandstone, conglomerate and minor limestone, which are non-conformably overlain by andesite and rhyodacite flows and tuffs of the LVS. Volcanic and sedimentary strata are cut by quartz-feldspar porphyry, porphyritic diorite bodies and fine-grained mafic dykes, which may be co-temporal with the LVS. Ignimbrites of the UVS are exposed at higher elevations on the property and are thought to act as a post mineralization cap rock, thereby indicating an Early to Mid-Tertiary (Paleocene to Eocene) age for gold mineralization at San José de Gracia. Geologic Structure\nDetailed mapping within the project area has defined several stages of deformation, beginning with compression during the Laramide Orogeny which affected the Paleozoic basement and formed flat-lying reverse faults, which have been reactivated as conduits for gold-bearing fluids in the La Prieta trend. Extension in Tertiary time led to the development of second order structures, trending south, southwest and southeast; which formed the major structural orientations for mineralization at San José de Gracia. The latest phase of deformation is characterized by late-stage extension and southwest tilting. Property Mineralization\nHigh grade gold mineralization at San José de Gracia is found in vein structures hosted within andesite and rhyodacite of the Lower Volcanic Series (“LVS”) and underlying Paleozoic sediments as fault breccia veins and crackle breccias that exhibit multiple stages of reactivation and fluid flow, as evidenced by crustiform/colloform textures and cross cutting veins. Locally, veins exhibit sharp, clay gouge hanging wall and footwall contacts with slickensides, indicating reactivation of structurally-hosted veins subsequent to mineralization. Gold grades can also be carried within the mineralized halo adjacent to the principal veins as quartz-chlorite stockwork."

      "Six quality control samples (one blank and five standards) were inserted into each batch of 120 samples. The drill core was sawn, with half sent to the ALS Minerals sample preparation in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the samples were prepared for assay and then sent to the ALS Minerals Lab in Sparks, Nevada for analyses. Gold was analyzed by fire assay and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry finish and a four acid sample digestion with Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry method was used to analyze a full suite of elements. Samples were securely transported from the project site to the ALS Minerals preparation laboratory in Fairbanks via chartered aircraft hired by the Company. Donald G. Strachan, Certified Professional Geologist and Goldrich’s contracted project manager for Chandalar, managed the drill program and confirmed that all procedures, protocols and methodologies used in the drill program conform to industry standards. The results of this first diamond core exploration drilling on our Chandalar gold property have exposed what we believe is a wide-spread system of gold mineralization at intervals from surface to depths of up to 120 meters (about 400 feet). We also believe the mass of rock affected by the mineralizing system to be large, as more than 50 gold showings are scattered over about six square miles (fifteen square kilometers), only a fraction of which has yet been drill-tested. The drill cores contain a total of 56 mineralized intervals of 0.5 or greater grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) that average 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) in length and have a weighted average grade of 1.66 g/t Au (see table below). Gold-bearing intercepts were obtained in 72% of the holes, with many having multiple intercepts. Drilling results draw us to focus on two prospects - Aurora and Rock Glacier - which we believe are geologically associated and related to the same controlling mineralizing features. Intercepts include:\n·\n1.5 meters (5.0 feet) at 6.57 g/t Au in Hole LS11-0063 on the Aurora prospect;\n·\n2.1 meters (7.0 feet) at 6.02 g/t Au in Hole LS11-0041 on Rock Glacier\nA map and tables showing drill hole locations, drill depths, data and intercepts can be found in our annual reports filed with the SEC for 2011 and 2012."

      "Arimetco achieved recoveries of approximately 43 percent of the total copper grade from mostly uncrushed ore placed on the heaps. Arimetco ceased mining operations in mid-1997. The acid soluble copper assay techniques used by Arimetco for ore grade estimation are not directly comparable to the acid soluble copper assay techniques used by Cyprus. Arimetco recoveries were calculated based on total copper assays. The use of two different assay techniques by Cyprus and Arimetco could have led to inconsistencies in or the skewing of the data underlying our estimates, thereby increasing the risk of an overestimation of ore reserves at Johnson Camp Mine.

      "The gathering subsidiary gathers and transports the gas to a third-party processor, which processes the gas and pays XTO Energy and other producers for at least 50% of the liquids processed. After the gas is processed, the gathering subsidiary transports the gas via a residue pipeline to a connection with an interstate pipeline. The gathering subsidiary sells the residue gas to the marketing subsidiary of XTO Energy based upon a published index price. The gathering subsidiary pays this price to XTO Energy less a compression and gathering fee of approximately $0.31 per Mcf of residue gas. This gathering fee was previously approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when the gathering subsidiary was regulated. During 2008, the gathering system collected approximately 12,500 Mcf per day from 320 wells, approximately 50% of which XTO Energy operates. Estimated capacity of the gathering system is 28,000 Mcf per day. The gathering subsidiary also provides contract operating services to properties in Woodward County, collecting approximately 11,300 Mcf per day from 127 wells, for an average fee of approximately $0.05 per Mcf.\nXTO Energy also sells gas directly to its marketing subsidiary, which then sells the gas to third parties. The price paid to XTO Energy is based upon the weighted average price of several published indices, but does not include a deduction for any marketing fees. The price paid by the marketing affiliate includes a deduction for any transportation fees charged by the third party. Green River Basin The Green River Basin is located in southwestern Wyoming. Natural gas was discovered in the Fontenelle Field of the Green River Basin in the early 1970s. The producing reservoirs are the Frontier, Baxter and Dakota sandstones. Daily 2008 sales volumes from the underlying properties in the Fontenelle Field averaged 20,600 Mcf of natural gas and 43 Bbls of oil. In 2008, XTO Energy completed 7 gross (7.0 net) wells and performed 9 workovers. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not plan to drill any new wells and will perform up to 6 workovers in the Green River Basin during 2009."

    "question": "What is the expected outcome of the gold ore processing at the SCMP site, considering the 92% recovery rate and the market price of gold?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The SCMP site will generate a net loss of $100 per ton of gold ore processed, regardless of the market price.",
      "B) The SCMP site will break even on the gold ore processing, with a profit of $100 per ton only when the market price of gold exceeds $300 per ounce.",
      "C) The SCMP site will generate a profit of $92 per ton of gold ore processed, as the cost of processing is offset by the 92% recovery rate.",
      "D) The SCMP site will require an additional $50 per ton of gold ore processed to cover the costs of mining and processing, regardless of the market price."

      "Since SSGM's tailings' resource is exhausted, virgin gold ore is excavated from the SSGM surface and hauled to the SCMP site. The other sources of gold ore from the SSGM to be used at the SCMP operation will be obtained from the stope fill or higher grade gold ore after obtaining access through the underground workings from the main ore body. This gold ore will have to be crushed and pulverized which increases the cost, but then the yield is expected to be about a 92% recovery. The income, dependent on the market price of gold from the higher grade and recovery of gold ore, will be substantially more than the cost involved, providing that the world gold market price does not decline below $200 an ounce. The virgin ore and/or tailings are referred to herein as \"gold ore.\" The gold ore from the SSGM open-pit is loaded onto 20-25 ton dump trucks for transport to the SCMP. Trucks then haul the gold ore approximately 15 miles from the SSGM. Mine employees are responsible for the mining activities including the determination of areas to be excavated, trucking and loading operations, head sampling and sample analysis. The gold ore is received at the SCMP where it is weighed, logged, and sampled. Weighing is performed utilizing a conveyor belt scale and/or a truck scale located on the SCMP site. The excess gold ore is then unloaded at the SCMP site and stockpiled in an area which was developed to allow storage of more than 15,000 tons. SSGM gold ore is transferred from the stockpile to a feed bin utilizing a rubber-tired wheel loader. The feed bin has a capacity of approximately 10 cubic yards (13.5 tons). The feed is fed at a controlled rate onto a conveyor, which transfers the ore to the next part of the process. The conveyor includes a belt scale (weightometer) for instantaneous determination of feed rate and totalizing of tonnage fed to the process. The Joint Venture completed a certain stage of the retrofitting, rehabilitation, repairing and restoring of the SCMP's plant and it continues to perform such plant and equipment alterations, modifications and improvements to expand the SCMP's capacity to process 300/400 tons of virgin ore per day."

      "The property is over the northeastern flank of the San Antonio Mountains and in the Ralston Valley. Title\nMidway has controlled the property since 2001 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases subject to a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2% to 7% from commercial production based on changes in gold prices. In addition, the surface rights to 560 acres in Section 32 are held by the Town of Tonopah. The remaining 80 acres of surface rights in Section 32 are held as two 40-acre parcels by two owners, each of whom lives on their parcel. We hold the federal mineral rights of the entirety of Section 32 in unpatented claims. On August 15, 2008 the Company paid the annual minimum advance royalty, recoverable from commercial production of US$300,000. Drilling\nBetween May 1 and September 5, 2002, Midway completed 26,689.5 feet of drilling in 69 holes, mostly HQ core. Newmont entered into a joint venture on the Midway property in September 2002 and undertook extensive regional exploration programs including numerous regional and detailed geophysical surveys, including electromagnetic (“EM”), airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys, and ground radiometric, gravity and Controlled Source Audio Magneto Telluric (“CSAMT”) surveys. Newmont also mapped the Northwest and Thunder Mountain areas and completed rock and stream sediment geochemical surveys. From September 2002 to August 2003 the Newmont/Midway joint venture drilled a total of 67,703.5 feet in 121 holes in the greater Discovery area, the Thunder Mountain target area, and in the northwestern portion of the property. From August 2003 to February 2005, the Newmont/Midway joint venture drilled 23 angle holes for a total of 16,042 feet, including one hole that was abandoned at a depth of seven meters. Seven of the holes were drilled by reverse circulation methods, while the remainder was HQ core holes with reverse circulation pre-collars; a total of 10,195 feet of reverse circulation and 5,847 feet of core were drilled."
