    "question": "**\n\nThe San Sebastian Gold Mine (SSGM) is planning to commence an open-pit, heap-leaching operation. The Joint Venture has placed the SSGM into a curbed production operation and intends to obtain a sum of $8 million or more to commence this operation. The Joint Venture also plans to expand its production capacity over several years, with the following milestones:\n\n- Year 1: 2,000 tons per day\n- Year 2: 3,000 tons per day\n- Year 3: 4,000 tons per day\n- Year 5: 6,000 tons per day\n\nThe funding for these expansions will be sourced from a combination of earned profits, borrowings, equity sales, or other creative sources. The SSGM has a total of 138 million tons of gold ore with a grade of 0.025 ounces of gold per ton. The Joint Venture's geologists have determined that the SSGM has minable gold ore reserves via an open pit of approximately 13.4 million tons of gold ore which should contain approximately 1.166 million ounces of gold. The SSGM is also actively engaged in the exploration and development of the peripheral area surrounding the main body of gold ore to increase its gold ore reserves.\n\nGiven the above information, what is the estimated total gold production from the SSGM open-pit, heap-leaching operation during the first twelve full operating months?",

The project is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and has a holding cost of $22,630 due to BLM for claim maintenance fees prior to September 1 each year. The project is located approximately 152 miles from the White Mesa Mill at Blanding, Utah, and about 139 miles from the Pinon Ridge mill proposed by EFRC near Naturita, Colorado. The property is located on the eastern side of the San Rafael Swell in east-central Utah, approximately 140 air miles southeast of Salt Lake City. The little desert community of Green River, Utah is located about ten miles to the east. The property is accessible year-round except for periods of heavy snowstorms during December through February and increased monsoon rains and summer cloudburst storms during August through October. Access for drilling and other exploration activity is excellent, except during occasional heavy rainy periods which can create heavy flash flooding and roads mudding-up and becoming impassable.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true about the San Rafael Uranium Project?",

    "question": "**\n\nThe Newsboy Gold Project is located in the Vulture Mountains of Arizona, with a significant portion of its land being state and federal lands. The project is accessed via paved and gravel roads for 3 miles due west of Morristown, crossing the Hassayampa River, which flows a few days per year after severe rain storms. The project is close to several well-known historical gold mines, including the Vulture, Congress, and Yarnell mines. The project's mineralization is associated with extensional faults outside of the caldera complex, facilitated by the Bullfrog Hills Fault System (BHFS). The primary structure of the BHFS is the Southern Bullfrog Hills Fault (SBHF), which separates Proterozoic metamorphic rocks in the footwall from weakly metamorphosed Paleozoic sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic rocks in the hanging wall. The SBHF is an east-west-trending, north-dipping, district-scale, low-angle detachment fault. The SBHF-FCF appears to decrease in displacement from west to east across the greater Bullfrog district, with the northward dip increasing from west to east. The region is underlain by Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, which are the basement for the mid-Miocene tuffs and related rocks that host most of the mineralization in the Bullfrog mining district. The region has been subjected to extensional faulting contemporaneous with volcanism, resulting in the development of localized sedimentary basins filled with reworked volcanic and basement debris.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true about the Newsboy Gold Project?",
