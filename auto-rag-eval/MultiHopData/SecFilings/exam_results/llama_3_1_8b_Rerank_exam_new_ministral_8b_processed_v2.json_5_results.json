The project is close to several well-known historical gold mines, including the Vulture, Congress, and Yarnell mines. The project's mineralization is associated with extensional faults outside of the caldera complex, facilitated by the Bullfrog Hills Fault System (BHFS). The primary structure of the BHFS is the Southern Bullfrog Hills Fault (SBHF), which separates Proterozoic metamorphic rocks in the footwall from weakly metamorphosed Paleozoic sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic rocks in the hanging wall. The SBHF is an east-west-trending, north-dipping, district-scale, low-angle detachment fault. The SBHF-FCF appears to decrease in displacement from west to east across the greater Bullfrog district, with the northward dip increasing from west to east. The region is underlain by Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, which are the basement for the mid-Miocene tuffs and related rocks that host most of the mineralization in the Bullfrog mining district. The region has been subjected to extensional faulting contemporaneous with volcanism, resulting in the development of localized sedimentary basins filled with reworked volcanic and basement debris.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true about the Newsboy Gold Project?",

The mineralization is largely localized along two parallel dip-slip multi-vein structures which trend north-northeast.

The West Cliff Zone also contains additional mineralization as indicated in widely spaced drilling and surface sampling results.

In 1929, a report indicated the presence of a \"Golden Lion Mine\" with 300,000 tons of \"vein material\" averaging 0.20 oz/ton gold and 8 oz/ton silver. The property was abandoned due to minimal mining activity. In 1980, a joint venture between Keradamex Inc. and E & B Exploration conducted soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, limited underground sampling, and drilled seven core holes into the Main mine workings area. This drilling revealed fracture-related gold mineralization up to 36 meters thick. In 1982, Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983, a joint venture with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. was formed, and Derry, Michener, and Booth conducted further assessments. In 1984, Naneco Resources Ltd. acquired the property and initiated drilling, which revealed encouraging results with anomalous grades of gold and silver.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true regarding the Longstreet Property?",

    "question": "**\n\nNatural gas and oil operations are subject to various conservation laws and regulations that regulate the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled and unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum allowable production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of natural gas and oil that can be produced, potentially raise prices, and to limit the number of wells or the locations which can be drilled. Federal Natural Gas Regulation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \u201cFERC\u201d) is primarily responsible for federal regulation of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal governmental regulation, including regulation of transportation and storage tariffs and various other matters, by FERC. On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. Wellhead sales of domestic natural gas are not subject to regulation. Consequently, sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation, and sales. In addition, the FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true regarding the regulation of natural gas sales?",
