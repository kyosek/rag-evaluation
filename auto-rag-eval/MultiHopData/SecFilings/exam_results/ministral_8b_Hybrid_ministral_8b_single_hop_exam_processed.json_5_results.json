The cost of service for a utility includes operating expenses, depreciation, and taxes.\n2. State utility commissions periodically review and adjust rates based on a utility's revenues and expenses during a defined test period and its level of investment.\n3. In some states, reviews can be initiated by the commission on its own initiative, while in others, reviews may be requested by utilities, customers, or representatives of customer groups.\n4. AEP's public utility subsidiaries generally base their rates on the cost of providing bundled electric service.\n5. In Ohio, Virginia, and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service, with market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation.\n6. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved rate stabilization plans that address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008.\n7. In Virginia, APCO's base rates are capped at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if a competitive market for generation exists.\n8.
