The results of the trench and pit sampling are summarized in Table 14.\n\nA recent acquisition to the North Mara group of licences is the Maji Moto licence, which was awarded to the Company by the Ministry of Mines through application and tender in April 2012. The licence is situated in the North Mara Greenstone Belt (Eastern Musoma Goldfields) approximately 28 kilometers to the SW of African Barrick\u2019s North Mara Gold Mine.\n\nThe Company is considering developing a north-trending adit from the southern side at the base of the hill at a later date. Metallurgical test work is to be undertaken on the oxide rock material taken from artisanal workings and trenches on surface as part of the scoping study to determine the viability of commencing and open pit/underground small-scale mining operation at BIF Hill.\n\nWhich of the following statements is CORRECT?",

    "question": "The company's DD&A expense per MCFE increased by 27% to $2.12 in 2007 compared to $1.67 in 2006. This increase is attributed to upward cost pressure in the industry, specifically due to drilling activities in 2007 and 2006 that added costs at a higher per unit rate relative to the prior year's base. However, the DD&A per MCFE rate was further affected by upward adjustments to reserves due to pricing differences between December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006. This adjustment had the impact of lowering DD&A. Exploration expense increased $6.8 million or 13% to $58.7 million in 2007 compared to $51.9 million for 2006. This increase is due to a $7.5 million increase in geologic and geophysical expense to support a larger overall program as well as a $4.2 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense related to three wells located in the Gulf Coast region and one in the Rockies region. These increases were offset by a $4.9 million decrease in exploration overhead expense related to a reduction in amounts recorded in exploration expense related to payments under the Net Profits Plan. In 2007, the company had a change in its accounting estimate to reflect the view that Net Profits Plan distributions should be reclassified to exploration overhead only for individuals who are currently employed by the company and who continue to be involved in its exploration efforts. Therefore, Net Profits Plan payments associated with the distributions under the Net Profits Plan for ex-employees were reclassified to general and administrative expense since there is no longer any functional link to exploration expense as there is by definition no periodic cost associated with geologic, geophysical, and exploration-related work by those ex-employees. General and administrative expenses increased $21.3 million or 55% to $60.1 million for 2007, compared with $38.9 million for 2006. G&A increased $0.14 to $0.56 per MCFE for 2007 compared to $0.42 per MCFE for the period in 2006 as G&A grew at a faster rate than the 16% increase in production.",

    "question": "A mining company has estimated that its current inventory of heap leach pad inventory will yield 100,000 ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold, with a total value of $10 million. However, the company's estimates of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within the heap leach pad inventory are inherently inaccurate and subjective, and may vary from the estimates. The company's production plans are based on a long-term silver price average of $5.25 per ounce and a long-term gold price average of $375 per ounce. If the realized price for the metals the company produces were to decline substantially below the levels set for calculation of reserves for an extended period, there could be material delays in the exploration of new projects, increased net losses, reduced cash flow, restatements or reductions in reserves and asset write-downs in the applicable accounting periods. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true, given the information provided?",

    "question": "The Lik deposit is a black shale-hosted stratiform zinc-lead-silver sedimentary-exhalitive (SEDEX) deposit. The mineralization is syngenetic with respect to sediment deposition. Silicification occurs within and peripheral to the main mass of sulfides. Major sulfides in decreasing order of abundance are pyrite-marcasite, sphalerite and galena. The ore textures are massive, fragmental, chaotic, and veined; they rarely show typical sedimentary layering. The portion of the ore body near the surface is oxidized. The deposit is continuous outside the Lik property onto the adjacent 100%-owned Teck property to the south. The southern continuation of the Lik deposit is referred to as the Su deposit, lying on Teck\u2019s Su property. Within the Lik property, the deposit is divided into two parts by the Main Break Fault. The main part of the deposit within the existing claims is referred to as the Lik South deposit. As presently tested, the Lik South deposit has a surface footprint of about 3,600 feet long and about 2,000 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 650 feet. The Lik South deposit remains open down dip. North of the Main Break Fault, the Lik North deposit has a surface footprint of about 2,300 feet long and about 1,150 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 1,000 feet. The Lik North deposit remains strongly open down dip and to the north. The deposits strike northerly and dip westerly at about 25o to 40o. The mineralization comprises irregular, stratiform lenses. The mineralogy of the sulfides is simple and comprises pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, and galena. Gangue minerals include quartz (as chert), clay minerals, carbonate and barite. Noranda recognized six different ore types in its logging of drill core. Previous work by GCO determined that sulfides were deposited in four distinct cycles.",
