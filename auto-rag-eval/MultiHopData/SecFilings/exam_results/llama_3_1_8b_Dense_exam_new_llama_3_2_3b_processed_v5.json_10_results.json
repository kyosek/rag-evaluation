    "question": "The Jungo property appears to contain at least two mineral systems, an earlier, higher temperature copper-dominated system and a later lower temperature gold and silver dominated system. However, the 2010 drill hole intersected a strong, thick zone with strong sulfides, which may be associated with the copper-dominated system. This zone also contains measurable levels of gold, suggesting a possible nugget effect. Considering the information from Kernow Resources, the 1990s drilling program, and the 2010 trenching program, what is the most likely explanation for the presence of gold in the copper-dominated system?",

    "question": "The Fund acquired a 100% interest in a joint venture that owns a 254,000 square-foot, single-tenant industrial building in suburban Atlanta, Georgia, built in 1994 and expanded in 1996. The tenant\u2019s lease expires in 2009. The joint venture placed a $5.4 million, 5.31% fixed-rate mortgage loan on this property, maturing in 2015, interest-only for five years. Additionally, the joint venture had a $0.8 million variable-rate loan at LIBOR plus 140 basis points (5.69% at December 31, 2005), maturing in 2010 with an option to extend the term two additional years at a market rate. The purchase price for the office building was $8.5 million. We invested $6,800,000 for our interest in the joint venture. At the time of the acquisition, the joint venture placed a $20,438,000 five-year mortgage loan on this property, bearing a variable interest rate of one month LIBOR plus 235 basis points. In February 2004, the promissory note related to this loan was sold to an unaffiliated third party lender and amended to reflect a variable interest rate of one month LIBOR plus 145 basis points, a maturity date of April 2007 and a payment guarantee from us of $5,500,000. Considering the above information, what is the expected interest rate on the $20,438,000 five-year mortgage loan at the end of the fifth year, assuming the variable interest rate is reset to a market rate?",
