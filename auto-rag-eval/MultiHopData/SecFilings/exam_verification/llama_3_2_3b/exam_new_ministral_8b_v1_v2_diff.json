      "We employ drilling, production and reservoir engineers, geologists and other specialists who have worked and will work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. We also employ field operating personnel including production superintendents, production foremen, production technicians and lease operators. We charge the non-operating partners an operating fee for operating the wells, typically on a fee per well-operated basis proportionate to each owner's working interest. Our non-operated wells are managed by third-party operators who are typically independent oil and natural gas companies. Oil and Natural Gas Leases\nThe typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. In our areas of operation, this amount generally ranges from 12.5% to 33.7%, resulting in an 87.5% to 66.3% net revenue interest to the working interest owners, including us. Most of our leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments. Derivative Activity\nWe enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties with respect to oil and natural gas prices to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We have entered into derivative contracts in the form of fixed price swaps for NYMEX WTI oil, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas as well as Midland-to-Cushing crude oil and CIG-Rockies basis differentials. We also enter into derivative transactions with respect to London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") interest rates to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates. All of our interest rate derivative transactions are LIBOR interest rate swaps. Our derivatives swap floating LIBOR rates for fixed rates. All of these commodity and interest rate contracts were executed in a costless manner, requiring no payment of premiums."

      "In addition, because snowboarding is a winter sport, sales of the Company's snowboard boots have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters. As the Company increases its international sales through VFEL and experiences changes in its product mix, it expects that its quarterly results will vary from historical trends. Therefore, the results of operations of any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, the Company's operating results fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis as a result of holidays, weather and the timing of large shipments. The Company's gross margins also fluctuate according to product mix, cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company's future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts. Historically, the Company has shipped a large portion of its products late in the quarter. Consequently, the Company may not learn of sales shortfalls until late in any particular fiscal quarter, which could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. TRADE CREDIT RISK The Company's results of operations are affected by the timely payment for products by its customers. Although the Company's bad debt expense has not been material to date, no assurance can be given that it will not increase relative to net sales in the future or that the Company's current reserves for bad debt will be adequate. Any significant increase in the Company's bad debt expense relative to net sales could adversely impact the Company's net income and cash flow, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY\nCertain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on the products offered by the Company, including, among other things, general business conditions, interest rates, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.",
      "The Company also anticipates that several large, well-known companies, such as Nike, Inc. and Fila SpA will enter the snowboard boot industry in the future. These companies are much larger and have greater financial resources than the Company, and have significant brand recognition. Snowboarding is a relatively new sport and there can be no assurance that it will continue to grow at the rate experienced in recent years, or that its popularity will not decline. Moreover, the market for snowboarding is characterized by image-conscious consumers. The failure by the Company to accurately predict and target future trends or to maintain its progressive image could have a material adverse effect on its snowboard boots sales. The Company believes that its future success in the snowboard boot market will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to introduce innovative, well-received products, and there can be no assurance that it will do so.\nApparel Industry. The Company is a new entrant in the apparel business. The apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and many of the Company's competitors have significantly greater financial resources than the Company and spend substantially more on product advertising than the Company. Additionally, the apparel industry is particularly dependent on changes in fashion, which will require the Company to devote substantial resources to responding to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner. See \"--Changes in Fashion Trends. \"\nDEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS\nApproximately 85% of the Company's shoes and 100% of the Company's snowboard boots sold during fiscal 1997 were manufactured by independent suppliers located in South Korea. The Company has increased its reliance on offshore manufacturers by commencing sourcing of footwear and apparel in the Peoples Republic of China, India and Israel and anticipates that it will begin sourcing some footwear in Mexico in the near future and some apparel from other Far East countries, such as Thailand and Taiwan.",
      "The price of steel scrap has increased dramatically over the last year and we expect it to continue to increase in the future. If steel prices continue to increase or increase more than we anticipate, our gross profit could be negatively impacted. Additionally, the increased cost of steel could cause owners and contractors of projects to seek out less-expensive alternatives to steel buildings, such as concrete. If the use of steel in the construction of buildings declines significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations for any period. Fluctuating Quarterly Results of Operations\nWe have experienced, and in the future are expected to continue to experience, substantial variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In particular, our operating results may vary because of downturns in one or more segments of the building construction industry, changes in economic conditions, our failure to obtain, or delays in awards of, major projects, the cancellation of major projects, or our failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion. In addition, from time to time we have disputes with our customers concerning change orders to our contracts. To the extent such disputes are not resolved on a timely basis, our results of operations may be affected. Any of the foregoing factors could result in the periodic inefficient or\nunderutilization of our resources and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Revenue Recognition Estimates\nWe recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on either the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours."

      "There can be no assurance that we will be successful or prevail in our defense, or that a failure to prevail will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Employment Development Department of the State of California, Notice of Assessment No. 00008 This matter was initially reported in our Quarterly Report for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007, filed on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2007, and was last updated in our Quarterly Report for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, filed on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2009. As previously reported, this matter relates to a Notice of Assessment No. 00008 (dated July 10, 2007) sent to our wholly-owned subsidiary, iPayment of California, LLC (âiPOCâ) by the Employment Development Department of the State of California (âEDDâ) for amounts claimed to be due arising during the period starting April 1, 2004 and ending March 31, 2007. The Notice of Assessment stated that we had been assessed approximately $1.4 million, plus an additional $0.1 million for accrued interest billed to the date assessed (the âAssessmentâ) due to a determination by the EDD, following an audit, that during the covered period we improperly classified and treated certain individuals as independent contractors rather than as employees, and therefore, failed to properly report amounts paid as âwages,â failed to withhold (and deposit) amounts for certain employee contributions on said wages, including withholdings for California personal income tax, and failed to remit amounts for employer contributions otherwise due on these âunreported wages.â As we have previously reported, we have been working with the EDD auditor that issued the Assessment to resolve the Assessment. In August 2009, the EDD auditor that issued the Assessment conducted a voluntary tax audit review conference with our representative and based on the records and information examined during the conference, the Auditor requested that we submit certain additional records and information relating to 2007 that would further support our position for the abatement of the Assessment.",
      "Since we last reported on this matter, we submitted the additional requested records and information to the EDD auditor and have continued to communicate with the EDD auditor as well as with the EDD employee assigned to our account by the EDD Sacramento collections division. Based upon our February 2010 communications and correspondence with the EDD Auditor, we currently expect to have another voluntary tax audit review conference with the EDD Auditor during the month of April 2010. Although we are still currently subject to the Assessment, based upon our most recent communication and correspondence with the EDD, we currently believe that the EDD has, for the present time, deferred taking any further âcollectionâ action, in order to provide us and the EDD auditor additional time to resolve the Assessment. Although the results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe, based on information currently available, that the ultimate outcome of this matter and our liability associated therewith should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, the results cannot be predicted with certainty and in the event of unexpected future developments or additional information, it is possible that this matter could be unfavorable to us, and there can be no assurance that a failure to prevail will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOther- Merrick Bank\nThis matter was initially reported in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2006, filed on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2007, and was last updated in our Quarterly Report for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, filed on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2009. As previously reported, Merrick Bank, one of our sponsor banks, incurred certain Visa/MasterCard fines related to a third party processor in 2005. Merrick withheld certain funds from us related to the Visa/MasterCard fines, and we have been in a dispute with Merrick since 2005 regarding our liability to them for such fines.",
      "The Company has no independent directors and no audit committee. There is no policy on fraud. A whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization. (2)\nDue to the significant number and magnitude of out-of-period adjustments identified during the audit of our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2009, management has concluded that the controls over the period-end financial reporting process were not operating effectively. Controls were not effective to ensure that significant year end accrued liabilities were appropriately reviewed, analyzed, and monitored on a timely basis. A material weakness in the period-end financial reporting process could result in the Company not being able to meet its regulatory filing deadlines and, if not remediated, has the potential to cause a material misstatement or to miss a filing deadline in the future. Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companyâs registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managementâs report was not subject to attestation by the Companyâs registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managementâs report in this annual report.

In January 1992, the partnership stopped making payments on the first mortgage secured by the One East Penn Square Office Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An affiliate of the lender owned the remaining 45% limited partner interest. In May 1993, the lender filed a foreclosure action against One Penn Square. On October 6, 1993, the court appointed a receiver for the property. The lender also filed an action against the partnership and the Company to set aside, as a fraudulent conveyance, payments from the partnership to the Company in 1992 and in 1993 of $1.8 million made to repay the Company's mortgage note secured by a second lien on the One East Penn Square Office Building. In April 1994, the Company and the lender reached an agreement which provided that the Company pay $575,000 to the lender and convey the Company's interest in the partnership to the lender. In August 1994, the Company made the required $575,000 payment, conveyed its partnership interest to the lender and the parties executed mutual releases and all litigation between the parties was dismissed. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million as the carrying value of its investment in the partnership was less than the debt secured by the One Penn Square Office Building due to previously recognized equity losses. In March 1994, the Company sold its 50% general partner interests in Pilgrim Village Associates and Pilgrim Village Associates II to the co-general partner for $2.6 million in cash. The partnerships owned the Pilgrim Village Apartments I and II, respectively, in Canton Township, Michigan. The Company recognized a gain of $2.5 million on the sale. Effective January 1, 1995, the other 50% general partners in both Twinbrook Village Associates, which owns Twinbrook Village Apartments in Rockville, Maryland, and Gate Laurel Associates, which owns the Westgate of Laurel Apartments in Laurel, Maryland, conveyed their interests in the partnerships to the Company in exchange for a release from their general partner liability.",

In the event that the 25% general partner does not elect to purchase the Partnership's interest, the Partnership will acquire the 25% partner's interest. The 25% general partner must exercise his option no later than March 25, 1998. In April 1997, the Partnership sold Tollhill East, a 81,115 square foot office building in Dallas, Texas, for $7.0 million in cash. The Partnership received net cash of $4.2 million after the payoff of $2.4 million in existing mortgage debt and the payment of various closing costs associated with the sale. The Partnership paid Carmel Realty a real estate brokerage commission of $209,000 based on the $7.0 million sales price of the property. The Partnership recognized a gain of $3.6 million on the sale. Also in April 1997, the Partnership modified and extended the mortgage secured by the Cross County Mall in Mattoon, Illinois. In conjunction with the modification, the Partnership made a principal reduction payment of $137,500. The modified and extended mortgage bears interest at a variable rate, currently 9.6% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $71,262 and has an extended maturity of April 2002. In June 1997, the Partnership refinanced the mortgage debt secured by the Pheasant Ridge Apartments in Bellevue, Nebraska in the amount of $5.7 million. The Partnership received net cash of $804,000 after the payoff of $4.6 million in existing mortgage debt, the funding of escrows, and the payment of various closing costs associated with the refinancing. The new mortgage bears interest at 7.89% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $41,742 and matures in July 2007. The Partnership paid BCM a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $57,000 based on the new $5.7 million mortgage.

      "Item 2. Properties for a description of the foreclosure. On September 9, 1993, St. James Limited Partnership (\"SJLP\"), a limited partnership in which the Registrant owns a 98% interest, filed a reorganization petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. After filing the petition, it became apparent that there could not be a confirmable plan of reorganization without either the Registrant making an additional equity contribution to SJLP or an extremely favorable settlement of a complaint by the Registrant against the Registrant's co-general partner in SJLP and United National Bank alleging misappropriation of funds from a deficit cash reserve account. See Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Since the Registrant had no additional sources of equity and the outcome of the co-general partner/bank suit was uncertain, the automatic stay was lifted and the first mortgage holder foreclosed on the property on October 21, 1994. On August 14, 1992, Commercial Federal Realty Investors Corporation (\"CFRIC\"), the owner of a 1% interest in the Saunders Apartments Joint Venture (\"SAJV\") filed an action in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska seeking damages of $275,000 plus interest alleged to be due under the terms of various agreements between parties which were executed in connection with the establishment of the joint venture. The Registrant denied liability and filed a counterclaim seeking declaratory judgment and money damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. On June 1, 1993, a settlement agreement was reached and an Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement was reached whereby the Registrant was entitled to retain all funds held in escrow ($275,000) pursuant to the original joint venture agreement. In return, CFRIC agreed to convert $1,155,000 in amounts owed to it by SAJV to a capital contribution, (increasing its ownership in SAJV to 70%) and will receive 100% of future income, losses and tax credits for tax purposes until such time as it recovers $430,000 of the capital contribution, any advances it must make on behalf of the property in the form of loan reduction and cash flow shortfalls (with interest at 10%), and any amounts resulting from any recapture of tax credits."

The purpose of this Plan is to provide incentives to attract, retain and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the success of the Company by offering them an opportunity to participate in the Company's future performance through awards of Options, Restricted Stock and Stock Bonuses. PLAN INFORMATION\nStock options exercisable into an aggregate of 1,419,568 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding on March 28, 2013, of which 1,419,568 were vested as of March 28, 2013. Stock options exercisable into an aggregate of 440,668 shares of the Company's common stock were granted and vested during fiscal year 2012 for services performed during the 2012 fiscal year. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the option fair values, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure.\" This option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term (the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire).",
      "In order to achieve these objectives, our compensation committee will be tasked with developing and maintaining a transparent compensation plan that will tie a substantial portion of our executives' overall compensation to our sales, operational efficiencies and profitability. Our board of directors has not set any performance objectives or benchmarks for 2010, as it intends for those objectives and benchmarks to be determined by the compensation committee once it is constituted and then approved by the board. However, we anticipate that compensation benefits will include competitive salaries, bonuses (cash and equity based), health insurance and stock option plans. Our compensation committee will meet at least quarterly to assess the cost and effectiveness of each executive benefit and the performance of our executive officers in light of our revenues, expenses and profits. OTHER CONTRACTS\nNone. OPTION/SAR GRANTS TABLE\nThere were no stock options/SARS granted under the Company's stock option plans to executive officers and directors during fiscal 2009 or 2008. AGGREGATE OPTION/SAR EXERCISES AND FISCAL YEAR-END OPTION/SAR VALUE TABLE There were no exercises of stock options/SAR by executive officers during fiscal 2009 or 2008.\nLONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS\nThere were no long-term incentive plan awards made in the last two fiscal years. REPRICING OPTIONS During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not reprice any stock options. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS. To our knowledge, the following table sets forth, as of March 3, 2010, information regarding the ownership of our common stock by:\n* Persons who own more than 5% of our common stock * each of our directors and each of our executive officers; and * all directors and executive officers as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted.",
      "The officer and employee stock incentive plans allow for the granting of stock options, stock bonuses, stock appreciation rights, cash bonus rights and sale of restricted stock. Awards under the officer and employee stock incentive plans are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The time limit within which options may be exercised and other exercise terms are fixed by the Committee. The directors' plan grants options for 1,000 shares annually to each outside director. Option prices of the plans to date have been at the fair market value on the date of grant. When stock options are exercised, the proceeds (including any tax benefits to the Company arising as a result of the exercise) are credited to the appropriate\ncommon stock and paid-in capital accounts. At April 2, 1995, 1,444,000 stock incentive plan shares were available for future grants and 1,036,000 stock incentive shares were immediately exercisable. The outstanding options for stock incentive plan shares have expiration dates ranging from 1995 to 2004. Changes during 1995, 1994 and 1993 in stock incentive plan shares outstanding and exercisable were as follows:\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN In 1988, PCC adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised to purchase 1/100 of a share of series A no par serial preferred stock at a purchase price of $135, subject to adjustment. The rights will be exercisable only (i) if a person or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) following the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, or (iii) after the Board of Directors of PCC declares any person who owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding common stock to be an Adverse Person. Each right will entitle its holder to receive, upon exercise, common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other security of PCC) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. If, after a person acquires 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, PCC is acquired in a merger or other business combination in which PCC does not survive or in which its common stock is exchanged, each right will be adjusted to entitle its holder to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right."

      "Accordingly, by Agreement For Purchase And Sale Of Partnership Interest entered into on February 28, 2002, the Partnership sold thirty-three percent (33%) of its Partnership Interests in Flambeau Village for Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) and granted purchaser, Flambeau Village Properties, LL.C., a Wisconsin limited liability company, an option for Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) to purchase the balance of the Partnership's Partnership Interests consisting of sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Partnership's limited partnership interests in Flambeau Village for an additional Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) subject to the exercise of the option and a final closing only after the expiration of Flambeau Village's 15-Year Tax Credit Compliance Period on January 1, 2004. Flambeau Village as of December 31, 2000 had an estimated remaining depreciable basis of $1,696,030, thirty-three percent (33%) of which the Partnership would have received in the way of passive losses proportionately over approximately 16.5 years from December 31, 2000 had thirty-three percent (33%) of its interest in Flambeau Village not been sold. Further the Partnership will not receive its interest in the balance of Flambeau Village's depreciable basis remaining after January 1, 2004 if the purchaser exercises the Option to purchase the remaining sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Partnership's interest in Flambeau Village. SULLIVAN GARDEN APARTMENTS, L.P. AND MILLS-SHAPLEY PARTNERSHIP, L.P.\nThe Partnership also chose to sell its interests in two other Operating Partnerships which owned small, troubled Projects. The general partners of Operating Partnerships Sullivan Garden Apartments, L.P. (\"Sullivan Garden\") and Mills-Shapley Partnership, L.P. (\"Mills-Shapley\"), each sought to sell their Projects to third-parties prior to the expiration of each project's 15-Year Tax Credit Compliance Period as both Projects had substantial deferred maintenance and suffered from extremely high vacancies. While the Partnership could not approve the sale of either Project because of the potential recapture of Tax Credits, understanding the troubled nature of both Projects, the Partnership agreed to approve the transfer of the general partners' interests and to sell the purchasers a portion of the Partnership's limited partnership interests in each Operating Partnership at the present time and to grant the purchasers an option to purchase the balance of the Partnership's limited partnership interest after the expiration of the Project's 15-Year Tax Credit Compliance Period in an attempt to facilitate the purchasers' takeover and revitalization of each Project.",

Accordingly, the Project's appraised value appears to be only $96,545 above the Project's first mortgage loan.

Accordingly, the Partnership did not commence an action to attempt to recover the damages the Partnership has suffered as a result of the breaches of the Operating Partnership Agreement by the Developer/General Partner of Flambeau Village, as the Partnership could not determine the availability of other assets of the Developer/General Partner of Flambeau Village from which a damage award could be satisfied. As the repayment of the fees of $117,815 for professional services paid by the Partnership on behalf of Flambeau Village was subject to its having sufficient cash flow from operations to cover ongoing operating expenses and fund the necessary reserves, which this Operating Partnership did not have, and the Partnership was facing potential litigation against with the Developer/General Partner of Flambeau Village and there could be no assurance that any such amounts would be recovered by the Partnership, the Partnership chose to settle with the Developer/General Partner of Flambeau Village by accepting the payment of $100,000 in satisfaction of the fees of $117,815 for professional services paid by the Partnership on behalf of Flambeau Village and by agreeing to terminate the Partnership's interest in Flambeau Village.

OIL AND GAS MARKETING\nOur oil and gas production is sold primarily under market-sensitive or spot price contracts.",
      "The Company's future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. GAS GATHERING SYSTEMS\nThe Company's gas gathering systems are owned by Continental Gas Inc. (\"CGI\"). Natural gas and casinghead gas are purchased at the wellhead primarily under either market-sensitive percent-of-proceeds-index contracts or keep-whole gas purchase contracts or fee-based contracts. Under percent-of-proceeds-index contracts, CGI receives a fixed percentage of the monthly index posted price for natural gas and a fixed percentage of the resale price for natural gas liquids. CGI generally receives between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and from 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from natural gas liquids sales. Under keep-whole gas purchase contracts, CGI retains all natural gas liquids recovered by its processing facilities and keeps the producers whole by returning to the producers at the tailgate of its plants an amount of residue gas, equal on a BTU basis, to the natural gas received at the plant inlet. The keep-whole component of the contract permits the Company to benefit when the value of natural gas liquids is greater as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream. Under the fee-based contracts, CGI receives a fixed rate per MMBTU of gas sold. This rate per MMBTU remains fixed regardless of commodity prices. OIL AND GAS MARKETING\nThe Company's oil and gas production is sold primarily under market-sensitive or spot price contracts. The Company sells substantially all of its casinghead gas to purchasers under varying percentage-of-proceeds contracts. By the terms of these contracts, the Company receives a fixed percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The Company normally receives between 80% and 100% of the proceeds from natural gas sales and from 80% to 100% of the proceeds from natural gas liquids sales received by the Company's purchasers when the products are resold.",
      "The Seminole Energy gathering agreements provide Magnum Hunter Production with long-term operating rights and firm capacity rights for daily delivery of up to 30,000 mcf of controlled gas through Seminole Energyâs Appalachian gathering system, which interconnects with Spectra Energy Partnersâ East Tennessee Interstate pipeline network at Rogersville, Tennessee. This ensures continued deliverability from our connected fields, representing over 90% of our Magnum Hunter Production natural gas production, to major East Coast natural gas markets. The Seminole Energy gathering agreements were restructured in connection with our acquisition of NGAS in April 2011. The restructured agreements substantially reduced the gas gathering fees payable by Magnum Hunter Production for all throughput volumes from future wells in the reserve areas dedicated to Seminole Energy under these agreements. Gas Processing. Eureka Pipeline owns a 50% interest in a liquids extraction plant in Rogersville, Tennessee, used for the processing of natural gas delivered through Seminole Energyâs Appalachian gathering system. The Rogersville processing plant extracts natural gas liquids at levels enabling us to flow dry pipeline quality natural gas into the interstate network. The Rogersville processing plant is currently configured for throughput at rates up to 25,000 mcf per day, which can be increased to accommodate production growth and relief of constrained regional supplies. Magnum Hunter Production owns a 50% interest in a nitrogen rejection facility in western Kentucky, used for the processing of Magnum Hunter Productionâs Illinois Basin production. The nitrogen rejection facility is part of the infrastructure for Magnum Hunter Productionâs New Albany Shale project in western Kentucky.

Property Mineralization\nHigh grade gold mineralization at San JosÃ© de GracÃ­a is found in vein structures hosted within andesite and rhyodacite of the Lower Volcanic Series (âLVSâ) and underlying Paleozoic sediments as fault breccia veins and crackle breccias that exhibit multiple stages of reactivation and fluid flow, as evidenced by crustiform/colloform textures and cross cutting veins. Locally, veins exhibit sharp, clay gouge hanging wall and footwall contacts with slickensides, indicating reactivation of structurally-hosted veins subsequent to mineralization. Gold grades can also be carried within the mineralized halo adjacent to the principal veins as quartz-chlorite stockwork.",
      "Mineralization is primarily gold with lesser silver values. A strong northeast structural fabric may represent a deep seated structure controlling the localization of the dome complex as a whole. Localization of some of the mineralization there may be controlled by northwest trending structures with left lateral movement, sub-parallel to the Guazapares and Batosegachic faults. Pre-1956 mining exploited near-surface, oxidized portions of the mineralized structures, producing silver and minor gold. On a district scale, the lithology, structural setting and controls of mineralization appear strongly analogous to other deposits in the general area, particularly to those at the Palmarejo deposit, approximately 15 kilometers to the west, and to Dolores, 200 kilometers on trend to the north-northwest. SAN MIGUEL PROJECT - PRINCIPAL CONCESSIONS AND DRILLING AREAS\nSanta Clara - La Union - Area Geology There are three principal geologic units mapped in the 2.5 kilometer long area stretching from the little-explored Santa Clara area in the south to San Luis in the centre of the Guazapares district. A north-south striking, west dipping andesitic basement composed of andesitic flows and volcaniclastic rocks with a few dacitic to rhyolitic tuff horizons underlies the western portions of the area. Total thickness is unknown. To the east, a package of lithic to quartzo-feldspathic tuffs discordantly overlies the andesites and displays a north-northeast trending pseudo-stratification with dips of 15 to 40 degrees to the northwest. The fault zone separating the western andesites and the eastern tuffs is characterized by a sharp eastern margin. West of this fault plane the fault zone is complex with fault splits, and mineralized fractures particularly in the San Jose area. A dacitic dike outcrops intermittently along the contact between these two units, striking approximately N30W and dipping 50 to 70 degrees north-east. Enveloping the fault zone is a widespread zone of propylitic alteration characterized by chloritic and argillic altered rock with locally intense silicification and associated adularia.",
      "The veins and silicification are hosted by a dacite dome in the south, a feldspar porphyry and a slightly younger felsic clastic sequence in the north. Gold-silver mineralization was mined a century ago from the Sangre de Cristo vein system in the southeast and to a lesser extent from the smaller Monte Cristo veins in the west. The felsic clastic unit has been interpreted as fine to coarse volcaniclastic debris which filled a rhombic basin with structurally controlled active margins. Several pulses of gold bearing silica-rich fluids migrated up the basin margins and deposited sinter layers within the basin and cemented the NNW and ENE trending basin margin faults and more permeable coarse clastic units with silica. It is these silica-rich bounding faults, silicified permeable units and sub-horizontal sinter layers which are the exploration targets. Please note: The Monte Cristo area does not contain any known reserves and any planned drilling program is exploratory in nature. San Antonio Area Geology\nThe geology at the San Antonio area is similar to La Union-San Jose-San Luis areas. Host rocks include andesites and dacitic tuffs. Outcrops are very sparse. The tuffaceous units are softer, exhibit a more granular sandy texture and do not crop out well. Dacite dikes are rare in comparison to the La Union and San Jose areas. The general strike of the principal mineralized structures and breccia bodies is N30W, with some north-trending step-over structures connecting them. A stockwork zone of varying intensity generally occupies the areas between the major veins. Please note: The San Antonio area does not contain any known reserves and any planned drilling program is exploratory in nature. La Veronica\nThe geological boundary between San Antonio North and the La Veronica area to the north corresponds to another reversal in dip direction of the major mineralized structure(s). Within the La Veronica area, drill data indicates the mineralized fault consistently dips to the east. The exact location of the change in dip direction has not yet been identified."

      "At December 31, 2018 and 2017, an amount of $35,794 has been accrued for the distribution which is included in accrued liabilities. No amount has been accrued for the 2018 distribution due to uncertainties relating to realization of distributions from NyacAU (see Arbitration). At the conclusion of 2017, we were allocated a distribution of $218,770, under #2 above. In accordance with terms of the Operating Agreement, we had the distribution applied toward Loan3. In 2012, the joint venture purchased, on our behalf, a 2% royalty interest, payable on all production from certain of our mining claims at the Chandalar, Alaska property for $250,000 from Jumbo Basin Corporation. This transaction gave rise to Loan3, is carried at an interest rate of the greater of prime plus 2% or 10%, and is to be repaid from distributions to us as defined in the Operating Agreement, prior to any distributions in cash to us. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance due on Loan3 is $95,239. Arbitration\nIn December 2017, we filed an arbitration statement of claim against NyacAU and other parties. The claim challenged certain accounting treatment of capital leases, allocations of tax losses, charges to the JV for funding costs related to the JV managerâs financing, related-party transactions, and other items of dispute in a previous mediation that was unsuccessful in reaching an agreement. As a result, we participated in an arbitration before a panel of three independent arbitrators during 2018 to address these items. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (âASC 450â), we account for loss or gain contingencies when it is probable that a liability or an asset is realizable and can be reasonably estimated. To date, the arbitration proceedings are in progress and no assurance can be given that the arbitration will result in a successful outcome for us. A successful arbitration may result in increases to the 2017 and 2016 distributions and revise the computation of these distributions in 2018. Due to uncertainties relating to the pending outcome, the financial statements contain no adjustments for the final results of the arbitration.",
      "The arbitration is proceeding on the basis that GNP will be dissolved. During the year ended December 31, 2018, management made certain reclassifications from professional services expense, general and administrative expense and other line items on previously reported Consolidated Statements of Operations captions into Arbitration costs. We incurred $1,835,382 and $75,000 in arbitration expenses during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, GNP was required to meet the Minimum Production Requirements as defined by the operating agreement. The Minimum Production Requirement for each year was determined by the price of gold on December 1 in the preceding year. The Minimum Production Requirements for 2016, 2017, and 2018 were 1,100, 1,200, and 1,300 ounces of fine gold, respectively, distributable to each of Goldrich and NyacAU. The Minimum Production Requirements for 2016, 2017, and 2018 were to be substantially paid by October 31, 2018. The value of the combined 2016, 2017 and 2018 Minimum Production Requirements has been calculated at $4,428,000 using the price of gold at $1,230 per ounce at September 30, 2018. GNP did not meet the Minimum Production Requirements. Due to the JVâs failure to meet the Minimum Production Requirement defined in the Operating Agreement, the JV is being dissolved. No financial statement adjustment has been recorded for the failure of the JV to meet the Minimum Production Requirements due to the uncertainties related to the outcome of the currently pending arbitration. NyacAU is entitled to a recorded security interest in all placer gold extraction from our claims as collateral for repayment of fifty percent (50%) of LOC1 and one hundred percent (100%) of Loan3. Planned 2019 Exploration and Mining Activities\nIn 2019, we do not anticipate conducting hard-rock exploration drilling activities and other hard-rock exploration activities at the Chandalar property. We will once again undertake such activities if and when our financial situation permits.",
      "We received $291,913 cash during the year ended December 31, 2012, leaving a net receivable of $324,476 due at December 31, 2012. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2013, the Company received the remaining $324,476. (3)\nGNP leases the equipment from the leasing company in (2) above, an affiliate of NyacAU. The lease rate for the equipment is basically calculated using the depreciated book value for accounting purposes as of December 31, 2011, or the purchase date of each piece of equipment if later, plus a 15% annual return, amortized over a five-year term. At the conclusion of the lease, GNP has the option to purchase the equipment by paying an amount equal to 10% of the purchase price. (4)\nNyacAU had the option to lend the JV $250,000 to purchase an existing 2% royalty agreement on all production from certain Goldrich mining claims. The loan would carry interest at the greater of prime plus 2% or 10% and would be repaid from Goldrichâs portion of production. Goldrich would also have the exclusive right to purchase the royalty at any time. The royalty would be extinguished upon payback of the loan or purchase by Goldrich. The JV exercised the option to purchase the royalty on August 13, 2012, and the 2% royalty was purchased for the contracted $250,000, funded by the loan from NyacAU. (5)\nAs part of his service agreement, the manager of NyacAU was granted 300,000 five-year stock options at an exercise price of $0.20 per share from Goldrichâs employee stock incentive program. The options were issued during the quarter ended June 30, 2012, with the $54,300 fair value of the options accounted for as an increase in our investment in the joint venture. The timing of repayment of the amount to be paid back from production will be affected by timing of gold production by the joint venture. The JV will commence payments to NyacAU as soon as production begins. Our primary exploration asset is the hard-rock exploration target at Chandalar and the terms of the Agreement ensure we will retain access to all of its properties for exploration purposes."

The average rental rates for each of these same years were $716, $704, $688, $679, and $678, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 156 of the 164 Units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 95%. FINANCING\nIn December, 1992 the Partnership borrowed $2,500,000. The loan, secured by a first trust deed against Chandler Villas and guaranteed by the General Partners, bears interest at 5.25% in excess of the seven year treasury yield and all unpaid principal and interest is due on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 1995, the unpaid principal balance was approximately $2,443,000. COMPETITION\nBased on market surveys that conclude that 60% or more of the residents residing in a given facility come from within a 10-mile radius, the primary market for Chandler Villas may be defined by the following cities: Apache Junction, Bapchule, Chandler, Guadalupe, Laveen, Maricopa, Mesa, Ocotillo, Scottsdale, Sun Lakes, and Tempe. The total population of this primary market is 712,812 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications, California, 1996). Assuming that at least 8% of the total population is 65 years of age or older, approximately 57,024 seniors are residing within a 10-mile radius of Chandler Villas. The U. S. Census Bureau, in 1990, reported that 13% of the 65+ population constitutes the primary residential care market, equaling 7,413 seniors in Market Area 2. Currently, there are four facilities in Market Area 2 offering services and features similar to Chandler Villas. These facilities have a combined total of 615 units, potentially housing approximately 676 seniors, or about 9% saturation of the target market. The market may be expanded to 33% or less due to units rented by residents coming from the primary area. Market saturation is also increased by indirect competition from small board and care homes, minimum service senior apartments and residential facilities lacking assisted living services; such facilities are not included in the figures.",

      "Lease expense for 1995 was approximately $284,500. THE INN AT WILLOW GLEN is a 47,717 square foot two story building containing 84 residential units located on 1.5 acres at 1185 Pedro Street, San Jose in a well maintained residential neighborhood. The site is across the street from a racquet club, five miles from the San Jose Civic Center, one half mile from a major freeway joining San Jose to San Francisco and is served by fire protection, emergency health care and other community services. The average occupancy rates during 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, and 1991 were 98%, 97%, 94%, 97%, and 90%, respectively. The average monthly rental rates of occupied units for each of these same years were $1,395, $1,353, $1,284, $1,239, and $1,155, respectively. At March 10, 1996, 82 of the 84 units were occupied for an occupancy rate of 98%. The initial lease term expires in November 1997. The Registrant holds the option to renew for two 10 year periods. Monthly rent, which is fixed for the balance of the initial term, is $16,402, plus bonus rent which is calculated by multiplying $40,000 times the percentage by which annual rents exceed the 1981 base year. Bonus rent for 1995 approximated $1,350 per month, and this amount is not expected to materially increase over the term of the lease. Lease expense for 1995 was approximately $249,300. COMPETITION/MARKETING DATA According to its 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 10.6% of the California population is over 65 years of age, and projects an 8% annual increase in the population over 85 years of age. The Registrant considers this group over the age of 85 to constitute the assisted living population. Census projections for 1995 indicate a population of approximately 3,567,000 people in California over 65, and an assisted living population in California of at least 13% of those over 65 or approximately 463,700. There are five distinct geographic market areas (\"Market Areas\") into which the Registrant's 10 facilities fall. A review of these Market Areas follows."

Government Regulation\nThe Company's business is subject to certain federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the drilling for and production, transportation and marketing of oil and gas, as well as environmental and safety matters. Such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in recent years, often imposing greater liability on an increasing number of parties and in some circumstances creating retroactive liability. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is unable to predict the effect or cost of compliance with such requirements or their effects on oil and gas use or prices. In addition, legislative proposals are frequently introduced in Congress and state legislatures which, if enacted, might significantly affect the oil and gas industry. In view of the many uncertainties which exist with respect to any legislative proposals, the effect on the Company of any legislation which might be enacted cannot be predicted. Hedging Activities\nThe Company utilizes energy swap arrangements and financial futures to reduce sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility. If the Company's reserves are not produced at the rates estimated by the Company due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process, operational difficulties or regulatory limitations, the Company will be required to satisfy obligations it may have under fixed price sales or hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production.",
      "The Company may not be able to find another contractor to provide substantially similar services at the same rates or replicate such services without incurring additional costs. Kaiser-Francis, PetroCorp's largest shareholder, and its subsidiaries explore for and produce oil and gas in some of the same geographic areas in which the Company operates. Kaiser-Francis is not required to pursue a business strategy that will favor PetroCorp business opportunities over the business opportunities of Kaiser-Francis, its affiliates, or any other competitor of PetroCorp acquired by Kaiser-Francis. In fact, Kaiser-Francis may have financial motives to favor itself. In addition, because of the Company's management agreement with Kaiser-Francis, PetroCorp, Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates share, and therefore will compete for, the time and effort of Kaiser-Francis personnel who provide services to the Company. Officers of Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates do not and will not be required to spend any specified percentage or amount of their time on the Company's business. Since these shared officers function as both the Company's representatives and those of Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, conflicts of interest could arise between Kaiser-Francis and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its shareholders, on the other. Hedging Activities\nThe Company periodically utilizes energy swap arrangements and futures transactions to reduce sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility. If the Company's reserves are not produced at the rates estimated by the Company due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process, operational difficulties or regulatory limitations, the Company will be required to satisfy obligations it may have under fixed price sales or hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production. Further, the terms under which the Company enters into fixed price sales and hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation costs to delivery points.",
      "Under these laws and regulations, the Company could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. The Company does not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. For example, Congress or the Minerals Management Service could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas production in some areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. A small number of shareholders control the Company, making it difficult for the Company's other shareholders to affect the Company's management. Directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of the Company, and their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 55% of the Company, including approximately 38% owned by Kaiser-Francis. Accordingly, these shareholders, as a group, will be able to control the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in the Company's articles of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. The existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of the Company's common stock will be able to affect the management or direction of the Company. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of the Company, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of the Company's common stock.",
      "These are often difficult and costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. State statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Most states in which the Company will operate also have statutes and regulations governing conservation matters, including the unitization or pooling of properties and the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells. Many state statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from acquired properties. Some states have also enacted statutes prescribing ceiling prices for natural gas sold within their states. The Company's operations are also subject to numerous laws and regulations governing plugging and abandonment, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The heavy regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its costs of doing business and consequently affects its profitability. Although the Company believes it is in compliance with such laws, rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that a change in such laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Dependence on Key Personnel\nThe business of the Company will depend on the continued services of its chief executive officer, Marshall A. Smith III and its president, Thomas R. Kaetzer. Effective September 9, 1997 and December 14, 1998 respectively, the Company entered into employment agreements with Mr. Smith and Mr. Kaetzer for a period of three years. The loss of the services of Mr. Smith or Mr. Kaetzer would be particularly detrimental to the Company because of their background and experience in the oil and gas industry. Delisting by The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and Boston Stock Exchange\nEffective April 7, 1999 and December 20, 1999, respectively, the Company's common stock was delisted by The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and the Boston Stock Exchange due to the Company's failure to maintain compliance with the net tangible assets standard and the minimum bid price requirement necessary for continued listing.",

Geology\nThe Round Top Project area lies within the Texas Lineament Zone or Trans-Pecos Trend. The lineament is a northwest trending structural zone where Laramide thrust faulting followed by basin and range normal faulting were active. Tertiary igneous activity is also associated with the lineament zone, both intrusive and extrusive. Locally the project area is characterized by five Tertiary microgranite bodies that intruded Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. The microgranites occur as laccoliths, mushroom-shaped bodies emplaced at relatively shallow depths. At the current erosional levels, laccoliths form resistant peaks with relief up to 2,000 feet. The microgranites, which are called rhyolites in the literature, are enriched with various metals which may or not be economical to recover. The rare earth elements are located with-in the intrusive rhyolite body. Tertiary Diorite which predate the microgranites are intruded the cretaceous section. The diorites occur as sills, five to 100 feet thick and less frequently as dikes and plugs."

      "A light green, arsenic rich alteration phase identified as scorodite is also associated with gold mineralization at the Nyamulindira license. A TAG model is being used in an attempt to understand the mineralization where an Intrusion Related Gold system is expected along with skarn and pegmatite host rocks. Mashonga Property\nThe style of gold mineralization at the Mashonga area is associated with shear zones hosted by early-Proterozoic schists which are adjacent to late tin-bearing granite intrusions. An unconformity related gold system is used to model the style of mineralisation, with the younger, mid-Proterozoic Karagwe-Ankolean system forming an unconformable relationaship with the older Buganda Toro system. In the basement schists and granites, a TAG model is being used in an attempt to understand the mineralization where an Intrusion Related Gold system is expected along with skarn and pegmatite host rocks. Artisanal gold production from the Mashonga Mine is reported to come from an east-west trending sheared-quartz vein zone, tentatively interpreted by Magnus to be a splay off a northwest-trending regional structure. The mineralized shear appears to be hosted by quartz-muscovite schist, or at the contact between the schist and granitic rock. Parts of the open cast wallrock are kaolinitized granite with pegmatitic veins and a quartz stockwork. The presence of anomalous platinum group elements (âPGEâ) values in rock samples from the mine area and possibly anomalous Terra Leach soils from further east suggest the gold mineralization in the Buganda-Toro sediments may have a significant PGE association. In the Mashonga area the Company believes there is an IRG style of mineralization. This model takes into account both large veins which occur on the margins of granite bodies as well as granite hosted sheeted, stockwork or pegmatitic veins. In the larger veins such as mined at Mashonga, high gold grades can be expected. An economic deposit, however, is more likely to be a lower grade, granite hosted system which calls for alternative exploration techniques (multi-element geochemistry, IP to detect zones of silicification, magnetic halo anomalies, recognition of metal/element assemblages and unique features such as unidirectional solidification textures, greisens and pegmatites.",
      "Ibanda Property\nThe style of gold mineralization at the Ibanda area is similar to Mashonga, and is also associated with shear zones hosted by early-Proterozoic schists which are adjacent to late tin-bearing granite intrusions. An unconformity related gold system is used to model the style of mineralisation, with the younger, mid-Proterozoic karagwe Ankolean system forming an unconformable relationaship with the older Buganda Toro system. In the basement schists and granites, a TAG model is being used in an attempt to understand the mineralization where an Intrusion Related Gold system is expected along with skarn and pegmatite host rocks. Rubindi Property\nThe style of gold mineralization at the Rubindi area is similar to Mashonga, and is also associated with shear zones hosted by early-Proterozoic schists which are adjacent to late tin-bearing granite intrusions.

In the basement schists and granites, a TAG model is being used in an attempt to understand the mineralization where an Intrusion Related Gold system is expected along with skarn and pegmatite host rocks. Kigumba Property\nThe style of mineralization at the Kigumba area is expected to be related to a large 22km long by up to 4km wide radiometrics anomaly, which was identified from the airborne geophysical survey covering 80% of the country. The uranium response is particularly strong, so the area will be tested initially for uranium potential associated with the sheared limb of a folded sequence. Kidera Property\nThe style of mineralization at the Kidera area is expected to be related to a large 7km by 5km circular radiometrics anomaly, which was identified from the airborne geophysical survey covering 80% of the country. This radiometrics anomaly has a similarity in size to the carbonatite complexes such as Tororo and Sukulu Hills, located in the southeastern part of Uganda."

      "The underground mine at Casa Berardi is a trackless mine accessed by declines and a shaft, which produces approximately 2,300 tons of ore per day. The mining methods are longhole transversal stoping in 10 meters or more mineralization width with good access from nearby development, and longitudinal retreat stoping in narrower ore bodies or long distances from development infrastructure. Longitudinal methods have the advantage of lower waste development requirements; however, there is much less flexibility in sequencing and in access, should ground instabilities occur. Timely supply of both cemented and unconsolidated backfill plays a crucial role in controlling dilution and maintaining a short stoping cycle. We believe this mining method satisfies all of the geotechnical requirements and constraints and, as a non-entry mining method, has proven to be safe and reliable in similar operations. The mineralized zones put in reserves are of varying thickness, ranging from a few tenths of meters to 3 meters, which is the minimum mining width. Most of the hanging walls are sub-vertical (55Â° to 85Â°), with typically the graphitic Casa Berardi fault at the footwall. In 2014, we completed a project initiated by Aurizon to deepen the West Mine Shaft and construct the associated shaft infrastructure, including loading pockets, shaft lining, services and steel. In early 2016, we made the decision to construct the East Mine Crown Pillar (\"EMCP\") open pit, which is just west of the East Mine infrastructure. Stripping and development of the EMCP pit is planned to take place over five stages. The first stage was completed in the first half of 2016, and processing of ore from the EMCP pit began in July 2016. Stripping and development have been ongoing, and the pit is being expanded to the west and is currently in the final stage of development. The EMCP pit uses conventional open pit mining methods, and is expected to run for approximately 4.5 years of production. The average amount of material to be moved every six months is anticipated to be approximately 70,000 to 390,000 tons of ore, with variable quantities of waste."

      "Similarly, no metallurgical testing has been carried out on drill cuttings from the Dixie Flats Property or other types of sampling medium. Dome Property\nThe Dome Property comprises four non-contiguous claim blocks totalling 19 unpatented lode mining claims located in the Cortez-Battle Mt.-Eureka Trend. The claims total approximately 380 acres and are located in the Sheep Creek Range, 20 miles north-northeast of Battle Mountain. The claims cover parts of Section 2 in Township 34 North, Range 46 East, and Sections 26 and 36 in Township 35 North, Range 46 East. The claims which comprise the Dome Property (and the Wild Horse Property) were originally staked by Richard R. Redfern (âRedfernâ) and the Pescios. The Dome Property and the Wild Horse Property were leased by Redfern and the Pescios to Senator Minerals Inc. (âSenatorâ) under the mining lease dated effective January 4, 2004. Redfern holds a 51% interest and the Pescios a 49% interest, in the royalties in the Dome Property. The primary term of the mining lease is 20 years, terminable at any time by Senator upon delivery of notice. Senator may extend the term of the mining lease beyond the primary term by paying a lease payment of $60,000 per year on or before the anniversary date of the mining lease following expiration of the primary term. Under the mining lease, Senator paid the sum of $17,150 to the Pescios together with 20,000 shares of Senatorâs common stock. Under the mining lease, Senator paid the sum of $8,925 to Redfern together with 20,000 shares of Senatorâs common stock.

Prior to commencement of any surface disturbance, permits must be obtained from the appropriate office of the BLM which permits exploration activities such as trenching, drilling or construction of new roads. A reclamation bond must be posted prior to any surface disturbance on the property; however, no EIS is needed to conduct such work in the area in which the property is located. Minterra has not conducted any metallurgical or related tests on any material from the NAD Property and there are no data available from previous operators pertaining to mineral processing or metallurgical testing. North Carlin Property\nThe North Carlin Property lies in the southern portion of the main Carlin Trend, currently the largest and most productive group of gold deposits in North America. The property consists of 36 unpatented lode mining claims comprising\napproximately 720 acres and located in Section 2, T33N, R52E within the Carlin Trend, just 4 miles north of the town of Carlin in Elko County, Nevada. The claim area is entirely covered with Tertiary sediments of the Carlin Formation east of the Carlin Window, and the claims were located to cover the southeast projection of the Carlin Window. The North Carlin Property was sold by the owner, the Pescios to Mill City who optioned it to Minterra along with nine other properties, comprising approximately 12,200 acres of Federal land, in a letter agreement dated September 6, 2004. Minterra has the right to earn a 60% interest in the nine properties by incurring an aggregate of $5,000,000 of exploration and development expenditures on the properties over five years, completing a minimum of 100,000 feet of drilling, and making certain cash reimbursements and issuing shares of common stock to Mill City. Minterra may elect to earn a further 10% interest in any property by completing a bankable feasibility study on the property.",

Pony Creek Property\nThe Pony Creek Property is located in the Larrabee mining district of Elko County, Nevada, in the southern half of the Carlin Trend, 28 miles southeast of the town of Carlin and 19 miles south of Newmont Gold Companyâs Rain Mine. Management of Vista has been advised by the Pescios that the Pony Creek Property consists of 584 unpatented lode mining claims (approximately 11,680 acres). The property is located across the crest of the southern part of the Pinyon Range at elevations ranging from 6,600 feet to about 8,000 feet. Access to the property from the west is by traveling the Indian Pony road off State Highway 278, or from the east via the Red Rock Ranch road off a junction with State highway 228. Pursuant to an agreement with the Pescios, Mill City owns a 100% interest in the property and pays the Pescios a NSR of 3%. Escalating annual property payments must be made to the Pescios and Mill City may purchase 1.0% of the 3.0% NSR for a total of $1 million. Mill City must also pay annual rentals to the BLM of $125 per claim on or before September 1 of each year and appropriate county filing fees to the Elko County Recorder on or before November 1 of each year. If the conditions stated in the option agreement signed July 27, 2004 between Grandview, Mill City and the Pescios are satisfied, then the NSR will be reduced to 2% and Grandview will be given the option to purchase 1% of the 2% NSR, up to the time of commencement of production from the property for $1.5 million."

In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Millstone 3:\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone 3, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast).",
      "With respect to operating nuclear facilities of which it is a part owner or from which it contracts (on terms reflecting such liability) to purchase power, Montaup would be obligated to pay its proportionate share of any such assessment. Decommissioning:\nBoth of the operating nuclear generating companies in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest (see Item 2. PROPERTIES -- Power Supply) have developed their estimates of the cost of decommissioning its unit and have received the approval of FERC to include charges for the estimated costs of decommissioning its unit in the cost of energy which it sells. From time to time, these companies re-estimate the cost of decommissioning and apply to FERC for increased rates in response to increased decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee has filed a decommissioning financing plan under a Maine statute which requires the establishment of a decommissioning trust fund. That statute also provides that if the trust has insufficient funds to decommission the plant, the licensee (Maine Yankee) is responsible for the deficiency and, if the licensee is unable to provide the entire amount, the \"owners\" of the licensee are jointly and severally responsible for the remainder. The definition of \"owner\" under the statute includes Montaup and may include companies affiliated with Montaup. The applicability and effect of this statute cannot be determined at this time. Montaup would seek to recover through its rates any payments that might be required (see \"Yankee Atomic\", and \"Connecticut Yankee\" below). Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone III and Seabrook I. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone III is $18.6 million in 1996 dollars, and Seabrook I is $13.1 million in 1996 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves."

      "A 42-month lease for the entire Bake Parkway Building has been signed by Quest Software, Inc. Occupancy occurred on August 1, 2000. Quest is a publicly traded corporation that provides software database management and disaster recovery services for its clients. Construction of tenant improvements required under the Quest lease cost approximately $1,231,000 and was funded by Wells OP. As of December 31, 2000, Wells OP held a 15.7% equity interest in the Fund VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture. On February 18, 1999, Wells Op entered into a Rental Income Guaranty Agreement with Fund VIII and Fund IX Associates, whereby Wells OP guaranteed the VIII-IX Joint Venture that it would receive rental income on the Bake Parkway Building previously leased to Matsushita Avionics at least equal to the rental and building expenses that the VIII-IX Joint Venture would have received over the remaining term of its original lease with Matsushita Avionics. Under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement, Wells OP also guaranteed that, if a joint venture such as the VIII-IX-REIT Joint Venture was ever formed by the parties for the ownership and operation of the Bake Parkway Building, Wells OP would guarantee to the VIII-IX Joint Venture that it would receive monthly cash flow distributions from such joint venture at least equal to the rent and building expenses guaranteed under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement. Wells OP had paid approximately $595,000 in rental income guaranty payments to the VIII-IX Joint Venture through December 31, 2000, but has since ceased making such payments since the Bake Parkway Building is now fully leased to Quest. Our maximum liability exposure to the VIII-IX Joint Venture for rental income and building expenses potentially payable under this Rental Income Guaranty Agreement of approximately $3,000,000 was taken into account in the economic analysis performed in making the determination to go forward with the development of the Matsushita Building. Although the lease of the Bake Parkway Building by Quest has, at least temporarily, relieved Wells OP of its obligations under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement, we cannot, at this time, determine the amount Wells OP continues to guaranty payment under the Rental Income Guaranty Agreement and, consequently, continues to bear some risk, even though their risk has been substantially minimized by the lease with Quest."

The RS Division successfully completed its negotiations in the first quarter of 1992 to form a joint venture company known as UTS Europe Holding BV (UTS). The new entity, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, has been handling intra-European movement of household goods since March 1, 1992. NAVL has a 40 percent interest in UTS which is comprised of approximately 70 individual shareholders in 65 locations throughout Europe. To date, national and regional organizations have been formed under the UTS banner in Germany and the Netherlands (founding members), with an 8 percent and 5 percent interest in UTS, respectively. In addition, the United Kingdom (8 percent interest in UTS), Belgium (5 percent interest) and the Scandinavian countries (5 percent interest) have also formed under the UTS banner. TRIPLE CROWN OPERATIONS. Until April 1993, Norfolk Southern's intermodal subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc.

These HVP gains were partly offset by shortfalls in RS attributable to volume declines. In 1996, motor carrier revenues were $930 million, up 4 percent from 1995, attributable to gains in both divisions. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS are conducted through NAVL's RS and HVP divisions. In 1997, total domestic shipments for these divisions were 392,455, up 2 percent from 1996. RS - Domestic shipments of used household goods transported by the RS Division fall into three market categories. Approximately 53 percent of the domestic shipment volume comes from the sale of moving services to individual consumers. Another 37 percent comes\nfrom corporations and other businesses that pay for the relocation of their employees."

Geology\nThe Yellow Pine Mining District is located within the Cretaceous age Idaho Batholith, near its eastern border and adjacent to the Meadow Creek fault zone. The gold deposits of the Yellow Pine district are hosted primarily in the quartz monzonites of the Idaho batholith and within the major shear and fault zones that transect the district. Ore deposits also occur in the metasediments of a large roof pendant within the granitic rocks. Historic mining of the Yellow Pine and the Homestake open pits on the Yellow Pine property has depleted the oxide gold mineralization, but significant sulfide gold mineralization remains unmined. Gold and antimony occur principally in veinlets, stockworks, fissure-fillings, and massive lenses. Gold appears to be associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite whereas silver is associated with antimony. The primary gold mineralization occurs within a zone of stockwork sulfide veinlets also containing stibnite, pyrite and arsenopyrite."

      "thereafter\nFaults control alteration and mineralization in volcanics. Targets would be deeper than tested to date. Other companies drilled 122 shallow holes. Contact District\nAllied Nevada, through the acquisition from Vista of the F. W. Lewis, Inc. properties, owns wholly or in fractional interest 110 patented claims in the Contact mining district in northeast Elko County, Nevada. We also staked 307 unpatented claims adjacent to the patented claims in early July 2007. There are no royalties associated with our ownership of both the patented and unpatented mining claims. The small settlement of Contact is located approximately 52 miles north of Wells, Nevada and 16 miles south of Jackpot, Nevada. The mining district is immediately west of the town of Contact and extends for several miles west and southwest of town. The mining district, referred to as either the âContactâ or âSalmon Riverâ district, was discovered in the early 1870s and was first worked for gold and silver. However, copper was soon discovered and the vast majority of the historic work in the district has been directed toward the development and production of copper ores. Early work in the district was hampered by the inaccessibility of the area and the resultant high shipping costs for any ore produced. The later construction of the railroad eliminated this problem, but falling copper prices in the 1930s caused the district to cease production. The district saw a renewed period of activity in the 1940s and early 1950s, but little true exploration work was done and most efforts were directed toward mining already known ore deposits. More recently, various companies have looked at the district for precious metals in the 1980s and 1990s, and higher copper and molybdenum prices have recently renewed interest in those prospects. Geology\nThe area is underlain by a granodiorite batholith and related rocks of Mesozoic age which intruded a Late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of shale and limestone. Contact metamorphism and metasomatism produced skarns and hornfels in the sediments up to a mile away from the contact zone.",
      "High-grade precious and base metal mineralization occurs along these contact metamorphic zones. The intrusion of the porphyry and alaskite was apparently centered near the North Contact Zone. This intrusion further metamorphosed the sedimentary rocks and culminated in a wave of copper mineralization that not only affected the contact zones, but mineralized masses of porphyry and alaskite. Various companies, including Phelps Dodge Company in the early 1970s and Golden Phoenix in the early 1990s and their engineering and geological staffs have estimated the mineralization in the district and published historic mineralization estimates. These estimates are based on drilling primarily in and around the Banner Zone, the center of which is located approximately one mile west-northwest of town. There has been recent drilling in the Zone by another company and Allied Nevada controls patented claims on the west and east ends of the Banner Zone. Although Allied Nevada has not conducted any drilling on the property, our geologic staff is in the process of evaluating the potential of the district and will review business opportunities that might develop. Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property\nThe Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property is located in the Larrabee mining district of Elko County, Nevada, in the southern half of the Carlin Trend, 28 miles southeast of the town of Carlin and 19 miles south of Newmont Gold Companyâs Rain Mine. The Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property consists of 895 unpatented lode mining claims (approximately 17,900 acres). The property is located across the crest of the southern part of the Pinyon Range at elevations ranging from 6,600 feet to about 8,000 feet. Access to the property from the west is by traveling the Indian Pony road off State Highway 278, or from the east via the Red Rock Ranch road off a junction with State highway 228. Pursuant to an agreement with the Pescios, Mill City owns a 100% interest in the property and was to pay the Pescios a NSR of 3%. Escalating annual property payments would have to be made to the Pescios and Mill City may purchase 1.0% of the 3.0% NSR for a total of $1 million.",
      "Volcanic rocks have been block-faulted by dominant north-trending structures, which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization. The Central Fault and East Fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation. A post-mineral range-front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent Pleistocene Lahontan Lake sediments in the Black Rock Desert. The known gold mineralization within the Crofoot and Lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north-south direction by 1.5 miles in an east-west direction. Mineralization extends to a depth of less than 330 feet in the outcropping to near-outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over 1,000 feet in the Brimstone deposit in the east. Not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization. We currently have 26 patented claims that comprise approximately 1,600 acres and 2,349 unpatented claims that comprise approximately 46,400 acres. Combining the patented and unpatented claims, our claims total approximately 48,000 acres. This claim package was acquired by the Company in a series of transactions:\nâ¢\nThe Crofoot property and approximately 3,500 acres of claims were acquired by Vista in 1988.

      "On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. Wellhead sales of domestic natural gas are not subject to regulation. Consequently, sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation, and sales. In addition, the FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCâs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation of the natural gas industry. The ultimate impact of the rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial decisions and final decisions by the FERC. New proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts.",
      "Federal Natural Gas Regulation\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the âFERCâ) is primarily responsible for federal regulation of natural gas.

      "While natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. FERC has promulgated regulations to implement the Energy Policy Act, including enforcement rules and new annual reporting requirements for certain sellers of natural gas. It is impossible to predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Federal Regulation of Oil\nSales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs. Under rules adopted by FERC effective January 1995, interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index, though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances. On December 19, 2007, the President signed into law the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 (PL 110-140). The EISA, among other things, prohibits market manipulation by any person in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale in contravention of such rules and regulations that the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe, directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the regulations, and establishes penalties for violations thereunder. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids facilities, sales or transportation transactions."

      "G&M has incurred $5,275,916 in exploration costs, commencing January 1, 1994 through September 30, 2013, and the Company has incurred $4,217,702 in exploration costs, from its inception on July 26, 2002 through September 30, 2013. The foregoing exploration costs include those costs associated with drilling, assaying, filing fees, extraction process development, consultant, geological, metallurgical, chemist, environmental and legal fees, and other miscellaneous property development costs. The following describes the Companyâs historical extraction and analysis of samples from the El Capitan Property. Over the years, samples taken on the El Capitan Property, including samples taken by ECL, have given low-grade precious metal results when using standard fire assay methods. Through August 2006, due to the unique nature of the mineralization of the El Capitan Property, we have at times utilized testing and assaying methods that may be uncommon, including the use of alkali fusion assays, a more aggressive form of assay which completely converts the sample into a water soluble salt. In January 2005, ECL completed a preliminary 32-sample surface sampling and assay program on the El Capitan Property to determine the propertyâs gold and platinum potential. This preliminary sampling was completed by Dr. Clyde L. Smith, Ph.D. This preliminary sampling and assay program was followed by three stages of diamond drilling and rotary drilling, totaling 45 holes between April 2005 and September 2006. In 2007, ECPN engaged Dr. Smith to prepare a report to âprovide an explanation of the work conducted on the El Capitan Gold-Platinum Project ... and to summarize the results of the geologic investigations ...â In this report, dated April 16, 2007, Dr. Smith states, âThis resource [the El Capitan Property] qualifies as a âmeasured resourceâ based upon the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 guidelines. Preliminary hydrometallurgical extraction results indicate potentially acceptable levels of recovery of both gold and platinum.â",
      "We have successfully utilized a repeatable concentration and recovery procedure, which is a modified fire assay technique, to allow evaluation of the mineralized material. Results using this procedure have been positive and show potential economically feasible mineralized material. The Company has not filed any geological reports on SEDAR for review by Canadian authorities and does not intend to do so. The Company and Gold and Minerals Company, Inc. (âG&Mâ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, have incurred a total of $10,907,023 in exploration and mine development costs associated with the El Capitan Property. G&M incurred $5,275,916 in exploration costs from January 1, 1994 through January 19, 2011, at which time it was merged into the Company, and the Company has incurred $5,631,107 in exploration costs from its inception on July 26, 2002 through September 30, 2014. The foregoing exploration and mine development costs include costs associated with drilling, assaying, filing fees, extraction process development, consultant, geological, metallurgical, chemist, environmental and legal fees, and other miscellaneous property exploration costs have been expensed as required under the SEC Industry Guide 7. Current\nIn 2014, we utilized and verified the three recovery processes on the El Capitan Property mineralized material: cyanide leaching utilizing various pre-step ore processing, silver - lead inquarting, and the fine grind and magnetic separation method. The final verification process is to ensure that value of the El Capitan Property mineralized materials is sufficient so that the costs of the recovery process are not prohibitive in comparison to the price of the precious metals recoverable at the El Capitan Property. Based upon the test results that utilized the fine-grinding and separation method, we moved forward with our strategic plan for a limited-scale continued mineral exploration at the El Capitan Property site in New Mexico in support of the sale of that property.",

      "In a typical hedging transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference. The Company would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether the Company's production was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. In addition, the index used to calculate the floating price in a hedge is frequently not the same as the prices actually received for the production hedged. The difference (referred to as basis differential) may be material, and may reduce the benefit or increase the detriment caused by a particular hedge. There is not an established pricing index for hedges of California heavy crude oil production, and the cash market for heavy oil production in California tends to vary widely from index prices typically used in oil hedges. Consequently, prior to 2000, hedging California heavy crude oil was particularly subject to the risks associated with volatile basis differentials. In February 2000, the Company entered into a 15-year contract, effective January 1, 2000, to sell all of its current and future California crude oil production to Tosco Corporation. The contract provides pricing based on a fixed percentage of the NYMEX crude oil price for each type of crude oil that Nuevo produces in California. While the contract does not reduce the Company's exposure to price volatility, it does effectively eliminate the basis differential risk between the NYMEX price and the field price of the Company's California oil production, thereby facilitating Nuevo's ability to hedge its realized prices. NUEVO ENERGY COMPANY\nCompetition/Markets for Production\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration, exploitation, development and production.",
      "Hedging\nThe Company periodically seeks to reduce its exposure to price volatility by hedging its production through swaps, options and other commodity derivative instruments. In a typical hedging transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference.

Consequently, hedging California heavy crude oil is particularly subject to the risks associated with volatile basis differentials. Competition; Markets for Production\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration, exploitation, development and production. The availability of funds and information relating to a property, the standards established by the Company for the minimum projected return on investment, the availability of alternate fuel sources and the intermediate transportation of gas are factors which affect the Company's ability to compete in the marketplace. The Company's competitors include major integrated oil companies and a substantial number of independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial and other resources than the Company.",
      "In addition, reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. In calculating reserves on a gas equivalent basis, oil was converted to gas equivalent at the ratio of one Bbl of oil to six Mcf of gas. While this ratio approximates the energy equivalency of oil to gas on a Btu basis, it may not represent the relative prices received by the Company on the sale of its oil and gas production. The estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to estimated proved reserves set forth herein were prepared in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves. Hedging of Production ---------------------\nThe Company may, from time to time, reduce its exposure to the volatility of oil and gas prices by hedging a portion of its production. In a typical hedge transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge, the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged. In such case, the Company is required to pay the difference regardless of whether the Company has sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require the Company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production. Hedging will also prevent the Company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge. BELLWETHER EXPLORATION COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES -----------------------------------------------\nOperating Hazards, Offshore Operations and Uninsured Risks ----------------------------------------------------------\nBellwether's operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas industry, such as: 1) blowouts, 2) cratering, 3) explosions, 4) uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, 5) fires, 6) pollution, 7) earthquakes and 8) environmental risks.",
      "The Company's private ownership of oil and gas reserves under oil and gas leases in the United States differs distinctly from its ownership of foreign oil and gas properties. In the foreign countries in which the Company does business, the state generally retains ownership of the minerals and consequently retains control of (and in many cases, participates in) the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the United States, and estimates of reserves attributable to properties located outside the United States, may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges. Hedging\nDuring 1999, the Company formalized its policies regarding the management of price risk to ensure the Company's ability to optimally manage its portfolio of investment opportunities. In a typical swap transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference. The Company would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether the Company's\nNUEVO ENERGY COMPANY\nproduction was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge.

      "In North Dakota, we maintain transmission facilities to interconnect with electric transmission lines of other utilities and share in the ownership of Coyote I Electric Generating Plant (`Coyote'), located near Beulah, North Dakota. In Iowa, we share in the ownership of Neal Electric Generating Unit No. 4 (`Neal'), located near Sioux City, Iowa. These facilities are fueled by coal, which is provided through various length contracts with several coal companies. We are evaluating additional generation which will provide adequate generating capacity reserves through the year 2000. Currently, we have capacity options for the years 2001-2007. Because the cost of capacity has risen significantly and also because of the reduced availability of capacity in the future, NorthWestern Public Service is developing a comprehensive plan to assure that it has sufficient capacity to meet customer needs and the reserve requirements of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (`MAPP'). Capability and Demand\nAs of December 31, 1998, the aggregate net summer peaking capacity of all NorthWestern Public Service-owned electric generating units was 308,289 kw, consisting of 104,420 kw from Big Stone (our 23.4% share), 42,700 kw from Coyote (our 10.0% share), 54,169 kw from Neal (our 8.7% share), and 107,000 kw from internal combustion turbine units and small diesel units, used primarily for providing electric power during peak demand periods. In addition to those plant facilities, we have entered into agreements to purchase up to 14,950 kw of firm capacity from Basin Electric Cooperative and various amounts from Nebraska Public Power District to assist in meeting peak demands. We are a summer peaking utility. The 1998 peak demand of 276,976 kw occurred on July 14, 1998. Total system capability at the time of peak was 333,589 kw. The reserve margin for 1998 was 20%. The minimum reserve margin requirement as determined by the members of the MAPP, of which we are a member, is 15%. MAPP is an area power pool arrangement consisting of utilities and power suppliers having transmission interconnections located in a 9-state area in the north central region of the United States and in two Canadian provinces.",
      "Following test burns in 1990 and 1991, the owners of the Big Stone Plant received approval from the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources to burn tire derived fuel (`TDF') and refuse derived fuel (`RDF'). The quantity of TDF and RDF that was burned in 1998 was less than 5% of the total fuel consumption at the plant. The fossil fuel supplies for Big Stone and Neal are delivered via unit trains belonging to the respective plants' owners and locomotives of the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad, respectively. The lignite supply for Coyote is delivered via conveyor at this `mine-mouth' plant. In early 1996, the partners at Big Stone executed a fifteen year operating lease agreement for aluminum unit train cars. This agreement was effective late in 1996. The prior unit train cars were sold to another third party independent of the leasing transaction. While we have no firm contract for diesel fuel for our other electric generating plants, we have been able to purchase our diesel fuel requirements in recent years from local suppliers and currently have in storage an amount adequate to satisfy our normal requirements for such fuel. Additional information relating to jointly owned plants is incorporated by reference to Note 7 of the `Notes to Consolidated Statements' of the Company's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders filed as an Exhibit 13 hereto. COMPETITION\nDirect competition does not presently exist within NorthWestern Public Service's assigned electric territory for the supply and delivery of electricity. Providers of electricity compete with each other to some extent to attract and retain customers to their assigned service areas. In addition, some degree of competition exists with the ability of some customers to self-generate or by-pass parts of our electric system. However, to date these threats of competition have not been prevalent in our electric territory. Competition for various aspects of electric services is being introduced throughout the country that will open utility markets to new providers of some or all the traditional utility services.",
      "Item 2. Properties). The company's 1997 peak system net load occurred on July 24, 1997 and amounted to 1,868 MW. The company's net generating capacity together with power available from firm interchange and purchase contracts, provided a capacity margin of approximately 19% above system peak responsibility at the time of the peak. The company and twelve companies in Kansas and western Missouri have agreed to provide capacity (including margin), emergency and economy services for each other. This arrangement is called the MOKAN Power Pool. The pool participants also coordinate the planning of electric generating and transmission facilities. The company is one of 54 members of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP). SPP's responsibility is to maintain system reliability on a regional basis. The region encompasses areas within the eight states of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. In 1994, the company joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP). Under this arrangement, over 172 electric utilities and marketers throughout the western United States have agreed to market energy and to provide transmission services. WSPP's intent is to increase the efficiency of the interconnected power systems operations over and above existing operations. Services available include short-term and long-term economy energy transactions, unit commitment service, firm capacity and energy sales, energy exchanges, and transmission service by intermediate systems. During 1994, the company entered into an agreement with Midwest Energy, Inc. (MWE), whereby the company will provide MWE with peaking capacity of 61 MW through the year 2008. The company also entered into an agreement with Empire District Electric Company (Empire), whereby the company will provide Empire with peaking and base load capacity (20 MW in 1994 increasing to 80 MW in 2000) through the year 2000. Future Capacity\nThe company does not contemplate any significant expenditures in connection with construction of any major generating facilities for the next five years.",

(2) Winter ratings of UI nuclear and Hydro-Quebec interconnection's equivalent capacity value entitlements (megawatts): Millstone Unit 3 - 42.22 Seabrook Unit 1 - 203.35 Hydro-Quebec - 34.34 (3) At the time of 1997 summer peak, Millstone Unit 3 still retained capability rating for the purposes of satisfying UI's required capacity as a NEPOOL participant. It is assumed that unit will be back in operation by the time of 1998 summer peak. (4) UI's required capacity as a NEPOOL participant. (5) Total generating resources, excluding purchases from New York Power Authority and Shelton Landfill, less capability responsibility. In addition, UI maintains two units (English Station 7 and 8) in deactivated reserve, representing a total of 72.55 MW of generating capacity.\n- 19 -\nDuring 1997, the peak load on the Company's system was approximately 1,173 megawatts, which occurred in July. UI's total generating capability at the time was 1,356 megawatts, including a 98 megawatt increase in capability provided by the equivalent capacity value of UI's entitlements in the Hydro-Quebec facility and reflecting the net effect of temporary arrangements with other electric utilities and cogenerators. The Company is currently forecasting an annual average compound growth in peak load of 0.8% during the period 1997 to 2007. Based on current forecasts of loads, UI's generating capability will exceed its projected July-August capability responsibility to NEPOOL for generating capacity through at least 1999, and English Station Units 7 and 8 can be reactivated if higher than anticipated load growth occurs. If, due to the permanent loss of a generating unit or higher than expected load growth, UI's own generating capability becomes inadequate to meet its capability responsibility to NEPOOL, UI expects to be able to reduce the load on its system by the implementation of additional demand-side management programs, to acquire other demand-side and supply-side resources, and/or to purchase capacity from other utilities or from the installed capability spot market, as necessary."

      "We anticipate moving the rig to Upton County and drilling 10-11 wells. Consistent with previously released guidance, we anticipate drilling 16 gross / 14.8 net operated wells and spudding an additional 5 gross / 3.7 net operated wells during 2021. Eagle Ford Trend\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 26,400 gross (12,500 net) leasehold acres primarily in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of south Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations. Our working interests range from approximately 12% to 67%. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 103 gross Eagle Ford wells and 12 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in five gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk wells. We have identified a total of 26 potential gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our oil and natural gas reserves were located in the state of Texas. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling and completion operations. Our reserve estimates have been prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc.

      "We serve as the operator with a range of approximately 16% to 50% undivided ownership interest in substantially all of the acreage. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 91 gross Eagle Ford wells and 12 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in five gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk well. We have identified a total of approximately 165 potential gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey. We have a non-operated position in 25,097 gross (2,863 net) acres within La Salle County, Texas. The acreage is prone to natural gas and condensate produced from the Eagle Ford formation. The two areas are summarized below:\na)\nWhite Kitchen - We have an average working interest of approximately 15% in 7,075 gross acres, all of which is held by production. As of December 31, 2017, 30 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 40 potential additional drilling locations. b)\nMartin Ranch - We have a 10% working interest in 18,022 gross acres.

      "As of March 29, 2010, Magnum Hunter Resources had over 20,000 gross acres leased in the Eagle Ford Shale within the up-dip oil trend in Atascosa, Gonzales, Lee and Fayette counties, Texas. At March 20, 2010, we controlled approximately 15,000 net acres of Eagle Ford Shale and operate all of our Eagle Ford Shale properties. We have identified approximately 35 horizontal Eagle Ford Shale drilling locations. Working interest varies from 50% in Lee and Fayette Counties, Texas to 100% in Gonzales and Atascosa Counties, Texas. In February 2010, as part of the Companyâs ongoing evaluation of the Eagle Ford Shale, we fraced and tested a vertical Eagle Ford Shale well, the Barbara Ann Unit #1, in Lee County, Texas. We believe that frac stimulation is the most important element in the successful completion of these shale wells and understanding frac dynamics within these shales using existing vertical wells will allow us to better plan completions within our proposed horizontal wells. Our South Texas acreage has conventional oil and natural gas potential derived from both the Austin Chalk and Wilcox formations. Our Eberstadt # 1 well, located in the South Caesar Field of Bee County, Texas, began flowing to sales on February 1, 2010 with a daily production rate of approximately 1,500 Mcf, producing from a gross 100 foot thick section of the middle Wilcox formation. We believe that at least two additional Wilcox wells can be drilled offsetting the Eberstadt #1. We have budgeted an estimated $6.95 million in capital expenditures for 2010 associated with leasing new acreage and the drilling of two horizontal wells, which are currently expected to commence in the second quarter of 2010. We are also exploring multiple Joint Venture opportunities with third parties in the Eagle Ford Shale. South Louisiana / East Chalkley\nOur East Chalkley field is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The unit consists of approximately 714 gross acres. This developmental project is an exploitation of bypassed oil reserves remaining in a natural gas field located at depths between 9,300 feet and 9,400 feet.",
      "The Starbuck Midale has produced 584,000 barrels of oil and the Berentson has produced 754,000 barrels on primary recovery, for total field production of 1,267,000 barrels of oil. We also have successfully unitized the Southwest Starbuck Madison Unit which includes 560 gross acres. In this unit, we have a 98% working interest, a 75% net revenue interest and have completed the initial phase of water flood operations in connection with phase two of the larger Starbuck Madison Unit. For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the production net to our interest from these two units was approximately 65 BOE/day and was 100% oil. Production is expected to increase should flood response be successful. Chittim Field - We have 12,822 gross (6,411 net) acres in this field, located in Maverick County, Texas. The field presently produces out of the Glen Rose interval and the upside potential includes an additional three proved and probable undeveloped locations. The Maverick Basin, however, has additional plays and targets including the\nIndex to Financial Statements\nPearsall and Eagle Ford shale. We have included in our capital budget one horizontal offset well to a vertical Pearsall well that produced. We believe horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques offer the potential to make the Pearsall meaningful to us. The commercial viability of the Eagle Ford shale is currently unknown but there is significant activity in the area. We will monitor the drilling and development efforts of other operators before we commit drilling dollars to development. Our acreage is held by production and therefore, we have no pending lease obligations or expirations. For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the production net to our interest in this field was approximately 989Mcfe/day and was approximately 98% natural gas. Giddings Field - Our Giddings field properties are located in Brazos, Burleson, Fayette, Grimes, Lee, Montgomery and Washington Counties, Texas. We operate all of these properties, which consist of 66 gross wells that are producing from the Cretaceous Austin Chalk interval."

Drilling is also expected to refine the intermediate vein package at the 6500 level and upgrade 30 Vein resources on the eastern end of the deposit. These adjacent veins are roughly defined as intermediate veins which have become an increasingly significant component of the mineâs production mix within the life of mine plan.

      "As discussed further below, production at Lucky Friday was temporarily suspended during 2012. In 2011, ore was processed at an average rate of approximately 905 tons per day. During 2011, mill recovery totaled approximately 93% silver, 93% lead and 87% zinc. All silver-lead and zinc concentrate production during 2011 was shipped to Teck Cominco Limitedâs smelter in Trail, British Columbia, Canada. Underground exploration activities were suspended at the Lucky Friday unit during 2012 as rehabilitation of the Silver Shaft was completed (discussed below). During 2012 all the reserves models were converted from 2D to 3D to allow better representation of the ore zones and allow improved mining stope designs. In-fill drilling in 2013 from 6800 to 7300 Levels is expected to allow for the potential addition of reserves in the western portion of the mine. Exploration drilling has shown the pervasive continuity of mineralization at depth and encouraging results confirmed expansion to the east. In 2013, drilling is expected to evaluate areas to the east from 6400 to 7200 Levels. Surface exploration in the Silver Valley, near the Lucky Friday mine, focused in the Star-Morning area but also evaluated the Noonday, Moffat, You Like and Tamarack veins. Additional surface exploration drilling is planned for 2013. Based on current estimates of reserves, mineralized material, and other resources, the currently expected mine life at the Lucky Friday is approximately 26 years. Information with respect to the Lucky Friday unitâs production, average cost per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves for the past three years is set forth in the table below.

      "The strike of the vein system is west-northwest with a dip of 85 degrees to the south. The 30-vein, which has demonstrated to contain higher silver grades, represents approximately 79% of our current proven and probable ore reserve tonnages, while the remaining 21% of our reserves are contained in various intermediate veins having lower silver grades than 30-vein. While the veins share many characteristics with the Lucky Friday vein, the Gold Hunter area possesses some mineralogical and rock mechanics differences that make it more favorable to mine at this time. On November 6, 2008, we, through Silver Hunter, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Independence Lead Mines Company, which held an interest in the Gold Hunter property. The acquisition included all future interests or royalty obligations to Independence and the mining claims pertaining to the operating agreement with Hecla Limited that was assigned to Silver Hunter. The principal mining method at the Lucky Friday unit is ramp access, cut and fill. This method utilizes rubber-tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the ore body. Once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein, it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed, either above or below, from the ramp system. Ore at the Lucky Friday is processed using a conventional lead/zinc flotation flow sheet, with process control guided by a real-time on-line analyzer. Run of mine ore is crushed in a conventional three stage crushing plant consisting of a primary jaw crusher, and a secondary crushing circuit, and tertiary cone crushing stage. Crushed ore is ground in a ball mill, and the ground slurry reports to the lead flotation circuit. The lead circuit tailings report to the zinc flotation circuit. Lead and zinc concentrates are thickened and filtered, and final concentrate products are shipped to smelters for final processing. Current processing capacity of the Lucky Friday facility is approximately 1,000 tons per day."

We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which she is to be indemnified, we must indemnify her against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. In so far as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to Nevada law or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

The Nevada Revised Statutes allow a company to indemnify our officers, directors, employees, and agents from any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, except under certain circumstances. Indemnification may only occur if a determination has been made that the officer, director, employee, or agent acted in good faith and in a manner, which such person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation. A determination may be made by the stockholders; by a majority of the directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding confirmed by opinion of independent legal counsel; or by opinion of independent legal counsel in the event a quorum of directors who were not a party to such action, suit, or proceeding does not exist. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the company, we have been advised by our special securities counsel that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable.

At the end of the 25-year terms, which commenced in March 2013 (prior to being assumed by PWTS), the tenants have certain renewal options, with terms to be mutually agreed upon. PW Regulus Solar, LLC (âPWRSâ) is a California limited liability company that owns approximately 447 acres of land leased to a utility scale solar farm with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 82 Megawatts in Kern County, California near Bakersfield.",
      "The PSP Lease prohibits the retail sale of the tenantâs cannabis and cannabis-infused products from the PW MF Properties. The annual straight-line annual rent of approximately $579,000 represents an estimated yield of approximately 18.9%. The project is currently under construction and is targeted to be completed by August 2021. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, PW Tam MF recorded rental income of approximately $121,000. On December 4, 2020, PW CO CanRE Tam 19, LLC (âPW Tam 19â), one of our indirect subsidiaries, acquired a 2.11 acre property in Crowley County, Colorado approved for cannabis cultivation for $75,000 (the âTam 19 Propertyâ). As part of the transaction, the PW Tam 19 agreed to fund the immediate construction of a 13,728 square foot greenhouse and two 2,400 square foot ancillary buildings on the Tam 19 Property for $1,236,116. Accordingly, the Trustâs total capital commitment will be approximately $1,311,000. Concurrent with the acquisition, PW Tam 19 entered into a triple-net lease (the âGM Leaseâ) with Green Mile Cultivation, LLC (âGMâ) which is responsible for paying all expenses related to the Tam 19 Property including maintenance expenses, insurances and taxes. The term of the lease is 20 years and provides two options to extend for additional five-year periods. The GM Lease also has financial guarantees from affiliates of GM. GM intends to operate as a licensed cannabis cultivation and processing facility. The rent for the GM Lease is structured whereby after a deferred-rent period, the rental payments provide PW Tam 19 a full return of invested capital over the next three years in equal monthly payments. Thereafter, rent is structured to provide a 12.9% return based on invested capital with annual rent increases of 3% rate per annum. At any time after year six, if cannabis is legalized at the federal level in the United States, the rent will be adjusted down to an amount equal to a 9% return on the original invested capital amount and will increase at a 3% rate per annum based on a starting date of the start of year seven."

      "No electrical power is required at this stage of exploration. Any electrical power that might be required in the foreseeable future could be supplied by gas powered portable generators. Property Geology\nThe Alice Claim is underlain by volcanics of the Yellowknife group, consisting of greenstone flows. These greenstones are fine to coarse grained and the flows vary in thickness up to 175 feet separated in places by tuffs and often on the western side by prominent flow breccia horizons. The lavas take the form of massive, pillowed, schistose, ropey and foliated flows, though distinction is often difficult as pillows have mostly been obscured. The tuffs that are contained in the flows vary in thickness up to 50 feet, and where sheared form sericite schist, whilst chlorite schist forms from the greenstones. The sericitc schist commonly weathers rusty brown due to the presence of pyrite and in some cases gold is associated with mineralization. A number of cherty bands and/or acid and/or acid dykes up to six feet thick occur on the property and often mineralization is associated with them. They may be rusty brown and have quartz veins nearby. These mineralized veins are to a large degree concentrated in a central zone running north/south through the property and the Alice zone, although associated with sheared tuff, lies within this larger area. Acid and intermediate tuffs occur on the western edge of the greenstone whilst on the eastern side the pyroclastic zone is of agglomerate often containing large bombs. Dykes and masses of intrusive diorite and gabbro are present though in some less exposed areas these may be confused with large grained or altered flows. The Alice shear is considered to contain the most promising gold mineralization on the property. This zone lies on the north side of a small lake known as Gold Lake and is exposed in outcrop and trenches for about 900 feet. The shear follows a band of chert-like inter-flow tuff that varies in thickness from a few inches to 6.5 feet.",
      "Drilling is recommended to test the subsurface continuity and gold content of the rock units. 5. Geology\nThe Eagle Creek property is located within the same regional geology as the Ester Dome property. The Eagle Creek property is 90% underlain by late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks that have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. Dominant lithologies are quartz mica schist, micaceous quartzite, graphitic phyllite and chlorite schist, with lesser calc-schist, feldspathic schist, graphitic schist and minor quartz sericite schist. The remaining 10% of the property is underlain by felsic igneous rocks which intrude the schists in all sectors of the property. Compositions range from biotite quartz monzonite to muscovite granite. Porphyritic phases with quartz and feldspar phenocrysts are ubiquitous. Contact relations observed from mapped distribution of granitic rock fragments in soil and from diamond drill core indicate the intrusives are dikes and sills up to 200â thick. FEDERAL CLAIM MAINTENANCE FEES AND STATE CLAIM RENTALS We pay an annual federal claim maintenance fee to the Bureau of Land Management (âBLMâ) for each federal mineral claim that is owned by us or held under a purchase or lease agreement. We paid aggregate annual federal claim maintenance fees of $94,080 in 2009, $84,000 in 2008 and $83,750 in 2007 to BLM; in addition, the Company paid $18,805 to BLM in 2007 for staking new claims. We pay an annual Alaska state claim rentals to the Alaska Department of Revenue for each state mining claim that is owned or held by us under a purchase or lease agreement. We paid aggregate annual Alaska state claim rental fees of $21,930 in 2009 and $16,770 in fiscal 2008 and 2007.\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS The definitions of geological and technical terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are provided below:\nAmphibolite Facies\nAn assemblage of minerals formed under medium to high pressure during regional metamorphism\nArsenopyrite\nMineral composed of iron, arsenic and sulphur.",
      "Locally, rock formations strike generally at 300 degrees, and dip steeply to the southwest. Rocks within the central claim area are predominantly composed of tholeiitic metavolcanics that structurally vary from massive to foliated flows. Quartz veins or âpodsâ within flow units are common. Bordering the tholeiitic metavolcanics along southwest boundary of the property are calc-alkalic metavolcanics frequently containing quartz veins and felsic lapilli. Bordering the tholeiitic metavolcanics to the northeast are the Late Archean orthogneissic rocks of the Kenogamissi Granitic Complex. These rocks are quite heterogeneous and are of amphibolite metamorphic rank. Numerous batholiths and plutons of tonalite, granodiorite and granitic composition are found with the complex. The complex was emplaced into the greenstone rocks of the Swayze belt as a dome and caused a deformation aureole of severe flattening and recumbent folding. It is within these highly strained rocks that the gold mineralization of the St. Jerome mine immediately southwest of the Garrett property, and the gold mineralization of the Trelawney Corporation Chester complex to the southeast is found. The company has completed exploration work on the property, inclusive of 60 kilometers of line cutting, Geophysical Survey in the form of both Very Low Frequency - Electro Magnetic Survey and MAG Survey in the areas that have been subject to line cutting to establish a visible grid for data interpretation. The present condition of the property is âgrass rootsâ in that much of the property area is covered by undisturbed boreal forest and muskeg typical of the Canadian north. At present infrastructure exists on the property in the form of an exploration camp for housing workers on the property, inclusive of a power generation station, semi permanent exploration camp with housing for up to 24 individual workers at a time, a dining and sanitary tent, complete with indoor bath facilities and satellite communications equipment. The property contains a logging road with structural improvements, including bridges and culverts to make the area easily accessible (apart from these improvements, no other subsurface improvements are required at the property to complete additional exploration work).",
      "The shear zone ranges in width from 1 foot to approximately 20 feet. The rocks within the zone are sericite and chlorite schist, and scattered veinlets and lenses of quartz. The average width of the well-mineralized section of the zone is from 2 to 3 feet and it has a length of about 500 feet. Gold occurs sporadically in the heavily pyritized part of the zone. Previous Exploration\nThe area was first prospected in the summer of 1938. Gold was found in July of that year and claims were staked on the more promising showings. The property was acquired by Sunset Yellowknife Mines in 1945 and in the spring and summer of that year, this company did extensive trenching and diamond drilling on the two zones. A total of 1907 feet of diamond drilling was done on the Alice shear north of Gold lake. Operations then ceased out but were resumed in February of 1946 and continued through to November of that year. A camp erected, and in the fall of 1946 a two-compartment vertical shaft was sunk to a depth of 23 feet on the Alice shear zone. In March of 1947, a small mining plant was moved to the property and during the following summer the shaft in the Alice zone was deepened to 145 feet. Drifts were opened on the 125-foot level and extended about 100 feet north and south from the shaft before the property closed on September 10th, 1947. No work was done by the company after September, 1947. Early in 1966, the claims were optioned by Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd. who carried out a geological mapping, geological surveying and short hole diamond drill program on new untested zones. The option was allowed to lapse. No work has been done on the property since that time. Proposed Exploration Work - Plan of Operation\nMr. Glen C. Macdonald, P. Geol., authored the \"Geological Report on the Alice Claimâ dated November, 2006 (the âMacdonald Reportâ), in which he recommended an exploration program to evaluate the potential of the claim. Mr. Macdonald is a registered Professional Geologist in good standing in the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia and the Association of Professional Engineers of Alberta.",
      "Access to our claims is via road and exploration trails. No electrical power is required at this stage of exploration. Gas powered portable generators could supply any electrical power that might be required in the foreseeable future. The topography and relief of the Portage Claims is fairly rugged. Most of the property is above the tree line. Vegetation on the property consists of black and western spruce, poplar, alder and willow in the valleys to ground cover consisting of moss, alpine plants and dwarf birch above 4,000 feet in elevation. An interior intercontinental climate, with moderate to low precipitation of approximately 16 inches per year annually and warm short summers and long cold winters, typify the area. Permafrost is discontinuous and sporadically present on the steeper north and east facing slopes and low marshy-forested areas. The exploration season on our claims is limited to mid- June through late September. During these months the ground is typically free of snow cover with long daylight hours (up to 22 hours per day). Property Geology\nThe Portage Claims are situated in the southern Dawson and northern Stewart map areas, southwest of the Mesozoic Tintina fault. Metamorphosed rocks of Paleozoic Yukon Tanana Terrain (âYTTâ) mainly underlie the Portage Claims. YTT consists of several units including massive and sheared ultramafic unit, quartz-muscovite (chlorite) schist of Klondike Schist, mainly metasedimentary rocks of the Nasina Series, and coarse grained metaintrusive quartzofeldspathic rocks of the Pelly Gneiss. Several generations of Mesozoic and Tertiary intrusive rocks intruded the YTT rocks. The immediate area of the property is underlain by mainly gray to black graphitic quartzite with abundant fine- grained pyrite and green quartz muscovite (-biotite) schist of Nasina Series. These units are intruded and overlain by Early Tertiary massive quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusions; felsic brecciated lithic tuffs and felsic volcanic breccias. White to cream banded quartz carbonate veins also cut this unit."

Mineralization consists of gold-bearing massive and stockwork quartz-iron replacements associated with an intrusive dike in phyllites. The quartz replacements can be traced intermittently over a length of eight kilometers and a width of up to one kilometer. Mineralization is also associated with regional faulting along the hinge of an anticline. A limited amount of surface work was conducted in 2009. Based upon this work, additional surface sampling is planned for 2010 to determine if the property warrants drilling in 2011. 5. Paria Cruz\nThe Paria Cruz property consists of three concessions totaling 3,000 hectares staked in the first half of 2008. We capitalized $10,000 in mineral property payments for initial acquisition costs during the second quarter of 2008. No payments are due to third parties so the only holding costs for the mineral rights are annual payments of three dollars per hectare to the Peruvian government during the first six years that the claims are held.",
      "Upon reaching an agreement with the community, additional surface work to further define drill targets is planned, followed by an initial ten-hole, 1,200 meter drilling program that is scheduled for the second half of 2010, pending receipt of drilling permits. 2. Cajatambo\nThe Cajatambo property consists of eleven concessions totaling 10,500 hectares that was acquired in 2008 and 2009. No payments are due to third parties so the only holding costs for the mineral rights are annual payments of three dollars per hectare to the Peruvian government during the first six years that the claims are held. Solitario currently has land agreements with the local communities that allows us to conduct exploration activities, including drilling. The geology of the property consists of Tertiary volcanic and intrusive rocks that have been significantly altered by silicification, quartz-alunite and argillic alteration. The alteration system can be intermittently traced over an area ten kilometers long by two-three kilometers wide. There are high-sulfidation type mineralized occurrences and shallow hypabyssal porphyry related systems that are geologically similar in character to many of the large gold deposits situated throughout the Cordillera of Peru. In 2008 we drilled 7 reverse circulation exploration holes totaling 892 meters. Assay results for all 7 holes were generally low with the best drill hole intercept, hole CJ-002, intersecting 8 meters of 1.32 grams per tonne (\"gpt\") gold. In 2009 we conducted further follow-up on several isolated gold anomalies located approximately nine kilometers south of the previously drilled areas. This follow-up work resulted in defining a very large area of significant gold and silver mineralization in rocks and soils, where rock exposure is poor. Nearly a thousand rock and soil samples were collected to define the 3.5 by 1.5 kilometer zone of gold-silver mineralization. Seventeen line kilometers of induced polarization geophysical survey was conducted in late-2009 and indicates gold-silver mineralization occurs along the margin of a strong chargeability anomaly.",
      "Bonanza-grade channel samples from flooded historic galleries have been discovered which indicate good continuity, width, and high gold grades. Ouro Mil Property: This property is located approximately 290 km due south of the city of Itaituba in southern Para region of Brazil. This property comprises of 82 mineral concessions for a total area of 13,444 hectares and includes 71 prospector leases and 3 overlying exploration leases. Geochemical and geophysical data has highlighted the potential for a large volume of low grade Alkaline or Calc-Alkaline Porhyritic Cu-Au deposits or possibly an IOCG (Iron Oxide Copper Gold) type deposit. In September 2010, Dourave established a joint venture option with Brazilian Gold Corp. whereby the Company could earn a 70% interest in this property for an investment of up to US$550,000 of staged cash payments and work expenditure commitments of up to US$5 million over a four year period. A drill program is scheduled to commence in mid-2011. The figure below shows the Ouro Mil magnetic analytical signal and geochemical results:\nPositive results returned from the new, enlarged geochemical grid have confirmed the presence of a large 1.5km x 1km gold anomaly surrounded by multiple coincident Cu, Pb, Zn, Co, Ag, and U anomalies. A drill program is scheduled at Our Mil for mid-2011. Pontal do Paranaita Property: This property is located close to the municipality of Paranaita, near Alta Floresta, a region that has historically produced millions of ounces of gold from alluvial workings to the north of the State of Mato Grosso in Brazil. Dourave and Chapleau Exploracao Mineral Ltd. have conducted exploration geology on this property totalling over 873 hectares. Preliminary geochemical results and geological mapping obtained by the Company is encouraging with the potential for a large volume of gold deposits. Based on the geochemical results and geological mapping completed to-date, 10 zones of hydrothermal alteration were defined with gold mineralization that measured approximately 2,250 meters in length.",
      "These concessions represent approximately 17% of the Huizopa property. These payments were made ahead of schedule on February 28, 2007 when the Company issued 1,000,000 shares and paid $2.55 million in settlement of these contractual land payments and certain other claims on its Huizopa properties. The geology is characterized by a series of parallel, low sulfidation gold-silver, quartz veins hosted by Tertiary-age volcanic rocks. Silver to gold ratios in the veins and from the material on historic mine dumps indicate the Huizopa area hosts an extensive gold-bearing hydrothermal system. Two major parallel quartz vein systems with north trending structures contain many single vein outcrops to 10 meters thick suggesting a series of stacked veins. Strike lengths are over 2.0 km on the property with untested down dip potential. The stratigraphy of the Huizopa area has two sections of relatively mafic lava flows with intercalated volcanic clastics. The dominant strike azimuths of faults are 340Âº and 160Âº with dips ranging from vertical to 33Âº. Most of these structures, including the major faults with associated thick gouge or breccia zones, dip eastward. These east dipping faults are the faults associated with quartz veins, brecciation, and mineralization. Initial favorable geochemical sampling and field studies by the Previous Owner in December 2003 were confirmed by us when we reviewed the data and conducted a field evaluation in 2004. We established an extensive remote field camp at the project and refurbished an existing airstrip. The camp is supplied by fixed wing aircraft and helicopter. Mapping of the mining concession began in June 2004 and have been ongoing through 2007. The results were compiled and transferred to new topography maps and air photos as well as the Mexican governmentâs Chabacan topographical sheet which has been enlarged from 1:50,000 scale to 1:10,000. Geologic mapping suggests that the faults that host gold-silver mineralization may be more numerous and more continuous than earlier field work indicated."

Trenching to date has intermittently traced an approximately 150 m to 200 m wide, NE-trending deformation zone over an approximately 1.4 km strike length. This structural corridor is characterized by several sub parallel, shear hosted, gold-bearing quartz vein zones ranging from less than 1 m to approximately 24 m in trench length; with individual quartz veins ranging from less than 1 cm to 5.5 m in trench length. A granitoid body exhibiting widespread, low grade gold mineralization (0.43 ppm gold over 62 m) exposed within trench TMU005 at the southwestern extremity of the Ankaase Gold Trend is also of significant exploration interest. Ankaase Trend 2009-2010 Trenching Program\nThe 2009-2010 trenching program encompassed 12 hand dug trenches, ranging from 30 m to 68 m in length and from 1.2 m to 3.5 m in depth, and totaling 546.0 linear meters. This trenching program commenced on December 1, 2009 and was completed on February 20, 2010.",

Note that all the weighted average grade intervals represent trench lengths and are not necessarily indicative of the true widths of the mineralization. Calculation of true widths within trenches can be difficult, as not all geological features are properly exposed. In addition, these mineralized intervals currently represent isolated features for which no strike extension can be measured due to the relatively long distances between the trenches; additional infill soil sampling and trenching is required to define the actual strike length of the mineralization. At Apapam, gold mineralization has been found to occur in several different geological features, including steeply and flat - lying quartz veins and alteration haloes proximate to the quartz veining."

Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments\nAcquisitions of Existing Communities. We have acquired seven communities containing 1,960 apartment homes since January 1, 2000 for an acquisition price of approximately $252,400,000. Six of the communities were acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated party. Sales of Existing Communities. We seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:\no apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth; o reduce operating expenses; and o leverage management talent. To achieve this increased concentration, we are selling assets in certain submarkets and intend to redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities currently under construction or reconstruction.

Land Acquisitions and Leases for New Developments. We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2000, we acquired the following land parcels for future development:\n(1) Total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Development Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",

Nonetheless, because of increases in prevailing market rents we believe that, in the aggregate, we will still achieve our targeted projected yield (i.e., return on invested capital) for those communities experiencing costs in excess of the original budget. We believe that we could experience similar increases in construction costs and market rents with respect to other development communities resulting in total construction costs that exceed original budgets. Likewise, costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. We cannot assure that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or repositioned communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs.

The following illustrations depict the acreage position of our Exploration and Production segment and the midstream assets of our Midstream segment, each as of December 31, 2015. The majority of our properties are located on or under private properties owned in fee, held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired without warranty of underlying land titles. Exploration and Production Segment Properties\nAll of the current and planned operations of our Exploration and Production segment are located in what we believe to be the cores of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin. In addition, we have operations in the Upper Devonian Shale and Utica Shale on our Pennsylvania acreage. The properties of our Exploration and Production segment consist of interests in developed and undeveloped leases that entitle us to drill for and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, royalty and overriding royalty interests.

      "In most cases, we incur the expense of retaining lawyers to verify the rightful owners of the oil and gas interests prior to payment of such lease bonus to the lessor. There is no certainty, however, that a lessor has valid title to its leaseâs oil and gas interests. In those cases, such leases are generally voided and payment is not remitted to the lessor. As such, title failures may result in fewer net acres to us. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include:\nâ¢\ncustomary royalty interests;\nâ¢\nliens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes;\nâ¢\nobligations or duties under applicable laws;\nâ¢\ndevelopment obligations under natural gas leases; or\nâ¢\nnet profits interests. Midstream Segment Properties\nThe gathering, compression and fresh water distribution systems of our Midstream segment are located in what we believe to be the core of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin.

      "Products are shipped via bulk rail, bulk truck, via IBCs and bags. Over the last five years, we have invested in projects to increase frac sand capacity at the Oregon facility as well as its reserve base. The Oregon facility derives its silica sand ore from the St. Peter Sandstone. The silica sand product contains a minimum silica content of 99% and meets API standards for proppant applications. The sandstone section is mined in two benches to optimize blending capabilities to support the production of glass and frac sand products. Occurrences of iron oxide in the deposit tend to be higher in the lower mining bench. The primary key quality parameters controlling mine sequence development are: (i) the percentage of iron oxide, aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide to support glass grade product production; and (ii) the percentage of retained product 140 mesh sand fraction. Ottawa, Minnesota. We acquired our Ottawa location in 1971 from Gopher State Silica and in 1978 completed brownfield construction of its current Ottawa facility. The facility is located in Le Sueur, Le Sueur County, Minnesota, approximately 65 miles southwest of Minneapolis. It consists of approximately 2,650 acres of owned real property and is accessible by using major highways, including U.S. Interstate 169. The facility uses natural gas and electricity to process sand. Processed material is shipped via rail using the Union Pacific railroad utilizing the siteâs 10,000 linear feet of rail. Currently, annual capacity is approximately 800,000 tons and the average utilization rate over the past three years was 71%. The total net book value of the Ottawa facilityâs real property and fixed assets was $54.7 million at December 31, 2018. The sand reserve mined from the open-pit mine is from the Jordan Sandstone. The mine has overburden ranging from 10 to 100 feet that needs to be removed to access the silica sand reserves. The facility is a load and carry operation with wheel loaders feeding conveyors to the in-pit crushing system.",
      "In response, the Company is pursuing alternate sources in Canada and the Southern U.S. to increase volumes. The transportation market for lumber is affected by housing starts and remodeling activity, while the transportation market for paper products is driven by end-user demand for packaging and newsprint. Metals and Ores. Metals and ores traffic includes both ferrous and non- ferrous metals and is concentrated on the steel mills of the west and shipments from copper mines and smelters in the southwest. These markets are sensitive to demand for construction and pipeline projects along with demand for industrial production and consumer goods with substantial metals components. The markets also are affected by commodity prices in international markets and subject to the substitution of imported metals. Other. The traffic generated by the business development groups discussed above amounted to approximately 88.9% of the Company's gross freight revenues for 1994. Other commodity and product groups included in the Company's traffic mix include automobiles, automotive parts, construction materials, non-metallic minerals and government traffic.\nMexico. The Company's Mexico Group, headquartered in Houston, serves as a marketing and service link between the Company's business development groups and markets in Mexico. The Company maintains a working relationship with FNM. During 1994, approximately 176,000 carloads, or 7.7% of the Company's total carloads, were from traffic with Mexico. FNM and the Company are working on establishing through rates for carload shipments of selected commodities through all six of the gateways to Mexico served by the Company. The Company also provides intermodal container service linking the ICTF and Mexico City and has developed joint marketing arrangements with Mexican trucking companies establishing single through rates on a truck-rail-truck delivery system.

Miles of first main track include operating rights on 2,578 miles of track owned by other railroads.",
      "In August 2010, we expanded this facilityâs processing capabilities to include the processing of frac sand. These production techniques allow the Pacific facility to meet a wide variety of focused specifications on product composition from customers. As such, the Pacific facility services multiple end markets, such as glass, foundry, fillers and extenders and oil and gas proppants. Once the product is appropriately processed, it is packaged in bulk and shipped either by rail directly by Union Pacific Corporation and through open switching on the same line by BNSF Railway Company or by truck. Berkeley Springs, West Virginia\nOur surface mines at the Berkeley Springs facility use fuel oil and electricity to produce whole grain, ground and fine ground silica and Florisil through hard rock mining. The reserves are part of the Oriskany Sandstone Formation along the Warm Springs Ridge in eastern West Virginia. The facility is located approximately 100 miles northwest of Baltimore and is accessible by major highways including U.S. Interstate 70. We acquired the Berkeley Springs facility in 1987 by merger with the Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corporation, which had historically used the property to produce whole grain silica for customers in industrial and specialty products end markets. Since acquiring the facility we have renovated and upgraded its production capabilities to enable it to produce multiple products through various processing methods, including primary, secondary and tertiary crushing, grinding, flotation, de-watering, fluid bed drying, mechanical screening and rotary drying processing. These production techniques allow the Berkeley Springs facility to meet a wide variety of focused specifications from customers producing specialty epoxies, resins and polymers, geothermal energy equipment and fiberglass. As such, the Berkeley Springs facility services multiple end markets, such as glass, building products, foundry, chemicals and fillers and extenders.

      "Based on the factors described above, Kronos expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for TiO2 during the next three to five years. However, no assurance can be given that future increases in the TiO2 industry production capacity and future average annual demand growth rates for TiO2 will conform to Kronos' expectations. If actual developments differ from Kronos' expectations, Kronos and the TiO2 industry's performances could be unfavorably affected. Research and development. Kronos' expenditures for research and development process technology and quality assurance activities were approximately $6 million in 2002, $7 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2004. Research and development activities are conducted principally at the Leverkusen, Germany facility. Such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening Kronos' competitive position by developing new pigment applications. Kronos continually seeks to improve the quality of its grades, and has been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of customers and increase product life cycle. Over the last five years, ten new grades have been added for plastics, coatings, fiber and paper laminate applications. Patents and trademarks. Patents held for products and production processes are important to Kronos and its continuing business activities. Kronos seeks patent protection for its technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe, and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties. Kronos' existing patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing, and have remaining terms ranging from one to 19 years. Kronos seeks to protect its intellectual property rights, including its patent rights, and from time to time Kronos is engaged in disputes relating to the protection and use of intellectual property relating to its products."

      "As mentioned previously, the entombment of the precious metals in the organic carbon and clays at the Columbus Project can cause problems of detection by many methods of analysis. In January 2010, the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) reported they found no economically significant amounts of gold and silver in five surface samples from the Columbus Salt Marsh using a variety of assay methods. These results are consistent with the values initially found by our independent consultants using similar methods. However, further research and testing led to the development of a caustic fusion protocol, a thiosulphate leach process and, more recently, a gravity concentrating circuit that has extracted economically significant values of gold and silver as âmetal-in-hand,â from samples where conventional fire assay, aqua regia leach and cyanide leach of head ore extracted very low values. The best assay of any geological sample is by quantifying the extracted metal. That is why we and our consultants rely only on extracted gold and silver as âmetal-in-handâ for reporting assay results. The caustic fusion and thiosulphate leach provide âmetal-in-handâ on head ore as do caustic fusion, thiosulphate leach and cyanide leach on gravity concentrates. Using these assay methods, together with the quality assurances and quality controls of the drill program, we and our consultants are confident of the results that we have reported from head ore and concentrate samples. MINING AND RECOVERY METHODOLOGY\nThe Company currently has a production permit for the Columbus Project. The production permit allows for the extraction of precious metals and the production of calcium carbonate on the 378 acre site (320 acre mine site and 58-acre mill site) at a mine rate of up to 792,000 tons per year. During the period from 2008-2011 the Company developed a dredge mine, constructed a pilot plant and began operations to develop and prove the extractive metallurgy for the Columbus Project. Initial metallurgical testing was primarily focused on extracting gold and silver from the clay material.",
      "Thiosulphate leaching is a relatively new, environmentally friendly, hydrometallurgical method for extracting gold and silver from ores. Again, independent work has shown that thiosulphate leaching, followed by resin or carbon extraction, has been very effective in bench and pilot scale tests for the extraction of gold and silver, as âmetalin-handâ, at the Columbus Project. Aqua regia and cyanide leaching tests proved ineffective and resulted in extremely low gold and silver extraction. It is the thiosulphate leach system that is currently being tested onsite to determine the feasibility of leaching both the clay and sand deposits. As mentioned previously, the entombment of the precious metals in the organic carbon and clays at the Columbus Project can cause problems of detection by many methods of analysis.

These results are consistent with the values initially found by our independent consultants using similar methods. However, further research and testing led to the development of a caustic fusion protocol, a thiosulphate leach process and, more recently, a standard fire assay method on gravity concentrates that has extracted economically significant values of gold and silver as âmetal-in-hand,â from samples where conventional fire assay, aqua regia leach and cyanide leach of head ore extracted very low values.

      "Barrick Gold Corporationâs Goldstrike mine in Nevada uses a thiosulfate leaching circuit that went into commercial production in 2015. Our work showed that thiosulphate leaching of head ore concentrates, followed by resin extraction, was very effective in bench and pilot scale tests conducted off site for the extraction of gold and silver, as âmetal-in-handâ from materials extracted from the Columbus Project. Aqua regia and cyanide leaching tests of head ore and aqua regia leaching of concentrates had previously proved ineffective and resulted in extremely low gold and silver extraction. However, both thiosulphate and cyanide leaching of concentrates have extracted commercial values on samples extracted from the Columbus Project. It is the thiosulphate leach system that was installed at the on-site pilot plant in 2013 to determine the feasibility of leaching both the sand and clay deposits. To ensure the reliability of our results, unless specifically stated otherwise, we have instituted rigorous QA/QC protocols, including blind random sampling, and the inclusion of blanks, standards and duplicates. To further ensure reliability, we measure only the actual amount of gold and silver physically extracted from our test samples when reporting assay results. Caustic fusion provides âmetal-in-handâ on head ore and concentrates as do thiosulphate leach and cyanide leach on gravity concentrates. Using these assay methods, together with the quality assurances and quality controls of the drill program, we and our consultants are confident of the previous results that we have reported from head ore and concentrate samples. Fire assaying is the most common pyrometallurgical method used for extracting gold and silver from rock. Fire assaying relies on the use of standardized chemical fluxes to reduce the melting point of the minerals entombing the gold and silver so that they can be liberated and collected in a lead âbuttonâ and examined. Although this process works well for extracting gold entombed in sulfides (e.g. pyrite) and silica, such as that found in Carlin-type gold deposits, the chemical fluxes used in fire assaying methods are ineffective at liberating the gold and silver from refractory minerals (organics and silicates (Fe-Mg-Al-Si-Ox)) as are found at the Columbus Project.",
      "These results are consistent with the values initially found by our independent consultants using similar methods.

Pilot and Bench Scale Leach Test Results In the first quarter of 2009, AuRIC conducted a pilot scale leach test on 1,738 pounds of material extracted from our Permitted Mine Area by Arrakis under chain of custody protocols. No mineral processing operations, such as crushing, grinding, drying or screening, were performed on the sample prior to leaching. The material was analyzed using a caustic fusion technique and reported head grades of 0.055 ounces per ton (opt) gold (Au) and 0.520 opt silver (Ag). The material was then leached, resulting in the extraction of 0.047 opt Au and 0.464 opt Ag into solution. The precious metals were subsequently collected on resins and processed to produce Au and Ag bullion, for a net extraction of 0.038 opt Au and 0.385 opt Ag. This represents leach extraction of 86.2% of Au into solution and 69.1% of Au recovered as metal. This also represents leach extraction of 89.2% of Ag into solution and 74% of Ag recovered as metal. The overall extraction was 0.043 opt AuE. Upon completion of the test, the precious metal beads were delivered to us. In the second quarter of 2009, AuRIC conducted bench scale leach tests on composite drill samples taken from Zone B Central by McEwen."

      "Between 1970 and 1990, various consortia conducted various exploration activities. Viti Copper Ltd. managed the project during the prefeasibility stage. Over 164,000 feet of drilling was completed and feasibility studies indicated material grading 0.43% copper for the two main Waisoi deposits. From 1986 to 1989, Anglo Pacific Namosi Ltd. and Western Mining Corporation carried out exploration programs aimed at assessing the gold potential at the major prospects and in the vein systems peripheral to the porphyry copper deposits. In 1991, renewed investigations were begun by Placer and included 39 drill holes at Waisoi and 8 holes at Wainabama. Placer conducted a detailed economic study of the Waisoi deposit and concluded that the project required further geological exploration success to achieve viability. In 1998, Royal Oak drilled one hole to a depth of 180 meters on the Wainabama deposit. Sampling, prospecting and mapping were also carried out in the Waivaka Corridor. The Company undertook a 1,000-sample hydrocarbon soil gas\nsurvey covering the northern third of the island of Viti Levu to find a potential source of power that is critical to the development of the Namosi project. The survey resulted in the discovery of seven anomalies. GEOLOGY\nThe major porphyry copper prospects are at Waisoi, Wainabama, Waivaka Corridor and Wainadoi, and there are a number of polymetallic vein and skarn systems around the periphery. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with high level intrusion of Wainamala tuffs and Namosi andesites. The main controls on porphyry intrusions are northeast and north northwest trending faults related to regional tectonics. High copper and gold values occur in the cupola region of the stocks and around brecciated, faulted and stockworked haloes. ORE RESERVES The Company has not included any portion of the Namosi property in mineable (proven and probable) reserves. The most significant part of the Namosi property is the Waisoi deposit. As of December 31, 1998 the Company estimated the mineral inventory on the Waisoi deposit to be approximately 9.1 billion pounds of copper and 4.0 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 1.0 billion tons at a grade of 0.430% copper and 0.004 opt of gold.",
      "Ore reserves do not include allowances for losses in milling. INTERNATIONAL DIVISION NAMOSI PROJECT\nBACKGROUND\nThe Namosi property comprises 178,000 acres and is located 30 km northwest of Suva, the capital of Fiji. In April 1997, the Company received consent from the Fijian government for the transfer of Namosi mining tenements SPL 1352 and SPL 1367 from Placer Pacific Namosi Ltd (\"Placer\"). Following this consent, the Company, through its wholly- owned subsidiary, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc., received certification from the Registrar of Companies to carry out business as a foreign company in Fiji. OWNERSHIP\nApproval of the Namosi licenses was granted in August 1997 and as a result, Arctic Precious Metals, Inc. was granted the right to carry out exploration and related activities on the properties throughout 1998. MINING AND MILLING\nA detailed search for porphyry copper deposits began in 1968 when Australian Anglo American (Fiji) Pty Ltd. acquired the property. Between 1970 and 1990, various consortia conducted various exploration activities. Viti Copper Ltd. managed the project during the prefeasibility stage. Over 164,000 feet of drilling was completed and feasibility studies indicated material grading at 0.43% copper for the two main Waisoi deposits.

      "Duval Corporation was the first company to test the Elder Creek porphyry system for porphyry copper mineralization. In 1965 they drilled 3 core holes. From 1966 to 1969, Rocky Mountain Energy, the minerals group of the\nUnion Pacific Railroad Co., completed exploration on the property -and in 1968 they drilled 8 deep core holes that encountered sub-economic copper-molybdenum values. Additional exploration in the 1960âs focused on geophysical targets and included multiple drill holes in and around S36, T33N, R43E. The drill holes discovered low-grade copper mineralization under pediment gravels where located within the north-northeastern, outer fringe of an annular magnetic anomaly that surrounds the porphyry system core. Also, in the 1960âs, Valmy Copper Corporation drilled five shallow holes that identified low-grade copper oxide mineralization from surface to 190- 330 feet deep along the inner edge of the annular magnetic anomaly. The reported copper grades were considered to be too low to warrant further exploration. Low-level gold values within and around the Elder Creek stock led to fairly extensive drilling by several major companies in the 1980âs and 90âs. V. E. K. Associates held the property in 1984 and brought in Cordex (1987) to drill 3 holes, BRM Gold (1991) drilled 4 holes, and Battle Mountain Gold (1992) completed 3 holes. Battle Mountain Gold staked most of the Elder Creek stock and completed about 40 drill holes, reportedly encountering substantial low-level gold but no orebody. Western Mining Co. (1994-95) drilled 11 holes in the Elder Creek property area and 8 holes on adjacent ground. The deepest hole went to a depth of about 1,500 feet. Eleven of these holes contained thirty, 10-foot intervals that exceeded 100 ppb gold (Theodore et al., 2000, p.185). During 1995, a Santa Fe-Battle Mountain Gold joint venture drilled 7 holes north of the property, one on the north boundary of the Mote claims. The Mote claims were located by NLRC in 1999. Geology of the Elder Creek Area\nIn the western part of the Elder Creek area, the Dewitt Thrust fault places Ordovician Valmy Formation cherts and shales on top of Cambrian Harmony Formation quartz- and feldspathic-sandstones and shales, which are locally calcareous."

Global Climate Change: In December 1997, delegates from 167 nations, including the United States, agreed to a treaty, known as the \"Kyoto Protocol,\" establishing legally-binding emission reductions for gases suspected of causing climate change. If the U.S. becomes a party to the treaty it will be bound to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane and nitrous oxides by 7% below 1990 levels and emissions of hydrofluorcarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride 7% below 1995 levels in the years 2008-2012. The Protocol was available for signature from March 16, 1998 to March 15, 1999 and requires ratification by at least 55 nations that account for at least 55% of developed countries' 1990 emissions of CO(2) to enter into force. Although the United States has agreed to the treaty and signed it on November 12, 1998, President Clinton has indicated that he will not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it contains requirements for \"meaningful participation by key developing countries\" and the rules, procedures, methodology and guidelines of the treaty's market-based policy instruments, joint implementation programs and compliance enforcement provisions have been negotiated. At the Fourth Conference of the Parties, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, the parties agreed to a work plan to complete negotiations on outstanding issues with a view toward approving them at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to be held in November 2000. Since the AEP System is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by the imposition of limitations on CO(2) emissions if compliance costs cannot be fully recovered from customers. In addition, any such severe program to reduce CO(2) emissions could impose substantial costs on industry and society and erode the economic base that AEP's operations serve.",
      "The Safe Drinking Water Act, or âSDWAâ, and analogous state laws impose requirements relating to underground injection activities.

Air emissions . The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, EPA and certain states have developed and continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change became effective in February 2005. Under the Protocol, participating nations are required to implement programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases that are suspected of contributing to global warming. The United States is not currently a participant in the Protocol, and Congress has not acted upon recent proposed legislation directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there has been support in various regions of the country for legislation that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and some states have already adopted legislation addressing greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, primarily power plants.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the âEPAâ) issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect January 1, 2010, and required reporting by regulated facilities by September 30, 2011 and annually thereafter. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule that sets forth reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry and requires persons that hold state drilling permits that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to report annually carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from certain sources. Under a regulatory extension, the deadline for the petroleum and natural gas industry sources to report their greenhouse gas emissions was changed to September 28, 2012. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an âEndangerment Findingâ under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of future generations. The EPA indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that established new source performance standards for volatile organic compounds (âVOC(s)â) and sulfur dioxide, an air toxics standard for major sources of oil and natural gas production, and an air toxics standard for major sources of natural gas transmission and storage. Beginning January 1, 2015, all hydraulically fractured or refractured natural gas wells had to be completed using so called âgreen completionâ technology, which significantly reduces VOC emissions. Limiting emissions of VOCs will have the co-benefit of also limiting methane, a greenhouse gas. These regulations apply to natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, and to storage tanks and other equipment.",

This basin covers an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers, contains 129 fields, and has produced over 1.5 billion barrels of oil to date (source: IHS Inc., 2010). Production from this basin is mainly light oil ranging between 35 and 40 API. These four blocks have a total area of 27,075 gross acres. Gran Tierra is awaiting regulatory approval from Brazilâs ANP to recognize Gran Tierra as the operator of these exploration blocks. All of our blocks in Brazil are subject to an 11% royalty, which consists of a 10% crown royalty and a 1% landowner royalty which applies to onshore blocks. All four blocks are in phase one of the contracts which expire March 12, 2011. An application for a six month extension has been made for Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, and REC-T-224. The first phase for each of Blocks REC-T-129 and REC-T-142 requires the drilling of an exploratory well and, for Block REC-T-224,14 requires the acquisition of 35 square kilometers of 3D seismic. There is no remaining phase one commitment for Block REC-T-155. In the third and fourth quarters of 2010, 93 square kilometers of 3D seismic was acquired over Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142 and REC-T-155. An additional 35 square kilometers of 3D seismic survey is planned for the first quarter of 2011 for Block REC-T-224. The 1-ALV-2-BA well on Block REC T-155 is presently producing approximately 500 BOPD gross (350 BOPD net after royalties). We plan to dual complete this well in the first quarter of 2011 and plan to drill two appraisal wells to further develop this discovery. In 2011, we plan to drill four exploration wells on Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142 and REC-T-155. The drilling of these wells meets or exceeds each blocksâ phase one commitments. Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, and REC-T-224 will require an additional exploration well to satisfy the phase two commitments and these are planned for 2012.",
      "It is an exploration block with no production history. The contractâs exploration period expired in December 2010 however we received a 90 day extension to March 29, 2011. We are using the extension to allow for the interpretation of the 202 square kilometers of 3D seismic acquired in 2010 and determine whether to proceed into the next phase of the contract. We have no other outstanding commitments related to the block contract. Oil and Gas Properties - Peru\nWe entered Peru in 2006 through the award by the government of Peru of two frontier exploration blocks, Block 122 and Block 128, in the Maranon Basin. In September 2010, we acquired a 20% non-operated working interest in three blocks in the Maranon Basin. These three blocks, Block 123, Block 124, and Block 129 are adjacent to Block 122 and Block 128. In December 2010, we further increased our acreage position in the Maranon Basin in Peru by acquiring a 60% working interest in Block 95. The acquisition in 2010 of these four blocks is subject to approval by the Government of Peru. There is a 5-20%, sliding scale, royalty rate on the lands, dependent on production levels. Production less than 5,000 barrels of oil per day is assessed a royalty of 5%, for production between 5,000 and 100,000 barrels of oil per day there is a linear sliding scale between 5% and 20%. Production over 100,000 barrels per day has a royalty of 20%. This royalty structure applies to all 6 blocks in Peru that we have an interest in. Block 122 and Block 128\nWe were awarded two exploration blocks in Peru in the last quarter of 2006 under a license contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. Block 122 covers 1,217,651 gross acres and Block 128 covers 2,218,389 gross acres. In February 2011, we relinquished 20%, or 443,678 gross acres in Block 128. The blocks are located in the eastern flank of the Maranon Basin in northern Peru, on the crest of the Iquitos Arch. There is a financial commitment of $3.5 million over the seven years for each block which includes technical studies, seismic acquisition and the drilling of exploration wells.",
      "Triton expects to test the extension of the Chiapas fold belt trend into Guatemala. Ecuador\nThrough the Company's subsidiary, Triton Ecuador, Inc. LLC (\"Triton Ecuador\"), the Company holds an interest in Block 19 located in the Ecuadorian foothills in the Oriente Basin. During 1995, Triton farmed out a 30% interest in the area to Vintage Petroleum Ecuador, Inc. and a 15% interest to Ranger Oil Limited, in each case subject to government approval. The partners' work program commitments for Block 19 consist of the acquisition of 400 kilometers of new seismic data and the drilling of two exploratory wells during a four-year exploration period. An environmental impact study was completed in 1995 and a 420 kilometer (263 mile)-seismic acquisition program is expected to be completed in 1996. Exploratory drilling is planned to begin in 1997. China\nThe Company's subsidiary, Triton China, Inc. LLC (\"Triton China\"), signed a production sharing contract with the China National Offshore Oil Company in February 1995 giving the Company the right to explore and develop Contract Area 16/22 located approximately 175 kilometers (110 miles) offshore from Hong Kong in water depths ranging from 300 to 650 feet. The 791,000-acre block is in the Huizhou Sub-basin of the Pearl River Mouth Basin. The block has a primary three year exploration term with a commitment of reprocessing 500 kilometers (310 miles) of existing seismic and the drilling of an exploratory well for a total expenditure of not less than $7.5 million. In April 1995, the Company was awarded the adjacent 1.9 million acre block, Contract Area 16/01, as a Joint Study Area. Seismic reprocessing on both blocks, of an aggregate of approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), was completed in 1995 and the Company expects to drill its first exploratory well in Contract Area 16/22 in 1996.

      "Item 2 and Note 4 to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Impact of Year 2000 - ------------------- The General Partner and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, the General Partner's ultimate parent (together, John Hancock) along with the Partnership, have developed a plan to modify or replace significant portions of the Partnership's computer information and automated technologies so that its systems will function properly with respect to the dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. The Partnership presently believes that with modifications to existing systems and conversions to new technologies, the year 2000 will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems. However, if certain modifications and conversions are not made, or are not completed timely, the year 2000 issue could have an adverse impact on the operations of the Partnership. John Hancock as early as 1994 had begun assessing, modifying and converting the software related to its significant systems and has initiated formal communications with its significant business partners and customers to determine the extent to which John Hancock's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues. While John Hancock is developing alternative third party processing arrangements as it deems appropriate, there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Partnership's systems rely will be converted timely or will not have an adverse effect on the Partnership's systems. The Partnership expects the project to be substantially complete by early 1999. This completion target was derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, including availability of certain resources and other factors. However, there can be no guarantee that this completion target will be achieved. Forward-looking Statements - -------------------------- In addition to historical information, certain statements contained herein contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
      "Some of the older computer programs utilized by PSI were written without regard for Year 2000 issues and could cause a system failure or miscalculations with possible disruption of operations. Each of these computer programs and systems has been evaluated to be upgraded or replaced as part of PSI's Year 2000 project. The cost of the Year 2000 project will be allocated to all entities that use the PSI computer systems. The cost of the Year 2000 project which is expected to be allocated to the Partnership is approximately $96,000. The cost of new software will be capitalized and the cost of maintenance to existing systems will be expensed as incurred. The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1999 which is prior to any anticipated impact on operating systems. PSI believes that with modifications to existing software and, in some instances, the conversion to new software, the Year 2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems. However, if such modifications are not made, or are not completed timely, the Year 2000 issue could have a material impact on the operations of the Partnership. The costs of the project and the date on which PSI believes it will complete the Year 2000 modifications are based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events. There can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.\nITEM 2. Properties. ----------- The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1997 about properties owned by the Partnership. Thirty of these properties were acquired jointly with PSI and were contributed to a general partnership comprised of the Partnership and PSI. The weighted average occupancy level for the mini-warehouse facilities was 91% in 1997 compared to 90% in 1996. The monthly average realized rent per square foot for the mini-warehouse facilities was $.64 in 1997 compared to $.62 in 1996. Substantially all of the Partnership's facilities were acquired prior to the time that it was customary to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions.",
      "We believe that such modification and replacements are not significant, and should such modification and replacements be delayed there would be no material impact on our operations. We are approximately 85% complete with the assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the Year 2000. To date, cost estimates for upgrades for those systems not in compliance total approximately $200,000. After the assessment phase is completed, we will have to purchase, install and test the upgrades to ensure they meet internal Year 2000 compliance. We expect to complete our internal Year 2000 readiness program in the third quarter of 1999. We are in the process of asking our significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with us (external agents) whether their systems are Year 2000 compliant. To date, we are not aware of any external agent with a Year 2000 Issue that would materially impact our results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. However, we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be Year 2000 ready. The inability of external agents to complete their Year 2000 resolutions to process in a timely fashion could materially impact us. We currently have no contingency plans in place in the event we do not complete all phases of the Year 2000 program. We plan to evaluate the status of completion in second quarter of 1999 and determine whether such a plan is necessary. Pharmaceuticals Risk Factors\nDEPENDENCE ON COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\nWe expect to seek collaborative agreements to develop and commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates. We may not be successful in negotiating or entering into such agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, and any agreement, if entered into, may be unsuccessful. The research and development efforts in our diabetes program and, to a lesser extent, in our other programs, have been dependent upon arrangements with Lipha/Merck and Ono and their funding for research and development efforts thereunder.",
      "We remain subject to risks associated with the Year 2000 readiness problems of third parties, especially providers of products and services that are critical to our ability to conduct our business operations, including other telephone service providers with which our service connects. We are also aware that governmental authorities and third parties in the markets where our subsidiaries and our affiliates operate with whom we may have material business relationships may not be at the same level of awareness, or assessment or remediation of their potential Year 2000 readiness issues as are their United States counterparts. If any of these third parties or we are unable to resolve material Year 2000 readiness issues on a timely or cost-effective basis, there would be an adverse effect on us. 12. NEXTEL INTERNATIONAL'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM CURRENT BELIEFS. A) \"SAFE HARBOR\" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995: A number of the statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not historical or current facts, but deal with potential future circumstances and developments. Those statements are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding expectations generally, and also may materially differ from our actual experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas. We have attempted to identify, in context, some of the factors that we currently believe may cause actual experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area.",
      "The following table reflects the composition of the Company's restructuring reserve, the expenditures applied against it, and the portion of the reserve that was reversed at December 31, 1999:\nYEAR 2000 ISSUES\nAlthough we have not experienced any material problems related to Year 2000 issues, we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues, which may disrupt our operations. Year 2000 computer issues concern the inability of computer systems to accurately calculate, store, or use data after December 31, 1999. These computer issues may cause our computer systems, or those of our business partners, to process financial and operational information incorrectly. We have taken action over the past year to identify and correct these problems. We believe that our internal systems were Year 2000 compliant at December 31, 1999 and, to date, we have not experienced any problems related to Year 2000 issues. It is possible, however, that we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues in the next several months. We cannot assure that our operations have not been, or will not be affected by Year 2000 issues in a manner that has not become apparent to us or that may arise in the future. If our efforts or the efforts of our business partners failed to adequately address Year 2000 issues, we could incur costs to correct affected systems. While our Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve additional costs, we believe that these costs would not have a material impact on our financial results. The Company incurred third-party costs of approximately $50,000 related to Year 2000 issues. EFFECTS OF INFLATION Substantially all of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices."

The Company believes that the Red River \"B\" formation in the Cedar Hills Field is well suited for enhanced secondary recovery using HPAI technology. On four nearby HPAI projects operated by the Company, HPAI technology has increased oil recoveries 200% to 300% over primary recovery with ultimate recoveries reaching up to 40% of the original oil in place."

      "Home office support also involved permanent and contract support. Exploratory drilling includes costs of travel, food and lodging, payments on the drill rig, drill bits, fuel, drilling permits, and maintenance costs of the drill rig and of support vehicles. Also included are the costs of reclamation bonds and reclamation costs of lands disturbed by drilling, as well as the costs of conducting archaeological surveys to identify prehistoric remains of human habitation or human activity. Currently there are no planned costs for the North Pipes Super Project unless commodity prices, specifically for uranium, increase sufficiently to make exploration financially tenable. The Moratorium on acquiring any additional land has also negatively affected the current investment climate for such work. However we have a letter agreement with Mr. Andrew Mueller to option our existing claims North Pipes claims to him for mining using his vertical bore technology. He believes this will make the Pipes exploitable.

      "Mr. Klein supervised all IP and other geophysical surveys over the Pebble for Cominco who sold the Pebble Project to Northern Dynasty. Thus, we believe Mr. Klein has had more experience in the geophysics of the area, which includes over 2,000 square miles, than any other geophysicist. The results were interpreted and sent back to the Alaska headquarters every night. (3) Liberty Star contracted with Geotech Limited of London, Ontario, Canada to run their ZTEM Electro Magnetic (EM) airborne survey equipment over the Big Chunk project. This thoroughly tested system can look down 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) in to the crust of the earth and detect sulfide mineralization associated with porphyry copper-gold systems, as well as other geologic features. This survey was completed in August 2009. The survey covered 315.2 sq. kilometers (121.7 sq. miles) and consisted of north-south lines spaced 250 meters apart on our Big Chunk Super Project mineral claims. In May 2010, Liberty Star received feedback from Geotech Ltd. that its interpretation showed at least 4 to 7 signatures that are consistent with porphyry copper responses. The 2D computer model shows typical low responsive areas, which could correspond to an ore mineral core zones with a surrounding responsive cylinders representing a pyrite halos typical of Porphyry copper systems. For control, Geotech flew a survey the day after completing the Big Chunk survey, over the Pebble mineral deposit. The anomalies on Big Chunk show strong similarities to the Pebble. During the field seasons of 2004 and 2005 Liberty collected approximately eleven thousand geochemical samples. The sampling program was designed by both consulting geochemist, Shea Clark Smith, of MEG Laboratories in the Reno area of Nevada, and Liberty Chief Geologist, James Briscoe. The sampling program was based on many years of geochemical studies and sampling throughout the world by Mr. Smith and his Masterâs Degree thesis on sampling tundra plants and detecting metals in their woody stems reflecting metals at depth."

The stratigraphically lowest rocks within the Red Dog plate belong to the Kayak Shale, which is interbedded with rocks of the Kuna Formation. The Ikalukrok Unit, which hosts the massive sulfide deposits, has been divided into a lower laminated black shale sub-unit and an upper medium- to thick-bedded black chert sub-unit. The Lik property is hosted in the upper part of the Ikalukrok Unit of the Kuna Formation. The host rocks are carbonaceous and siliceous black shale, with subordinate black chert and fine-grained limestone. The massive sulfides are overlain conformably by rocks of the Siksikpuk Formation. The sequence is overridden by allochthonous rocks that form high hills north and west of the deposits. The mineralized sequence is cut by a number of faults, with the Main Break Fault being the most significant disruption. The Main Break Fault drops the northern end of the Lik deposit down about 500 feet and strikes east-west and dips north at about 60o. The Lik deposit is a black shale-hosted stratiform zinc-lead-silver sedimentary-exhalitive (SEDEX) deposit. Mineralization is syngenetic with respect to sediment deposition. The deposit is continuous outside the Lik property onto the adjacent 100%-owned Teck property to the south. The southern continuation of the Lik deposit is referred to as the Su deposit, lying on Teckâs Su property. Within the Lik property, the deposit is divided into two parts by the Main Break Fault. The main part of the deposit within the existing claims is referred to as the Lik South deposit. As presently tested, the Lik South deposit has a surface footprint of about 3,600 feet long and about 2,000 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 650 feet. The Lik South deposit remains open down dip. North of the Main Break Fault, the Lik North deposit has a surface footprint of about 2,300 feet long and about 1,150 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 1,000 feet. The Lik North deposit remains strongly open down dip and to the north. The deposits strike northerly and dip westerly at about 25o to 40o. The mineralization comprises irregular, stratiform lenses. The mineralogy of the sulfides is simple and comprises pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, and galena. Gangue minerals include quartz (as chert), clay minerals, carbonate and barite. Noranda recognized six different ore types in its logging of drill core.

The mineralized sequence is cut by a number of faults. The most significant disruption is the Main Break Fault, which drops the northern end of the Lik deposit down about 500 feet. It is unclear whether there is a change in strike north of the fault, or whether the change is more apparent due to topography. The Main Break Fault strikes east-west and dips north at about 60o. There is another group of steeper faults that tend to strike northerly or northwesterly and which are interpreted as being both normal and reverse with throws of up to 330 feet. The drilling in 2008 appears to demonstrate that several of these faults are non-existent or more minor than previously interpreted. 6. Prior Exploration\nThe Red Dog ore deposit was originally discovered in 1970 by a geologist undertaking mapping in the De Long Mountains area on behalf of the United States Geological Survey. GCO carried out stream geochemical sampling and reconnaissance for color anomalies. Claims were staked in July 1976 to cover a stream geochemical anomaly on Lik Creek. The Lik property was drill tested in the late 1970âs and early 1980âs and sporadically through the early 1990s. Details of these historical drilling campaigns are discussed above under the heading âHistoryâ and below under the heading âDrilling.â",

It is unclear whether there is a change in strike north of the fault, or whether the change is more apparent due to topography. The Main Break Fault strikes east-west and dips north at about 60o. There is another group of steeper faults that tend to strike northerly or northwesterly and which are interpreted as being both normal and reverse with throws of up to 330 feet.\n6. Prior Exploration and the Results of the 2018 Exploration Program\nThe Red Dog ore deposit was originally discovered in 1970 by a geologist undertaking mapping in the De Long Mountains area on behalf of the United States Geological Survey.",
      "Mineralization of both the VMS-like deposits of the Schist belt and the carbonate-hosted deposits of the Cosmos Hills has been dated at 375 to 387 Ma (Selby el al. 2009; McClelland et al. 2006). In addition, the Ambler district is characterized by increasing metamorphic grade north perpendicular to the strike of the east-west trending units. The district shows isoclinal folding in the northern portion and thrust faulting to south (Schmidt 1983). The Devonian to Mississippian age Angayucham basalt and the Triassic to Jurassic age mafic volcanic rocks are in low-angle over thrust contact with various units of the Ambler Schist belt and Bornite Carbonate Sequence along the northern edge of the Ambler Lowlands. Local/Property Geology\nRocks that form the Ambler Sequence consist of a lithologically diverse sequence of lower Paleozoic Devonian age carbonate and siliciclastic strata with interlayered mafic lava flows and sills and felsic tuffs. The clastic strata, derived from terrigenous continental and volcanic sources, were deposited primarily by mass-gravity flow into the sub-wavebase environment of an extending marginal basin. Though the Ambler Sequence is exposed over 110 km of strike length, descriptions and comments herein will refer to an area between the Kogoluktuk River on the east and the Shungnak River on the west where we have focused the majority of our exploration efforts over the last decade. The local base of the Ambler Sequence consists of variably metamorphosed carbonates historically referred to as the Gnurgle Gneiss. We interpret these strata as calc-turbidites, perhaps deposited in a sub-wavebase environment adjacent to a carbonate bank. Calcareous schists overlie the Gnurgle Gneiss and host sporadically distributed mafic sills and pillowed lavas. These fine-grained clastic strata indicate a progressively quieter depositional environment up section, and the presence of pillowed lavas indicates a rifting, basinal environment. Overlying these basal carbonates and pillowed basalts is a section of predominantly fine-grained carbonaceous siliciclastic rocks which host a significant portion of the mineralization in the district including the Arctic Deposit.",
      "Noranda also drilled holes in the Lik South deposit to better define the deposit. Noranda released its interest in the Lik property after a re-organization of its holdings in the United States. From 1985 through June of 2007, when Zazu acquired its interest in the Lik property, only a limited amount of work was conducted at Lik. Zazu completed diamond drilling programs during the 2007, 2008 and 2011 summer field seasons. From 2009 through 2014, Zazu conducted a suite of economic, engineering, environmental and metallurgical studies on the Lik property, culminating with the completion of a PEA in 2014. 5. Geological Setting\nThe regional geology of the Western Brooks Range area is structurally complex. The sedimentary rocks of the area have been significantly disrupted by thrust sheets. The Lik property and the other zinc-lead deposits of the Brooks Range, including Red Dog, are hosted in the Kuna Formation of the Lisburne Group. In the Western Brooks Range, the Lisburne Group includes both deep and shallow water sedimentary facies and local volcanic rocks. The rocks have been extensively disrupted by thrusting. The deep-water facies of the Lisburne Group, the Kuna Formation, are exposed chiefly in the Endicott Mountains. On a district scale, the Lik property is hosted in the Red Dog plate of the Endicott Mountains thrust sheet. The stratigraphically lowest rocks within the Red Dog plate belong to the Kayak Shale. The top of the Kayak Shale is interbedded with rocks of the Kuna Formation. The Ikalukrok Unit has been divided into a lower laminated black shale sub-unit and an upper medium- to thick-bedded black chert sub-unit. The Ikalukrok Unit hosts all of the massive sulfide deposits in the area. Locally, the Lik property is hosted in the upper part of the Ikalukrok Unit of the Kuna Formation. The host rocks are carbonaceous and siliceous black shale, with subordinate black chert and fine-grained limestone. These rocks strike broadly north-south and dip at about 25o to 40o to the west. The massive sulfides are overlain conformably by rocks of the Siksikpuk Formation.",
      "The stratigraphic and structural reinterpretation in the vicinity of the Lik deposit suggests the potential for stacked deposits below the Lik deposit. 7. Mineralization The Lik deposit is a black shale-hosted stratiform zinc-lead-silver sedimentary-exhalitive (SEDEX) deposit. Mineralization is syngenetic with respect to sediment deposition. Silicification occurs within and peripheral to the main mass of sulfides. Major sulfides in decreasing order of abundance are pyrite-marcasite, sphalerite and galena. The ore textures are massive, fragmental, chaotic, and veined; they rarely show typical sedimentary layering. The portion of the ore body near the surface is oxidized. The deposit is continuous outside the Lik property onto the adjacent 100%-owned Teck property to the south. The southern continuation of the Lik deposit is referred to as the Su deposit, lying on Teckâs Su property. Within the Lik property, the deposit is divided into two parts by the Main Break Fault. The main part of the deposit within the existing claims is referred to as the Lik South deposit. As presently tested, the Lik South deposit has a surface footprint of about 3,600 feet long and about 2,000 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 650 feet. The Lik South deposit remains open down dip. North of the Main Break Fault, the Lik North deposit has a surface footprint of about 2,300 feet long and about 1,150 feet wide. It has been tested down dip to a depth of about 1,000 feet. The Lik North deposit remains strongly open down dip and to the north. The deposits strike northerly and dip westerly at about 25o to 40o. The mineralization comprises irregular, stratiform lenses. The mineralogy of the sulfides is simple and comprises pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, and galena. Gangue minerals include quartz (as chert), clay minerals, carbonate and barite. Noranda recognized six different ore types in its logging of drill core. Typical grades of mineralized intersections within the Lik deposit are listed in the table below:\nPrevious work by GCO determined that sulfides were deposited in four distinct cycles."

      "Seabridge completed its acquisition of the Grassy Mountain Project in April 2003, and in April 2011, signed an option agreement granting Calico the sole and exclusive right and option to earn a 100% interest in the project. During the 2011 exploration program, Calico mapped and sampled the Grassy Mountain deposit and completed three core and nine reverse circulation drill holes in the primary zone of mineralization on the property. Calicoâs exploration strategy was to target areas where resource expansion was most probable. Historical data was thoroughly reviewed prior to drilling, and fresh sets of cross-sections and long-sections were constructed based on existing information. New interpretations of the orientation of mineralization and geology were plotted on the new sections. The new sections were then used to select areas where in-fill drilling was needed and areas where gold mineralization was open-ended and resource expansion probable. A detailed geologic model was produced based on the results of the 2011 exploration work, and subsequent supporting geophysical surveys were completed in March, 2012. On February 5, 2013, Calico exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Grassy Mountain Project from Seabridge. A mineralized material estimate was prepared by Hardrock Consulting Inc. in November, 2014. An independent preliminary economic assessment (âPEAâ) was prepared in February, 2015 by MMC, which verified the mineralized material estimate and included all drill data obtained as of September 26, 2014. The PEA concluded that potential exists for the discovery of additional mineralized material at exploration target areas identified within the Grassy Mountain claim block and the current mineralized material at Grassy Mountain is sufficient to warrant continued planning and effort to explore, permit, and develop the Grassy Mountain Project. There is sufficient data to support a basic geologic model and continuing development of the project and the detailed geologic model described in the PEA, along with the results of the exploration, drilling, and geophysical surveys completed as of October 2014, are sufficient to support preparation of a Preliminary Feasibility Study.",

      "If Seabridge exercises the right to cause Calico to purchase the NPI, the Company would likely need to seek additional equity or other financing to fund the purchase, which financing may not be available to the Company on favorable terms or at all. Bishop Lease\nAn annual lease agreement for unpatented mining claims is currently in place between Calico and the Bishop Brothers. Calico is required to make annual advance royalty payments at a rate of $33,000 per year. In a mining scenario, the agreement provides for a production royalty payment base on the price of gold of 6%. Exploration History at Grassy Mountain\nThe Atlas Era\nIn 1986 Atlas Precious Metals (âAtlasâ) acquired the Grassy Mountain property from two independent geologists, Dick Sherry and Skip Yates. Atlas recognized soil geochemistry as an important tool for locating buried hydrothermal cells at Grassy Mountain. Most of the Atlas exploration targets were identified by claim-corner (600â X 1500â grid) soil sampling anomalies. Atlas conducted detailed soil and float sampling on several anomalies and identified a genetic link between gold mineralization and silicification. Between 1986 and 1991, Atlas completed 403 drill holes totalling 221,500 feet on the Grassy Mountain property. Out of the total, 193 were vertically oriented RC holes on 75 to 100 feet centers within the Grassy Mountain resource area. The remaining drill holes were located on prospects away from the main Grassy Mountain resource area. Many of these represent future exploration targets. Atlas expanded the original claim block and collected additional geologic, mine engineering, civil engineering, and environmental baseline data to support a feasibility study, which was completed in 1990. Declining gold prices and the perception of an unfavorable permitting environment at that time discouraged Atlas from developing the project, and the property was optioned to Newmont Exploration Ltd (âNewmontâ) in 1992. The Newmont Era\nNewmont leased the Grassy Mountain property from Atlas in September 1992 for $30 million."

      "We could be required to either divest our bank subsidiary or divest or cease any activities not permissible for a bank holding company and its affiliates, including our direct and retail businesses. While the consequences of being subject to regulation under the BHCA would be severe, we believe that the risk of being subject to the BHCA is minimal as a result of the precautions we have taken in structuring our business. There are various federal and Nebraska law regulations relating to minimum regulatory capital requirements and requirements concerning the payment of dividends from net profits or surplus, restrictions governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, and general federal and Nebraska regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. At the end of 2004, our bank subsidiary met the requirements for a âwell capitalizedâ institution, the highest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Actâs (FDICIA) five capital ratio levels. A âwell capitalizedâ classification should not necessarily be viewed as describing the condition or future prospects of a depository institution, including our bank subsidiary. FDICIA also requires the FDIC to implement a system of risk-based premiums for deposit insurance pursuant to which the premiums paid by a depository institution will be based on the probability that the FDIC will incur a loss in respect of that institution. The FDIC has since adopted a system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that takes into account an institutionâs capital level and supervisory rating. Subject to certain limitations, federal bank agencies may also require banking organizations such as our bank subsidiary to hold regulatory capital against the full risk-weighted amount of its retained securitization interests.

      "Infrastructure\nThe town, near the former mine, has the following services: diesel generated electrical power, cellular phone service, radio communication (CB), a health center and a school. Because the property was previously in production, it has existing infrastructure that includes power, water, railroad transportation (within 20 kilometers), and a public, all weather road with access year round. The haul roads to the heap leach pads from the open pit area are in good condition and have been maintained by third parties since Glamis halted production, and the heap leach pads used in previous mining operations are still in place. It is our intention to use the existing pads and tailings site to reduce our costs to re-open the mine. Because of this existing infrastructure, we believe that the investment needed to put the mine into production would be less than the\ninvestment that would be required for a mine that was never in production. There are no additional equipment or facilities available to us on the property. Further study is required to review the feasibility and suggested extent of our use of the existing infrastructure of the old mine. Budget\nTo date, we have spent $4,246,000 (Peso 49,967,000) on the exploration of the Cieneguita Property. The proposed exploration budget for the Cieneguita project for 2009 is $1,128,047. This budget does not include any money to be spent by MRT in the event a joint venture agreement is finalized with them. See âPlan of Operationsâ in the âManagementâs Discussion and Analysisâ section for further information.

According to data published by the Government of Mexico, it is at the interphase between the two main volcanic groups that form the bulk of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The location is 220 kilometers to the southwest of Chihuahua City. An all weather dirt road traverses the property.

      "According to information we have obtained, the ore produced at that mine has similar characteristics to the mineralized material we have found from the exploration we have conducted to date on the Solidaridad Property. In the northern part of the Solidaridad Property are two abandoned mines and a few small hand worked mines. To the south of and within the Solidaridad Property exist two additional abandoned mines, all of which will require routine but formal investigation. The Solidaridad Property is accessible by a paved road from the city of Morelia, the capital of MichoacÃ¡n, and the claim sites are accessible by a gravel road from the village of Paso de Nunez. The Solidaridad Property is part of the Sierra Madre mountain range, and rests in an area of valleys and peaks ranging from 610 to 1,100 meters in elevation. The surrounding area is predominantly agrarian. Villages immediately near the claim sites offer little or no amenities; however, there are some hardware, cement, and other suppliers in relatively close proximity. There is no heavy industry in the region. Electricity is currently being provided to us by our contractors through generators. Mining concessions do not automatically grant the holder the right to enter or use the surface land of the property where such mining concessions are located. In order to access the surface land, the holder must obtain permission from the surface owner.

      "The first gold production is anticipated within twelve months after the final permits are received. CIENEGUITA PROJECT, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO\nDuring 1999, 834 ounces of gold were produced at the Cieneguita property compared to 2,823 in 1998 and 1,189 in 1997, but economic production was never achieved. The Company had not established proven and probable reserves at Cieneguita as of December 31, 1999. A scoping study completed in 1998 indicated a bulk base metal operation was not feasible. A small, near-surface precious metal resource was recognized during this study. Additional analysis in 1999 established this resource to have limited potential, not meeting the Company minimum criteria to move the project towards commercial development. Consequently, the decision was made to discontinue work on the project and the Company wrote-off the remaining investment. Reclamation of the pilot operation began in July 1999. Mine workings were reclaimed to be safe, drain runoff freely and minimize erosion. The process facility was dismantled, heaps fully detoxified and reclaimed to normal topography. EXPLORATION\nThe Company expended $4.0 million on various exploration activities in 1999. Exploration efforts were focused on:\n- The Cerro Blanco Property in Guatemala\n- The Marigold Mine property in Humbolt County, Nevada\n-30-\n- The Rand Mine property in Kern County, California\n- Various Nevada prospects\n- The San Martin Project area in Honduras\n- Various Central American prospects\nAt the Cerro Blanco property in southern Guatemala, the 1999 exploration activity included mapping, sampling, metallurgical testwork and drilling of nearly 6,735 meters of mostly reverse circulation drill holes. Based on all the drilling results to date, a geologic resource has been calculated for the Cerro Blanco deposit. Using a cut-off grade of 0.3 grams per tonne, the geologic resource amounts to 2.6 million ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.96 grams per tonne. Of this total resource, 54% of the gold ounces fall into the measured and indicated category and 46% are inferred.",
      "This included 4,576 linear meters of capital mine infrastructure construction and a further 695 meters of vertical rise development. Mine infrastructure improvements include a third surface exhaust fan installation and an underground water pumping station.

All of our processing is taking place using the millâs flotation circuit processing sulfide ore from the La Arista underground mine, as we have not yet utilized the millâs agitated leach circuit. We anticipate that we would use the agitated leach circuit if ever we are able to mine sufficient oxide material from one of our properties.

      "Item 2 âPropertiesâ for a listing of locations of our stores. We have evaluated the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs (SEC) recently issued clarification of lease accounting and we believe that we have accounted for our limited number of lease agreements appropriately. Construction and Store Development. Currently, the average initial net investment to construct a large-format destination retail store ranges from approximately $40 million to $80 million depending on the size of the store, the location and the amount of public improvements necessary. This includes the costs of real estate, site work, public improvements such as utilities and roads, buildings, fixtures (including taxidermy) and inventory. As we continue to open new destination retail stores, we believe that the layout for our future destination retail stores will reflect improvements in our construction processes, materials and fixtures, merchandise layout and store design. These improvements may further enhance the appeal of our destination retail stores to our customers and lower our overall costs. Historically, in connection with the acquisition of land for our new stores, we have attempted to acquire and develop additional land for use by complementary businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, which are adjacent to our destination retail stores. We intend to continue to acquire, develop and sell additional land adjacent to some of our future destination retail stores. We have previously aimed to obtain tailored economic development arrangements from local and state governments where our destination retail stores are located and we expect to obtain similar arrangements in connection with the construction of future destination retail stores. Products and Merchandising\nWe offer our customers a comprehensive selection of high quality, competitively priced, national and regional brand products, including our own Cabelaâs brand.

We believe that sales of these items are less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations than higher priced retail items. Approximately 60% of our capital received from our Offering was invested in existing shopping centers with operating histories and leased to high quality tenants, consisting primarily of multi-tenant centers and mixed-use properties. These investments are primarily shopping centers that are grocery-anchored or mixed-use properties whose tenants consist of national, regional and local retailers. Our grocery-anchored shopping centers are anchored by an established grocery store operator in the region. Our mixed-use properties consists of a combination of office and hospitality tenants that are typically anchored by a combination of national and regional tenants that provide customer traffic and tenant draw for specialty and restaurant tenants that support the local consumer. We also own shopping centers that are leased to national drug stores, national restaurant chains, national value-oriented retail stores and other regional and local retailers. - 10 -\nApproximately 40% of our capital received from our Offering was invested in development and redevelopment properties, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures. We continue to seek to develop properties in locations that provide limited competition, quality demographics and strong market fundamentals. We intend to commence the leasing process before construction of a particular development property. The amount of equity committed to development and redevelopment projects is generally between 25% and 100% of the total cost of the project, with the remaining costs being funded through lines of credit, construction financing or other property level mortgage financing. During 2011, we completed the redevelopment of our Woodlake Square property, and we have initiated the redevelopment of Woodlake Pointe and Preston Towne Crossing.",
      "Item 2. Description of Property\nGeneral\nAt December 31, 2004, we owned 61 properties located in 17 states. Reference is made to the Schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate Owned and Accumulated Depreciation filed with this Form 10-K for a listing of the properties and their respective costs. Since 1995, we have been developing and acquiring multi-tenant shopping centers in our retail partnership business. During this time, we believe we have sharpened our ability to recognize the ideal location of high-end shopping centers and single-tenant properties that can create long-term value which we define as Irreplaceable Corners. Recent downward pressure on single-tenant cap rates has resulted in higher priced single-tenant real estate. As a result, while the company will continue to invest in single-tenant properties located on Irreplaceable Corners, we anticipate strategically increasing our holdings of multi-tenant shopping centers. Multi-tenant shopping centers represent 62.5% of annualized rental income from properties owned as of December 31, 2004. Land - Our property sites, on which our leased buildings sit, range from approximately 34,000 to 1.0 million square feet, depending upon building size and local demographic factors. Sites purchased by the Company are in highly-populated, high-traffic corridors and have been reviewed for traffic and demographic pattern and history. Buildings - The buildings are multi-tenant shopping centers and freestanding single-tenant properties located at âMain and Mainâ locations throughout the United States. They are positioned for good exposure to traffic flow and are constructed from various combinations of stucco, steel, wood, brick and tile. Multi-tenant buildings are generally 14,000 square feet and greater, and single-tenant buildings range from approximately 2,000 to 20,000 square feet. Buildings are suitable for possible conversion to various uses, although modifications may be required prior to use for other operations. Leases - Primary lease terms range from five to 25 years.",

PROPERTIES HELD THROUGH JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS\nAs of December 31, 1998, we held interests in 21 joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with certain unaffiliated third parties (the \"Joint Venture Participants\") that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to the existing agreements with respect to each joint venture, we hold a greater than 50% interest in 16 of the joint ventures and a 50% interest in the remaining joint ventures, but in certain cases such agreements provide that we are a limited partner or that the Joint Venture Participant is principally responsible for day-to-day management of the Property (though in all such cases, we have approval rights with respect to significant decisions involving the underlying properties). Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the Joint Venture Participant may be required to make additional capital contributions, and subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt.",
      "We believe that our current and future cash flow will enable us to undertake the exploitation of our properties through additional drilling activities. Our expected capital budget for development of existing properties in 2007 is approximately $95 million. Pursuing Profitable Acquisitions. We have historically pursued acquisitions of properties that we believe to have exploitation and development potential comparable to our existing inventory of drilling locations. We have developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing core properties. We have an experienced team of management and engineering professionals who identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. While our emphasis in 2007 and beyond is anticipated to focus on the further development of our existing properties, we will continue to look for properties with both existing cash flow from production and future development potential. Controlling Costs through Efficient Operation of Existing Properties. We operate essentially 100% of the pre-tax PV10 value of our total proved reserves, which we believe enables us to better manage expenses, capital allocation and the decision-making processes related to our exploitation and exploration activities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our oil and gas production costs per Boe averaged $6.06 and general and administrative costs averaged $3.39 per Boe produced. Other Properties and Commitments\nWe currently lease our principal executive offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At December 31, 2006, the lease was for approximately 3,224 square feet of office space, at an annual rental of $30,000. This lease expired December 31, 2006 and is continuing on a month to month basis at the same rate. On March 1, 2007, we closed the acquisition of a two story office building, and an adjoining parcel of real estate, located on 6555 South Lewis Avenue in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This office building has approximately 16,000 square feet, and we intend to occupy approximately 12,000 square feet to house our executive offices."

      "This liability is a significant management estimate. Adjustments to the liability are subject to estimation and may change dramatically from period-to-period based on assumptions used for production rates, reserve quantities, commodity pricing, discount rates, production tax rates, and production costs. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $11.4 million to $19.9 million for 2007 compared to $8.5 million for 2006. The increase reflects an increase in our average outstanding borrowings in 2007 compared with 2006. Additionally, the increase reflects that we have $287.5 million of 3.50% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding at December 31, 2007, compared with 100.0 million of 5.75% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2006. We also capitalized $5.4 million of interest in 2007 compared to $3.5 million in 2006. Income tax expense. Income tax expense totaled $110.6 million for 2007 and $105.3 million in 2006, resulting in effective tax rates of 36.8 percent and 35.7 percent, respectively. The effective rate change from 2006 reflects changes in the mix of the highest marginal state tax rates as a result of enacted Texas margin tax legislation, the benefit of federal and state estimated percentage depletion expense, acquisition and drilling activity, and also reflects other permanent differences including differing estimated effects between years of the domestic production activities deduction. The current portion of income tax expense in 2007 is $17.6 million compared to $30.5 million in 2006. These amounts are 16 percent and 29 percent of total income tax expense for the respective periods. The decrease resulted from significant increased drilling activity reflecting the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred, thereby reducing current taxable income. We project that the current portion of taxable income will be similar in 2008. Comparison of Financial Results and Trends between 2006 and 2005\nOil and gas production revenues. Average net daily production increased six percent to a record 254.2 MMCFE for 2006 compared with 239.4 MMCFE in 2005.",
      "This decrease reflects a smaller change in future oil and gas prices as compared to 2005 when we experienced significant increases in prices. Since the prices used in the calculation were much more comparable in the year-end 2006 calculation to that of the 2005 calculation, the degree of increase was much less in 2006. This liability is a significant management estimate. Adjustments to the liability are subject to estimation and may change dramatically from period-to-period based on assumptions used for production rates, reserve quantities, commodity pricing, discount rates, production tax rates, and production costs. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $308,000 to $8.5 million for 2006 compared to $8.2 million for 2005. The increase reflected an increase in our average outstanding borrowings and higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our long-term debt. We also capitalized $3.5 million in 2006 compared to $1.9 million in 2005. Income tax expense. Income tax expense totaled $105.3 million for 2006 and $86.3 million in 2005, resulting in effective tax rates of 35.7 percent and 36.3 percent, respectively. The effective rate change from 2005 reflected changes in the mix of the highest marginal state tax rates as a result of enacted Texas margin tax legislation, the benefit of estimated percentage depletion for both federal and state income taxes, acquisition and drilling activity, and also reflected other permanent differences including differing estimated effects between years of the domestic production activities deduction. The current portion of income tax expense in 2006 was $30.5 million compared to $80.8 million in 2005. These amounts comprised 29 percent and 94 percent of total income tax expense for the respective periods.

      "The decrease in the discount rate to 12 percent resulted from our divestiture marketing process and our assessment that the overall market for oil and gas reserves is ever more competitive.

      "The increase results from the application of the Cash Bonus Plan as amended on March 28, 2008 and an increase in our employee count. The amounts described above were offset by a $9.1 million increase in the amount of G&A that was allocated to exploration expense and an $8.2 million increase in COPAS overhead reimbursements. COPAS overhead reimbursements from operations increased due to an increase in our operated well count from our drilling program. Change in Net Profits Plan liability. For the year ended December 31, 2008, this non-cash item was a benefit of $34.0 million compared to an expense of $50.8 million for the same period in 2007. Significant decreases in oil and gas commodity prices during the last half of 2008 and payments out of the plan have decreased the estimated liability for the future amounts to be paid to plan participants. This liability is a significant management estimate. Adjustments to the liability are subject to estimation and may change dramatically from period to period based on assumptions used for production rates, reserve quantities, commodity pricing, discount rates, tax rates, and production costs. Bad debt expense. We recorded $16.7 million of bad debt expense in 2008, of which $16.6 million was a result of SemGroup, L.P. and certain of its North American subsidiaries filing for bankruptcy protection. Certain SemGroup entities had purchased a portion of our crude oil production. This amount related to oil produced in June and July of 2008 that was fully reserved in the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $380,000 to $20.3 million for 2008 compared to $19.9 million for 2007. The increase reflects an increase in our average outstanding borrowings offset by lower interest rates in 2008 compared with 2007.

Income tax expense totaled $59.9 million for 2008 and $110.6 million for 2007, resulting in effective tax rates of 39.5 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively.",
      "DD&A expense per MCFE increased 27 percent to $2.12 in 2007 compared to $1.67 in 2006. The increase reflects overall upward cost pressure in the industry and specifically our drilling in 2007 and 2006 that added costs at a higher per unit rate relative to the prior yearâs base. The DD&A per MCFE rate was further affected by upward adjustments to reserves due to pricing differences between December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006 although this had the impact of lowering DD&A. Exploration expense. Exploration expense increased $6.8 million or 13 percent to $58.7 million in 2007 compared with $51.9 million for 2006. This increase is due to a $7.5 million increase in geologic and geophysical expense to support a larger overall program as well as a $4.2 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense related to three wells located in the Gulf Coast region and one in the Rockies region. These increases were offset by a $4.9 million decrease in exploration overhead expense related to a reduction in amounts recorded in exploration expense related to payments under the Net Profits Plan. In 2007, we had a change in our accounting estimate to reflect the view that Net Profits Plan distributions should be reclassified to exploration overhead only for individuals who are currently employed by us and who continue to be involved in our exploration efforts. Therefore Net Profits Plan payments associated with the distributions under the Net Profits Plan for ex-employees were reclassified to general and administrative expense since there is no longer any functional link to exploration expense as there is by definition no periodic cost associated with geologic, geophysical and exploration related work by those ex-employees. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $21.3 million or 55 percent to $60.1 million for 2007, compared with $38.9 million for 2006. G&A increased $0.14 to $0.56 per MCFE for 2007 compared to $0.42 per MCFE for the period in 2006 as G&A grew at a faster rate than the 16 percent increase in production."

      "Subsequently, RME nearly completed permitting and licensing for a commercial scale ISR facility. In 1992 the project approximately covering the area of our current Reno Creek and North Reno Creek Project was acquired by EFN from RME. Over the next decade EFN and its successor, International Uranium Corporation (now Denison Mines), continued to advance the project toward full permitting and licensing. Subsequently, Rio Algom and Power Resources held the project until dropping all of their interests in 2003. Between 2006 and 2008 Uranerz acquired mineral and surface land interests covering approximately 1,280 acres of fee mineral leases and federal mining claims comprising the North Reno Creek Project. In June 2015, EFN acquired Uranerz, whose development assets included the North Reno Creek Project. Geologic characteristics of the North Reno Creek Project are similar to the permitted Reno Creek resource areas since the sandstone units are adjacent and contiguous. The uranium deposits within each of these areas occur in medium to coarse-grained sand facies in the lower portion of the Eocene-age Wasatch Formation. The uranium mineralization occurs as interstitial fillings between and coatings on the sand grains along roll front trends formed within the host sandstone aquifers.

      "TXCO contracts with Netherland Sewell & Associates, a Dallas-based engineering firm to provide reserve estimates for reporting purposes. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties\nThe Company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. The Company estimates the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets, events may arise that would require the Company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties. The Company has recognized impairments in prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future. Income Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income and other similar taxes on its operations. When recording income tax expense or benefit, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of the calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses or benefits are recognized. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization.",
      "The expected future cash flows are estimated based on the Partnershipâs plans to continue to produce proved reserves. Expected future cash flow from the sale of production of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices. The Partnership estimates prices based upon current contracts in place, adjusted for basis differentials and market related information including published futures prices. The estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates. If the carrying value exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future cash flows) and the carrying value of the assets. The determination of oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a subjective process and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary considerably from actual results. There were no impairments of proved oil and gas properties recorded by the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Partnership recognized a $160,644,700 asset impairment related to oil and gas properties, net of an offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income of $12,071,800. This impairment related to the carrying amount of these oil and gas properties being in excess of its estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2008. The estimate of fair value of these oil and gas properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas prices. Working Interest\nThe Partnership Agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to the MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions (âworking interestâ).",
      "If the Company's cash flow from operations and available credit are not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements. Reliance on Estimates of Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flow necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary significantly. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves likely will vary from estimates, and such variances may be material. In addition, the Company's reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon production history, results of future development, oil and gas prices, performance of counterparties under agreements to which the Company is a party, operating and development costs and other factors. The PV-10 values referred to herein should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the Company's properties.",
      "As a result, the 2007 Net Profits Plan pool was the last pool established. Asset retirement obligations. We are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties. We base our estimate of the liability on our historical experience in abandoning oil and gas wells projected into the future based on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements. Our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties, assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates, and determine what credit adjusted risk-free rate to use. The impact to the consolidated statement of operations from these estimates is reflected in our depreciation, depletion, and amortization calculations and occurs over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties. Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets. Our property and equipment are recorded at cost. An impairment allowance is provided on unproven property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our proved properties and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be appropriate. Our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenues from property, using escalated pricing, with the related net capitalized cost of the property at the end of each period. When the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property, the cost of the property is written down to our estimate of fair value, which is determined by applying a discount rate that we believe is indicative of the current market. Our criteria for an acceptable internal rate of return are subject to change over time. Different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment. We recorded a $302.2 million impairment of proved oil and gas properties in 2008.",
      "We lease approximately 74,000 square feet of office space. Our current payment approximates $135,000 per month and our lease will expire in December 2014. Production During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, six months ended December 31, 2005 and fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 we have not had, nor do we now have, any long-term supply or similar agreements with governments or authorities under which we acted as producer. Impairment of Long Lived Assets\nOn a quarterly basis, we compare our historical cost basis of each proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas property to its expected future undiscounted cash flow from each property (on a field by field basis). Estimates of expected future cash flows represent managementâs best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. If the expected future cash flows exceed the carrying value of the property, no impairment is recognized. If the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment exists and is measured by the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company recorded an impairment provision of approximately $58.4 million to developed properties primarily related to the Howard Ranch and Fuller fields in Wyoming ($37.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively), and the South Angleton field in Texas ($9.7 million), primarily due to lower Rocky Mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the Howard Ranch Prospect. During the year ended December 31, 2006, an impairment of $10.4 million was recorded on certain of our eastern Colorado properties primarily due to lower Rocky Mountain natural gas prices. In addition, an impairment of $1.0 million was recorded on certain Oklahoma properties. During the six months ended December 31, 2005, a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in Orange County, California. We determined that we would not pursue development in the prospect and accordingly an impairment of $1.3 million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect."

      "In other exposures, the contact is a post-intrusive fault contact or localized detachment fault. Other lithologies in the District include silica breccias, jasperoids and assorted (locally tuffaceous) volcanics, minor small, intrusive plugs and dikes of probable Tertiary age also occur in the area. Most of the present-day surface is covered with colluvial slope wash and the canyons and narrow washes have alluvial fill of various thicknesses. The Kiewit historic gold zone is hosted within a structural zone traceable on the surface for a distance of approximately 2.5 miles across the full length of the Kiewit project area and beyond. This structure trends north-north-easterly with a gentle westerly dip ranging 20-30 degrees, often occupying dip-slopes across the area. The zone comprises a 30 to 165-foot-thick, gently westerly dipping gold bearing oxidized quartz stockwork section in granodiorite. The zone is mostly exposed on the surface and occupies the dip-slope located at the southern part of the Kiewit project area. Projected western and northern extensions of the stockwork dip under Carboniferous Sedimentary rocks, although it is ultimately truncated by the Rodenhouse Fault located approximately 2,500 feet to the west. The Kiewit gold zone is part of a typical low-sulfidation gold bearing epithermal system. It is manifested as a zone of quartz and quartz-carbonate veining and stockworks within the more laterally extensive (2.5 miles long and up to 1,650 feet wide) Kiewit structural zone fault/fracture system. The Kiewit structural zone comprises a group of lithologies overlying a major fault zone that is manifested as a three to 16 feet thick silica breccia unit in granodiorite. A basal three to six-foot thick quartz-carbonate vein overlies this basal silica breccia and is followed up-section by a fault-bounded interval of relatively unaltered granodiorite that forms the footwall of the stockworks. At some locations, this footwall granodiorite is absent and the stockwork zone is instead in fault-contact with the basal quartz-carbonate vein.",

The footwall of the stockwork zone is defined by faulting, with a north-north-easterly trend and shallow westerly dip. The âfootwallâ fault appears to have developed after the stockwork and served to juxtapose altered and mineralized rocks of the historic gold zone over relatively mineralized and fresh granodiorite. The amount of displacement along this fault is unknown and the structure may be regarded as a detachment zone.",

The amount of displacement along this fault is unknown and the structure may be regarded as a detachment zone. Precious metals mineralization at Kiewit occurs primarily as electrum and is hosted in a stockwork zone associated with a low angle fault zone. The stockwork zone comprises argillic-propylitic altered granodiorite with randomly oriented to anastomosing veinlets, as well as veins with variable mix of white to grey chalcedony/quartz and white to beige carbonate and adularia. The veins are commonly less than two centimeters wide but larger veins with apparent thickness up to one meter or greater are present on surface and in diamond drill core. The larger veins display typical epithermal style open space fillings and have variable textures. The mineralized stockwork is reported by Dumont to generally contain up to 30 randomly oriented veinlets making up 30% of the rock volume. The highest gold grades are also reported by Dumont to generally be associated with the larger veins or where vein density is greatest which suggests that the gold mineralization is spatially associated with the quartz-carbonate veins. Kiewit Exploration Programs and Mining Activities\nThe Kiewit mining claims are without known reserves but beginning in 2014 the Company started extraction of gold without determining mineral reserves. The Kiewit mine is a small open pit, heap leach operation that produces gold and silver. Initial production at Kiewit commenced in June 2014 and was suspended in June 2016. Production was suspended due to low metal prices and undercapitalized operations. A fresh water well failure in July 2016, due to suspected sabotage, caused a complete leach pad shut-down. Fresh water pumping was re-started in mid-March 2017 mostly to reduce solution volumes as no sodium cyanide (NaCN) was being added.",
      "The Project area is located within the Basin and Range Province of Central Arizona. Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary sequences rest unconformably on Proterozoic metamorphic and granitic rocks. Middle Miocene faulting has dissected the tertiary sequences into a series of north-northwest homoclines that dip to the northeast. The gold and silver mineralization at the Newsboy Project occurs in a shallow dipping, major brecciated shear zone referred to as the Newsboy Fault, which forms the local unconformable contact between the overlying brittle Tertiary volcanics and underlying Proterozoic metamorphic basement rocks. This contact is a shallow dipping, blanket-like breccia ranging from 50 feet to 120 feet thick. The deposit is cut by a series of northwest trending high angle faults, resulting in the Newsboy ore body being progressively down dropped to the east. The deposit is terminated on the west by one of these high angle faults, referred to as the âWash Faultâ but is open to the north, south and down dip. Mineralization occurs in veins of white to light green banded quartz and is very low in sulphide minerals. The gold and silver appear to have been introduced into the breccia with silica by a series of low temperature epithermal pulses of mineralized fluids partially filled open spaced fractures. Extensive silicification accompanied mineralization and has been later overprinted by black, manganiferous calcite veining. The gold deposition is surrounded by intense oxidizing hydrothermal activity that has altered the rhyolitic rocks to various assemblages of quartz, alunite and kaolinite. The Newsboy breccia mineralization is exposed in Wash Fault which marks the western boundary of the ore body. Elsewhere, Quaternary sediments, up to 60 feet in depth, cover the breccia. Klondike Project\n(1) Location\nThe central part of the Klondike claim block is located in the Alpha Mining District approximately 30 miles north from the town of Eureka in central Nevada (Figure 1). The property is accessed by traveling 3 miles north from Eureka on US Hwy 50, thence 30 miles north on Nevada Highway 278, thence east 2 miles along various dirt roads."

By letter dated May 11, 1999, the Company informed the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (the \"Ministry\") that the recent sharp drop in the market prices of the metals to be produced from the mine at Al Masane, as a result of the economic crisis in southeast Asia, made implementation of the development of the mine uneconomical at that time and that, as a result, the Company would delay implementation of the project until metal prices recovered. The Ministry notified the Company one year later that it must immediately implement the project and in the Fall of 2000 further notified the Company that the project should be immediately implemented or the mining lease would be terminated. A second notice from the Ministry several weeks later stated that the Committee of the Supreme Council of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia had recommended giving the Company six months to take positive steps to implement the project. A written notice from the Ministry in the Summer of 2001 stated that the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia had issued a resolution in which it refused the Company's request to postpone implementation of the project, that the Company must start implementation of the project within six months of the date of the resolution and that, if the project was not then started, the Ministry was authorized to begin procedures to terminate the mining lease. Subsequent correspondence from the Ministry in the Fall and Winter of 2001 and into 2002 reiterated the threat to terminate the mining lease if the project was not immediately implemented. A letter from the Ministry in March 2002 stated that the six-month period to implement the project had expired without the Company taking positive steps towards that end."

      "In May 2006, InnovExplo Inc., a mining and exploration Consulting Firm in Mines and Exploration based in Val-DâOr, QuÃ©bec, completed an National Instrument 43-101 compliant report that indicates that the Discovery zone contains an indicated resource of 381,100 tonnes @ 6.74 g/t Au and an inferred resource of 847,200 tonnes @ 6.35 g/t Au. The report indicates that the gold-bearing zones are continuous, and that the potential for converting the\n- 7 -\ninferred resource into an indicated resource is high. The report also mentions that there is strong potential for increasing the resource through additional drilling, particularly at depth, below the known gold-bearing zones. For the Discovery Claims Block, the following parameters were used to define the indicated and inferred resources: Indicated Resource\nThe indicated resource was defined in areas where the mineralized lenses can be delineated by a series of drill hole intercepts with a grade greater than 3.00 g/t over 1.6 m and a maximum drill holes spacing of 60 m. In some areas where there was insufficient information to confirm the presence of the mineralized zone on the other side of the fault, the limits of the lenses were confined by these late faults. Only the B zone contains an indicated resource, in three distinct lenses. The other zones are characterized only by an inferred resource. Inferred Resource\nA radius of 40 metres from a single diamond drill hole intercept was used to define the inferred resource. In the B zone, one mineralized lens located between Sections 600 W and 350 W and between elevations-350 m and 0 m is defined by four diamond drill hole intercepts with grade higher than 3.00 g/t over 1.6 m. The maximum distance between drill holes is 130 m and the minimum is 100 m. The shape of the inferred lenses is based on the shape and size of indicated lenses. All the volume contained within these other lenses has been defined as inferred. The late faults were not used to limit the inferred resource. These faults cause a few meters of displacement, but even though the exact location of the mineralized zone is not well known, the zone should continue on the other side, and therefore the volume is not affected.",
      "Therefore a consultant will fix minimum requirement of grade, true widths and continuity for him to be able to do a calculation of the resources. The consultant, InnovExplo recommends using a minimum cut-off of 3g/t AU in evaluating the resources of the Discovery property. The resource was also calculated using a 5.00 g/t. The results show that continuity is still good at this cut-off. The 7.00 g/t Au cut-off value indicates some high grade zones in the deposit. The tonnage and ounces are sensitive to grade and decrease rapidly at the higher 7.00 g/t Au cut-off, indicating the limited amount of high grade tonnage currently in the deposit. In May 2007, the Company obtained new results from a second evaluation pursuant to norms of Canadian NI 43-101 based on 39 drill holes covering an area of 26,300 meters realised between October 2006 and March 2007. The new Measured and Indicated resources are now estimated at 1,163,186 tonnes at an average grade of 5.53 g/t for a total of 206,624 ounces of gold, representing an increase of more than 150% in gold content over the previous May 2006 43-101 estimate for the same categories (381,100 tonnes at 6.74 g/t for 82,406 ounces of gold). In addition to these Measured and Indicated resources, a total of 966,864 tonnes at an average grade of 6.06 g/t for 188,510 ounces of gold are now classified as Inferred resources. This represents a 9% increase in ounces contained over the previous May 2006 43-101 estimate for the same category (847,200 tonnes at 6.35 g/t for 173,091 ounces of gold). The average horizontal width of the intercepts for the Measured and Indicated gold resources is more than 3.9 meters. Furthermore, InnovExplo concludes in its report that the gold zones remain open at depth and along strike. - 10 -\nDISCOVERY GOLD PROJECT ESTIMATED RESOURCES\nGrade\nOunces\nTonnes\n(g/t Au)\nContained\nMeasured\n3,109\n8.95\nIndicated\n1,160,077\n5.52\n205,729\nTotal: Measured and Indicated\n1,163,186\n5.53\n206,624\nInferred\n966,864\n6.06\n188,510\nThe same technical parameters were used in the 2006 and 2007 resource estimates, as follows:\n-\nThe polygonal method on longitudinal section was used.\n-\nA cut-off grade of 3 g/t Au and a minimum horizontal width of 1.6 metres.\n-\nHigh gold values capped to 35 g/t.\n-\nAn average density of 2.82 tonnes/cubic meter.",
      "The results of the ORE resource estimate, which was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, showed the known Brimstone deposit at a cutoff grade of 0.005 ounces per ton cyanide-soluble gold contains an estimated 52.7 million tons of mineralized material at a grade of 0.019 ounces of gold per ton, and were previously reported by Vista Gold in a press release dated August 4, 2005. Proven and probable mineral reserves were determined within a design pit based on a US$450 per ounce gold price employing a Lerchs-Grossman optimization. The results are summarized in the following table:\n(1)Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors concerning estimates of Proven and Probable Reserves: The estimates of mineral reserves shown in this table have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101. The definitions of proven and probable reserves used in NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Accordingly, the disclosure of mineral reserves herein may not be comparable to information from U.S. companies subject to the SEC's reporting and disclosure requirements. Exploration\nWe believe there is significant potential to extend the oxide mineralization to the south, along strike, at both the Central Fault and Brimstone deposits, but the greatest upside lies in the largely unexplored sulfide mineralization below the Brimstone deposit, as well as higher grade intercepts along the Central Fault. Current mineralized material at Brimstone is limited to the oxide cap of an apparently large but previously unexplored gold-bearing sulfide system. Two diamond drill holes, drilled in 1996 and earlier, intercepted mineralized sulfides averaging 0.023 ounces per ton gold and 0.5 ounces per ton silver over intervals exceeding 500 feet in thickness. In 1996, the Corporation also intercepted 30 feet of gold mineralization in drill hole 95-2728. This intercept assayed 0.155 ounces per ton gold at a true depth of 310 feet below surface. The hole terminated in this mineralization; the true width of the mineralization is not known.",
      "In April, 2011 a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was completed by Gustavson Associates, LLC to evaluate a limited number of vein-like structures primarily in the Discovery Zone. Mineralization was modeled using Indicator Kriging to analyze zones of potential high grade mineralization. This indicator model was calibrated by comparison with veins modeled on cross sections, and appears to have identified higher grade areas with continuous gold mineralization that could possibly be mined by underground methods. Tonopah Project Initial Inferred Mineral Underground Resource*\n* - Inferred mineral resources are estimated pursuant to Canadian industry standards. See âCautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimatesâ above. The report was prepared by William J. Crowl, Donald E. Hulse, Donald J. Baker, and Terre A. Lane, under the supervision of Gustavson who are âindependentâ and \"qualified persons\" as defined under NI 43-101. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion regarding Sampling and Analysis and Security of Analysis, please see the report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Midway Project, Nye County, Nevada\" dated effective April 1, 2011, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. Following the resource estimate, core drilling was conducted at Tonopah to define the true width and continuity of gold grade in veins and wall rock. A total of 13,000 feet was drilled in 26 holes to test areas of the Discovery, 121, Dauntless, and 63-77 areas. Initial assay results indicated some high grade intercepts including 1.3 feet of 9.768 ounces per ton (opt) gold and 5 feet of 2.287 opt gold within a zone of 150 feet of 0.224 opt gold in drill hole MW11-09c as well as lower grade intercepts including 145 feet of 0.033 opt gold in MW11-06c. See our press release dated December 8, 2011 for full results. In 2012, modeling of the veins was continued based on the 2011 drill results. No drilling was done in 2013 or 2014 as the Company focused its efforts at the Pan and Gold Rock projects."

      "On February 2, 1993, a selective strike was commenced by the UMWA against another coal company, which strike later expanded to other coal companies. The operations of the Company's independent operating subsidiaries were not interrupted by that strike, but pursuant to an agreement (Assistance Agreement) among members of the BCOA, Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries made payments for the benefit of BCOA members that were struck. The selective strike ended and obligations in respect of such strike under the Assistance Agreement also ended on March 2, 1993, when the UMWA and BCOA agreed to extend the 1988 Wage Agreement to May 3, 1993. However, on May 18, 1993, each of Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries were struck by the UMWA. On December 16, 1993, union miners returned to work at the mines of Hobet and the Dal-Tex Subsidiaries following ratification of the Wage Agreement on December 14, 1993. The Wage Agreement provides for a total wage increase of $1.30 per hour over the first three years of the contract, changes in medical coverage providing for deductibles and copayments, more flexible work rules that will permit coal production to take place 24 hours a day and seven days a week, increases in employer contributions to an education and retraining fund, and employer contributions to fund the new Labor Management Positive Change Program and the new 1993 Benefit Fund created by the Wage Agreement. The contract provisions of the Wage Agreement applicable to wages, pensions and medical benefits are fixed for the first three years of the contract, but thereafter wages and pension benefits are subject to renegotiation at the UMWA's election and certain provisions of the medical plan are subject to renegotiation at either the UMWA's or the BCOA's election. The Labor Management Positive Change Program mandated by the Wage Agreement establishes a board comprised of union and management representatives to explore methods of increasing productivity and efficiency. In connection with the Wage Agreement, the UMWA and BCOA also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding that requires that certain jobs at mines of Ashland Coal's nonunion subsidiaries be offered to UMWA miners under the following conditions.",
      "The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 generally requires each coal mine operator to secure payment of federal and state black lung benefits to its employees through insurance, bonds or contributions to a state-controlled fund. The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 also provides for the payment from a trust fund of benefits and medical expenses to employees for whom no benefits have been obtainable from their employer. This trust is financed by a tax on coal sales. The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Benefit Act) addressed two underfunded trust funds which were to provide medical benefits for certain UMWA retirees. The Benefit Act provides for the funding of medical and death benefits for certain retired members of the UMWA through premiums to be paid by assigned operators (former employers), transfers of monies from an overfunded pension trust established for the benefit of retired UMWA members, and transfers from the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund, which is funded by a federal tax on coal production. This funding arrangement commenced February 1, 1993. Some former employers have filed suits challenging the constitutionality of the Benefit Act, but the eventual outcome of such litigation is uncertain. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY\nThe Company's independent operating subsidiaries endeavor to conduct their operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry. Mingo Logan and Dal-Tex are each a party to civil proceedings as a result of alleged failures to comply with mandatory federal or state health and safety regulations. Each of these proceedings involves a fatality and could result in the imposition of civil penalties. The Company believes that any adverse result, if incurred, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity."

      "Because the producer delivering volumes to the Company under the volumetric production payment contract failed to reimburse the Company for operating expenses advanced by the Company, in 1998 the Company foreclosed on and acquired all of the working interests in the wells. The major property on which the wells are located is the Mayfield - 28 Field. Wilburton Field, Oklahoma\nThe Company's 1998 activity in the Wilburton Field, Latimer County, Oklahoma featured the drilling of the prolific Commissioner #14-1 well which is producing from the Atoka Bullard sand at approximately 10,000 feet in depth. The Company owns a 69% working interest in and is the operator of this well. Two more productive wells have recently been drilled to the Bullard in this field with the Company owning a 10% and a 7% working interest, respectively. Additional drilling is planned for 1999 to further develop the Atoka sands on the Company's acreage holdings of 800 gross (235 net) acres. Mills Ranch Field, Texas\nThe Company owns working interests varying from less than 1% to approximately 25% in 25 producing wells in this Wheeler County, Texas field. The deep Hunton formation at approximately 20,000 feet in depth has been the primary producing zone. During the last year, several companies including KCS have been successfully developing the shallower Granite Wash interval at approximately 11,500 feet in depth with four wells drilled in 1998. The Company plans to participate in a number of additional wells in 1999 to further develop Granite Wash reserves on its 7,807 gross (1,850 net) acres in this field. West Shugart Field, New Mexico\nThe Company recently completed a well in the West Shugart Field located in Eddy County, New Mexico, in which it has a 100% working interest. During an initial 24-hour test on November 6, 1998, the Shugart Federal #19-1 well flowed at a rate exceeding 1,000 bbl of oil per day and 230 Mcf of gas per day from the Bore Springs Dolomite formation at approximately 8,200 feet. Since that time, the well has been flowing at a restricted steady rate of approximately 230 bbl of oil per day as dictated by New Mexico regulations.",

The Company acquired additional working interests in the Langham Creek Area in May 1997, which added 14,000 MMcfe of proved reserves and the potential for significant additional reserves for approximately $17 million. With this acquisition, the Company's third in a series of acquisitions in this field, KCS assumed operatorship and now owns working interests varying from 33% to 100% in 19 wells in this area, representing an average net revenue interest of approximately 46%. The geological and geophysical evidence indicates the potential for as many as four to eight additional development drilling locations, with the upper-middle Wilcox sands as the primary target. In addition, the Company has initiated a 3-D seismic survey to better delineate potential drilling locations not only for the known productive horizons, but also for a deeper, high potential exploration prospect. Results of the 3-D seismic survey are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 1998 and could change the number of potential drilling locations. Bob West Field\nThe Company has interests in approximately 863 gross (599 net) acres in this field located in Zapata and Starr Counties, Texas. Historically, the Bob West field had been the Company's most significant producing property, accounting for approximately 34% of gas production and 61% of oil and gas revenues during the six-year period ended December 31, 1996. In 1997, production from the Bob West Field accounted for less than 5% of total production and oil and gas revenue. The field produces natural gas from a series of 20 different Upper Wilcox sands with formation depths ranging from 9,500 to 13,500 feet that require stimulation by hydraulic fracturing to effectively recover the reserves. Because the majority of this field is situated under Lake Falcon on the Rio Grande River, most wells were drilled directionally under the lake from common lakeshore drill sites.",
      "The Company owns working interests varying from 22% to 65% in 12 wells in this area, representing an average net revenue interest of approximately 33%. The geological and geophysical evidence indicates the potential for as many as six to nine additional drilling locations, with the upper Wilcox sands as the primary target. Laurel Ridge Field. The Company is the operator of this field located in Iberville Parish, Louisiana and has a 26% net revenue interest in 3,773 gross (1,320 net) acres around two discovery wells. The #1 Claiborne Plantation was completed in August 1995 in the Cibicides hazzardi (Frio) sand and the second discovery, the #2 Claiborne Plantation, was completed in December 1995 in the shallower Miogyp (Frio) formation. Based on the results of the first two discovery wells and 2-D seismic surveys, the Company drilled two additional step-out wells in July and October 1996 which were temporarily abandoned. The Company has deferred future development until the completion of a 3-D seismic survey. Glasscock Ranch Field. This field is located in Colorado County, Texas. The Company and its partners leased approximately 2,800 acres and in 1994 drilled and completed the #5 Glasscock well as a natural gas well in the upper portion of the lower Wilcox sand section, a new reservoir for the field. The Company has recently increased its working interest to approximately 85% and plans to implement a development drilling program for 1997. Tensas Parish Area. The Company currently has leases or options covering 32,300 acres in this area and in mid-1996 initiated an exploration and development drilling program in its St. Jo (now referred to as the Aubrey and Wilsonia Fields), Barfield and Chicago Mills prospects. The Company currently owns a 100% working interest in these three prospects. Of the eight wells drilled in 1996 in the Aubrey and Wilsonia Fields, seven were completed and one was a dry hole. Six of the completed wells targeted the lower Tuscaloosa at a depth of approximately 8,300 feet and one well targeted the Wilcox at a depth of 3,200 feet.",
      "Development drilling on these acquired properties began in 1992 and continued into 1999. Presently, the Company is actively involved in an exploration and development program in South Texas and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company's properties in this region number 663 wells and include 252 Bcfe of proved reserves. The Company drilled 26 wells in the Gulf Coast Region during 1999 and daily production averaged 120 MMcfe per day. The Company has identified 75 undrilled locations in this region of which 38 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves. Plans for this region in 2000 include the drilling of approximately 32 wells and a total investment of $104 million, including acreage and seismic acquisition. Lavaca County Area\nThe Company began its involvement in Lavaca County, Texas, in 1996 to explore and drill primarily for the Lower Wilcox formation. Secondary targets include the shallower Upper Wilcox, Miocene, Frio and Yegua targets. Working interests in these projects, including the Yoakum Gorge and S.W. Speaks projects, initially ranged from 25% to 35%. Subsequent acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 have more than doubled the Company's interests in these projects. The Company has additionally expanded its position in the Wilcox Trend further to the east to include the Provident City field. The Company now holds working interests ranging from 30% to 87.5% in 60,000 gross acres in Lavaca County. Since this project began, the Company has participated in 50 Lower Wilcox wells, over 90% of which have successfully been completed as producers. Approximately 200 square miles of high-fold 3D seismic data was obtained in 1996 and 1997 which continues to be evaluated. An additional 50 square miles of 3D seismic was shot on the South Borchers prospect in late 1998 which is a southern extension to existing data. The Company is currently participating in a 60 plus square mile 3D shoot to the west of its current acreage holdings. The data will be available in the first quarter of 2000. The target zones are the Lower Wilcox sands from 10,000 to 17,000 feet and the shallow Miocene, Frio, Yegua and Upper Wilcox sands ranging in depth from 3,500 to 8,000 feet."

Continuing into 2006, Silverado installed about 900 feet of exploration drifts by underground tunneling methods into the Swede Channel. Prior bulk sampling had shown the channel to contain gold in the basal gravels, so the project was designed to obtain a large bulk sample from the tunnel being advanced into the channel. The 2005-2006 winter stockpile contained 8,896 LCY of gravel material, and was processed between June 28th through July 20th of 2006, yielding 939.07 troy ounces of gold nuggets and dust. The Swede portal was re-opened in early November of 2006, and gravel extraction on the remaining sections of the Swede Channel continued until its completion by the middle of January 2007. A total of 8,963 LCY of gravel material was stockpiled from the remaining Swede Channel. In early January 2007, crews installed a portal into Maryâs East, and began an underground drift into the Maryâs East deposit. The Maryâs East project was completed at the end of March 2007 and 9,357 LCY of gravel material was stockpiled from this project. The 2006-2007 winter stockpile contained 18,320 LCY (Swede Channel and Maryâs East combined) of gravel material, and was processed from June through July of 2007 at the existing sluice plant location, yielding 2,811.74 troy ounces of gold nugget gold and over 207 pounds of concentrate that contained gold particles smaller than 1/4 inch in size."

      "Employees\nThe number of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries decreased from 6,507 at December 31, 1993 to 5,160 at December 31, 1994. The number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at December 31, 1994 was 2,449. The decrease in the number of employees is primarily due to an early retirement/severance package offered by the Company in 1994 and to an involuntary severance program implemented as part of the Company's restructuring activities in 1994. Effective February 13, 1995, approximately 390 positions were outsourced as part of a ten-year agreement with ISSC to manage most of the Company's information technology systems and network infrastructure. Research and Development\nThe Company and its utility subsidiaries spent approximately $3.8 million in 1994, $4.3 million in 1993 and $4.8 million in 1992 on research and development. The major portion of those expenditures went to utility associations which engage in research projects to benefit the electric and gas industries as a whole. The balance of the expenditures went for smaller internal and external projects dealing with such areas as pollution control and alternative fuels research. Nuclear Property\nFort St. Vrain, near Platteville, the Company's only nuclear generating station, ceased operations on August 29, 1989 (see Note 2. Fort St. Vrain in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA). Transmission and Distribution Property\nOn December 31, 1994, the Company's transmission system consisted of approximately 182 circuit miles of 345 Kv overhead lines; 1,832 circuit miles of 230 Kv overhead lines; 15 circuit miles of 230 Kv underground lines; 65 circuit miles of 138 Kv overhead lines; 965 circuit miles of 115 Kv overhead lines; 19 circuit miles of 115 Kv underground lines; 355 circuit miles of 69 Kv overhead lines; 170 circuit miles of 44 Kv overhead lines; and 1 circuit mile of 44 Kv underground lines. The Company jointly owns with another utility approximately 347 circuit miles of 345 Kv overhead lines and 330 miles of 230 Kv overhead lines, of which the Company's share is 182 miles and 114 miles, respectively, which shares are included in the amounts listed above.",
      "EMPLOYEES AND LABOR\nLabor and related expenses accounted for approximately 38% of the Company's railroad operating expenses in 1994. At December 31, 1994, the Company employed 18,010 persons, which represents a reduction of approximately 972 from January 1, 1994. The December 31, 1994 employment figure includes 17,785 employed in the Company's rail operations. These reductions resulted from attrition and voluntary separations, severance, early retirement programs and furloughs. At December 31, 1994, approximately 88% of the Company's railroad employees were covered by collective\nbargaining agreements with railway labor organizations that are organized along craft lines, where employees are grouped together by job and historical practice. Historically, many collective bargaining agreements in the railroad industry have been negotiated on a nationwide basis with the railroads being represented by the National Railway Labor Conference. In November 1993, the Company withdrew its participation with the National Railway Labor Conference with respect to the current bargaining round indicating it would negotiate wage and work rule agreements separately from any nationwide negotiations conducted by other Class I railroads. Labor relations in the railroad industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"). The most recent national collective bargaining agreements with the major railway labor organizations and the railroads, including the Company, expired in 1988, and negotiations failed to resolve the wage and work rule issues. After various presidential and legislative actions in 1991, because of its constrained financial condition, the Company was authorized to negotiate separately with certain of its employee unions, rather than on a nationwide basis with the railroads being represented by a bargaining committee, as is typically the case. These negotiations resulted in wage rates that are lower than the national rates for most of the Company's union employees and relieved the Company of the requirement to make certain lump sum payments to employees.",
      "Indicates position held at least since January 1, 2000. Employees\nAs of January 1, 2005, FirstEnergyâs nonutility subsidiaries and the Companies had a total of 15,245 employees located in the United States as follows:\nApproximately 7,218 of the above employees (including 720 for OE, 635 for CEI, 317 for TE, 153 for Penn, 1,155 for JCP&L, 490 for Met-Ed and 605 for Penelec) are covered by collective bargaining agreements. On December 8, 2004, employees represented by IBEW System Council U-3 began a strike against JCP&L. JCP&L continues to utilize management, other non-union personnel from around FirstEnergy's system and contractors to perform service reliability and priority maintenance work while the union members are on strike. The labor agreement between JCP&L and System Council U-3 originally expired on October 31, 2003 but was extended several times and ultimately expired on December 7, 2004. JCP&L and the leadership of System Council U-3 continue to negotiate in an attempt to reach a new agreement and end the work stoppage. It is unknown when such an agreement will be reached or when the work stoppage will end. On January 31, 2005, IBEW Local 245, ratified a three-year contract agreement with TE, FENOC, and FGCO. On February 4, 2005, IBEW Local 272, representing approximately 350 employees of the Bruce Mansfield Plant, ratified a three-year contract with FGCO.\nFirstEnergy Website\nEach of the registrant's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are also made available free of charge on or through FirstEnergy's internet website at www.firstenergycorp.com.

      "The financial information about geographic areas contained in\nNote 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this Report is incorporated herein by reference. Employees\nAs of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 2,675 employees, approximately 1,400 of whom were working in foreign countries. In addition, the Company also employed at such date approximately 470 seasonal or temporary employees, primarily in the HTH water products business. Approximately 170 of the hourly paid U.S. employees of the Company located at its Brandenburg, Kentucky; Conley, Georgia; and Lake Charles, Louisiana facilities are represented for purposes of collective bargaining by several different labor organizations, and the Company is party to eight labor contracts relating to such employees. These labor contracts extend for three- or four-year terms and expire in the years 2006 and 2007. No major work stoppages have occurred in the last three years. While relations between the Company and its employees and their various representatives are generally considered satisfactory, there can be no assurance that new labor contracts can be entered into without work stoppages. European hourly employees are also represented by unions in various countries. Responsible CareÂ® Commitment\nFirst adopted as a condition of membership by the American Chemistry Council (âACCâ) in 1988, the Responsible CareÂ® initiative was developed to encourage member companies to continuously improve their performance in the realms of health, safety and the environment. The ACCâs Responsible CareÂ® initiative encompasses seven critical performance areas: employee health and safety, pollution prevention, manufacturing process safety, security, distribution safety, product stewardship and community awareness and emergency response. Ultimately, this initiative is aimed at making health, safety and environmental protection an integral part of a productâs life cycle - from manufacture, marketing and distribution to use, recycling and disposal."

Historical production from Willow Creek is estimated at anywhere from 2,832 ounces of gold to as high as 10,000 ounces of gold. On the property, strong northeast trending faults can be seen intersecting strong north trending faults, one of which cuts through the Wadley Mine and continues south through Sections 14 and 24. These intersections projected down to the more favorable Comus Formation host rocks at depth and are our principal exploration targets. There is a large window into the lower plate Comus Formation on our property indicating Comus at depth. The Comus is intruded by a small plug of dacite porphyry with associated northeast trending dikes. The Comus limestones are black and sooty with carbon. Small amounts of quartz/limonite stockwork veining were evident and we believe this an excellent host rock. Geologic mapping, sampling and target definition is planned for late in 2005 for this new exploration project. Diamond Hill\nDiamond Hill is an underground gold mine and is located approximately 28 miles southeast of Helena, Montana, in Broadwater County and on the east flank of the Elkhorn Mountains, within the Hassel Mining District. Diamond Hill was in production from 1996 to 2000 when operations ceased. During that period, 775,000 tons of ore were mined at an average grade of 0.233 ounces of gold per ton. Diamond Hill covers over 2,590 acres of patented and unpatented claims. We have 100% ownership of the main patented claims that contain the current deposits, subject to a 0.5 to 1% net smelter return and a 10% net profits royalty. We also have 50% ownership of four additional patented claims, which are peripheral to the main land package. As of December 31, 2004, we hold 103 unpatented claims and lease 19 unpatented claims. The current mine permit covers 270 acres with most of the disturbance within a 27-acre area. The Diamond Hill orebodies and mine workings are in solid unfractured rock and accordingly are amenable to low cost sublevel open stoping methods.",
      "Geologic mapping suggests that the faults that host gold-silver mineralization may be more numerous and more continuous than earlier field work indicated. Petrographical examination revealed the presence of native gold, silver, and electrum in many samples and widespread vein features indicative of repeated boiling and explosive brecciation. Overall vein textures are consistent with high-level exposures of epithermal quartz-adularia and/or fault breccia veins. Throughout 2006, we expect to continue mapping, trenching, sampling and conducting geophysical studies on the property, including the selection of several primary targets for drill sites and the commencement of a drilling program.

      "The drilling program focused on testing the extent of gold mineralization below the Windfall and Rustler open pits, located approximately 3 miles northeast of the main Lookout Mountain project mineralization area. The Windfall project is one of several prospective gold projects on our extensive Eureka property in Nevada. Results from the surface mapping program, review of historic production and geologic maps, and drilling indicate that high-grade gold is locally controlled within cross structures cutting the main Windfall fault zone, at the contact between the Hamburg Dolomite and Dunderburg Shale. The 2009 drill program tested approximately 3,600 feet of the Windfall fault zone with wide spaced drilling. The Windfall fault zone is part of an extensive mineralized structural trend which extends for over 17,000 feet based on historic data. All holes in the 2009 exploration program encountered thick intercepts of low-grade gold (holes 5-12) or anomalous gold mineralization (holes 13 and 14) within the Windfall fault zone. The offset and exploration holes drilled define the Windfall fault zone as a 150 to 200-foot thick zone striking roughly north-south and dipping approximately 60 degrees to the east, containing two or more significant zones of mineralization. Five of the ten holes were drilled as offsets to follow up on the high-grade gold intercept drilled in hole 4 (75 feet at 0.153 ounces of gold/ton), and five were drilled as exploratory holes to test the strike and dip extent of the Windfall fault zone. Several thick intercepts of gold mineralization were returned, including 135 feet at 0.011 ounces of gold/ton in hole 7, 135 feet at 0.016 ounces of gold/ton in hole 8, 115 feet at 0.010 ounces of gold/ton in hole 9, and 100 feet at 0.018 ounces of gold/ton in hole 11. A secondary hanging wall structure identified by the mapping program was also encountered in drill holes 7, 8, 11, and 13 and is characterized by strong silicification and decalcification of Windfall Formation and Dunderberg shale in the hanging wall side of the fault, and Dunderberg shale and Hamburg Dolomite on the footwall side."

      "In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available, and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate. Thus, System reinforcement plans are subject to change, particularly with the restructuring of the electric utility industry. AEP forecasts $2.7 billion of construction expenditures for 2005. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. PROPOSED TRANSMISSION FACILITIES\nAPCo is proceeding with its plan to build the Jacksons Ferry-Wyoming 765,000-volt transmission line. The WVPSC and the VSCC have issued certificates authorizing construction and operation of the line. On December 31, 2002, the U.S. Forest Service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision to allow the use of federal lands in the Jefferson National Forest for construction of a portion of the line. On May 11, 2004, the decision of the Forest Service was challenged by the Sierra Club in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. APCo has intervened in that litigation. Construction of the line is underway and the project is scheduled to be completed by June 2006. PROPOSED GENERATION FACILITY In conjunction with an environmental impact study issued in August 2004, in the third quarter of 2004 we announced plans to construct a synthetic-gas-fired plant or plants of approximately 1,000 MW of capacity in the next five to six years utilizing integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology. We estimate that this new plant or plants will cost in the range of $1.7 billion. We have not determined a location for the plant or plants, but it or they will be in one of our eastern states, because of ready access to coal. We are currently performing site analysis and evaluation and at the same time working with state regulators and legislators to establish a framework for expedient recovery of this significant investment in new clean coal technology before final site selection.",
      "We have filed with PJM for transmission analysis of sites in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. Our significant planned environmental investments in emission control installations at existing coal-fired plants and our commitment to IGCC technology reinforce our belief that coal will be a lower-emission domestic energy source of the future and further signals our commitment to investing in clean, environmentally safe technology. For additional information regarding anticipated environmental expenditures, see Managementâs Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under the heading entitled The Current Air Quality Regulatory Framework. CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES\nThe following table shows construction expenditures (including environmental expenditures) during 2002, 2003 and 2004 and current estimates of 2005 construction expenditures, in each case including AFUDC, but excluding assets acquired under leases.

At December 31, 1997, the estimated 1998, 1999 and 2000 expenditures for environmental air and water emission control facilities were $57.9 million, $24.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively (see Item 7. Management's Discussion and analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Competition\nIndustry Outlook\nUnprecedented change is continuing to occur in the electric utility industry nationwide, furthering the development of a competitive environment. In general, the economics of the electric generation business have fundamentally changed with open transmission access and the increased availability of electric supply alternatives. Such alternatives will likely serve to lower customer prices, particularly in areas where only higher cost energy is currently provided."

      "FREIT assesses and measures segment operating results based on net operating income (\"NOI\"). NOI is based on operating revenue and expenses directly associated with the operations of the real estate properties, but excludes deferred rents (straight lining), depreciation, financing costs and amortization of acquired lease values. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Continuing real estate rental revenue, operating expenses, NOI and recurring capital improvements for the reportable segments are summarized below and reconciled to consolidated net income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2008. Asset information is not reported since FREIT does not use this measure to assess performance. Note 14- Discontinued operations: On June 26, 2007, FREIT closed on its contract for the sale of the Lakewood Apartments in Lakewood, New Jersey and recognized a gain of approximately $3.7 million from the sale. In compliance with current accounting guidance (SFAS No. 144 - âAccounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assetsâ), the gain on the sale, as well as earnings of the Lakewood operation, are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying income statements, and prior periodsâ income statements have been reclassified. Revenue attributable to discontinued operations was $268,000 and $412,000 for Fiscal 2007and 2006, respectively.

      "FREITâs total capital commitments represent obligations under its mortgage loan and construction contracts as follows:\nShare repurchase program: On April 9, 2008, FREITâs Board of Trustees authorized up to $2 million for the repurchase of FREIT shares commencing three (3) days after the announcement of its operating results for the quarter ended April 30, 2008. Share repurchases under this program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on trading prices of FREIT shares and other market conditions. This share repurchase program may be limited or terminated atany time and without prior notice. As of October 31, 2008, FREIT repurchased 46,720 shares of common stock at a cost of $1,075,000, which is reflected in the Stockholdersâ Equity section of FREITâs balance sheet. Funds From Operations (âFFOâ) Many consider FFO as the standard measurement of a REITâs performance. We compute FFO as follows:\nFFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and therefore should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure of results of operations or for cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, the application and calculation of FFO by certain other REITs may vary materially from that of FREITâs, and therefore FREITâs FFO and the FFO of other REITs may not be directly comparable. Distributions to Shareholders\nSince its inception in 1961, FREIT has elected to be treated as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of highly technical and complex operational requirements including that we must distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. We anticipate making distributions to shareholders from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase from future growth in rental revenues. Although cash used to make distributions reduces amounts available for capital investment, we generally intend to distribute not less than the minimum of REIT taxable income necessary to satisfy the applicable REIT requirement as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.",
      "When FREIT determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may be impaired, the measurement of any impairment is based on a projected discounted cash flow method determined by FREIT's management. While we believe that our discounted cash flow methods are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows may significantly affect the measurement of impairment. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 144, \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" SFAS No. 144 requires the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale. FREIT has adopted SFAS No. 144. During 2007, FREIT sold its Lakewood, NJ property. FREIT has reclassified the net income (loss) from the operation of this property as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have an impact on net income, but only impacted the presentation of this property within the consolidated statements of income. The results of this reclassification can be seen in \"Item 6 Selected Financial Data\" above and in the Consolidated Financial Statements of FREIT (including related notes thereto) appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSince we consider net income from continuing operations to be the most significant element of net income, all references and comparisons refer to this item unless otherwise stated. All references to per share amounts are on a diluted basis (unless otherwise indicated), and refer to earnings per share from continuing operations and have been adjusted to reflect the one-for-one share dividends paid in October 2001 and March 2004. Results of Operations:\nFiscal Years Ended October 31, 2008 and 2007\nSummary revenues and net income for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2008 (âFiscal 2008â) and October 31, 2007 (âFiscal 2007â) are as follows:\nRevenue for Fiscal 2008 increased 3.9% to $42,340,000 compared to $40,738,000 for Fiscal 2007.",

The Postle field, located in Texas County, Oklahoma, includes five producing units and one producing lease covering a total of approximately 25,600 gross (24,200 net) acres. Four of the units are currently active CO2 enhanced recovery projects. Our expansion of the CO2 flood at the Postle field continues to generate positive results. As of December 31, 2009, we were injecting 140 MMcf/d of CO2 in this field. Production from the field has increased 30% from a net 7.1 MBOE/d in December 2008 to a net 9.2 MBOE/d in December 2009. Operations are underway to expand CO2 injection into the northern part of the fourth unit, HMU, and to optimize flood patterns in the existing CO2 floods. These expansion projects include the restoration of shut-in wells and the drilling of new producing and injection wells. In the Postle field, the estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2009 were 78% PDP, 4% PDNP and 18% PUD. We are the sole owner of the Dry Trails Gas Plant located in the Postle field. This gas processing plant utilizes a membrane technology to separate CO2 gas from the produced wellhead mixture of hydrocarbon and CO2 gas so that the CO2 gas can be re-injected into the producing formation.

As of February 1, 2012, we were injecting approximately 120 MMcf/d of CO2 in this field, over half of which is recycled gas. We manage our CO2 flood at Postle on a pattern-by-pattern basis in order to optimize utilization of CO2, production and ultimate recovery. A pattern typically consists of a producing well surrounded by four water/CO2 injectors. As a pattern matures, increasing volumes of water are alternated with CO2 injection to control gas breakthrough and sweep efficiency.

      "In April 2004, we were granted the first of these two-year extensions, through April 2007. In connection with this extension, we agreed to an additional work program commitment of $30.5 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had satisfied these capital expenditure commitments. Pursuant to the exploration contract, we can produce wells under a test program, provided we make 2% royalty payments (based on production) to the Kazakhstan government. We intend to apply for the next two-year extension to continue the exploration of the license area and expand the South Alibek Field before the existing exploration contract term expires. Production Contract\nUnder our exploration contract and the Law of Petroleum, we hold the exclusive right to negotiate and execute a production contract with the MEMR in the event of a commercial discovery in the license area, and the government is required to conduct these negotiations. In December 2004, the State Committee on Reserves (âSCRâ) approved commercial reserves for development and exploitation in the South Alibek Field. On this basis, the MEMR granted us the exclusive right to execute a long-term production contract in June 2005. We concluded negotiations of the final commercial and legal terms of the contract in September 2005, when the working group of the MEMR formally approved the draft production contract. The final draft was then circulated to the relevant governmental ministries and committees for their formal acceptance prior to contract execution. In the course of this process, several of these governmental bodies requested additional changes to the contract, most of which we successfully negotiated and included in the written contract. As of March 10, 2006, approval of one remaining government ministry was still pending. Once this final approval is obtained, the production contract will be signed by the prime minister, at which time it will enter into\neffect. We believe that this approval will be obtained and the production contract signed during the first half of 2006.",
      "Item 2. Properties\nUnder the statutory scheme in the Republic of Kazakhstan prospective oil fields are developed in two stages. The first stage is an exploration and appraisal stage during which a private contractor is given a license to explore for oil and gas on a territory for a set term of years. During this stage the primary focus is on the search for a commercial discovery, i.e., a discovery of a sufficient quantity of oil and gas to make it commercially feasible to pursue execution of, or transition to, a commercial production contract with the government. Under the terms of an exploration contract the contract holder has the right to sell all oil and natural gas produced during the term of the exploration contract. We currently own a 100% interest in a license to use subsurface mineral resources and a hydrocarbon exploration contract issued by the ROK in 1999 and 2000, respectively (collectively referred to herein as the (âlicenseâ or the âexploration contractâ). When initially granted, the exploration and development stage of our exploration contract had a five year term, with provision for two extensions for a period of two years each. On June 24, 2008 the MEMR agreed to extend the exploration stage of our exploration contract until January 2013. Initially, the exploration contract granted us the right to engage in exploration and development activities in an area of approximately 200 square kilometers referred to herein as the âADE Block.â The ADE Block is comprised of three fields, the Aksaz, Dolinnoe and Emir fields. During our 2006 fiscal year our exploration contract was expanded to include an additional 260 square kilometers of land adjacent to the ADE Block, which we refer to herein as the âSoutheast Blockâ, which includes the Kariman oil and gas field and the Borly and Yessen structures. In October 2008 the MEMR granted a further extension of the territory covered under our exploration contract to include an additional 390 square kilometer area, bring our total contract area to 850 square kilometers (approximately 210,114 acres).",

The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels. Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five years with the possibility of two-year extensions. The production period is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. Kazakhstan\nOnshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993. Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions. Malaysia\nProduction activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have terms ranging up to 29 years. All extensions are subject to the national oil companyâs prior written approval. The total production period is 15 to 29 years, depending on the date of the execution of the contract and the date of first commercial lifting. Qatar\nThe State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects."

      "On May 19, 1995, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 955,864 Common Shares relating to Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-II Partnership units and up to 310,000 Common Shares issued in one of SCI's prior private placement offerings; such registration statement was declared effective on June 26, 1995. Through December 31, 1997, limited partners had exchanged 555,654 of their Partnership units in SCI Limited Partnership-II for 555,651 Common Shares (and cash payments for partial units). As a result of these conversions and additional capital contributions by SCI, SCI's general partnership interest increased from 81.2% to 97.6% and 90,213 limited partnership units remain outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-II. Limited partners are also entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, SCI as general partner is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale. SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV\nOn October 28, 1994, SCI acquired $91.7 million of additional properties and related assets through two Partnerships, SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV.",
      "SCI Limited Partnership-IV contained approximately $81 million of properties and related assets at December 31, 1997, and is structured as a distinct entity to maintain the credit rating of the secured notes assumed by such Partnership. A total of 583,512 limited partnership units were issued by these two Partnerships to certain previously unaffiliated parties. SCI contributed $35.4 million of cash to these Partnerships in 1994 to retire debt, pay part of the aggregate property purchase price, make capital improvements and pay closing costs. $47.1 million of mortgage debt was assumed by these\nPartnerships. During 1995, SCI contributed an additional $11.9 million to SCI Limited Partnership-III for property acquisitions which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 50.4% to 71.8%. In 1996, SCI contributed $4.2 million to SCI Limited Partnership III in connection with property acquisition. In the aggregate, these contributions increased SCI's general partnership interest from 71.8% to 75.6%. On October 23, 1997, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 583,508 Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV units. The registration statement was declared effective on November 6, 1997. In the fourth quarter of 1997, 105,000 partnership units were converted to 105,000 SCI Common Shares, bringing SCI's general partnership interest to 80.6% at December 31, 1997. During 1996 and 1997, SCI contributed $2.5 million to SCI Limited Partnership IV in connection with tax deferred exchanges of real estate which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 96.36% to 96.65% at December 31, 1997. There were 409,900 and 68,612 partnership units outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV, respectively, at December 31, 1997. The Partnership agreements for these Partnerships are substantially similar to the Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II and permit holders of limited partnership units to exchange each unit for a Common Share beginning on October 29, 1995.",
      "SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, has complete discretion and control with respect to all management matters, including disposition of assets, except for certain restrictions on the retirement of assumed debt. Limited partners are entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a limited partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner. In the event that the Partnerships sell any of their respective properties, SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale, except (during the first 10 years of the Partnerships only) to the extent of unpaid distributions and interest thereon. SCI DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\nSCI Development Services Incorporated (\"SCI Development Services\") was incorporated in Delaware in August 1994 for the purpose of acquiring, developing, operating, and selling distribution space facilities either for its own account or for third parties. SCI owns 100% of the nonvoting preferred stock of SCI Development Services and an unaffiliated third party owns 100% of the voting common stock and, as a result, SCI has no control over the operations of SCI Development Services.",
      "Additionally, the limited partners are entitled to receive fully cumulative quarterly distributions per Partnership unit equal to the quarterly distributions payable in respect of Common Shares. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, limited partners are entitled to a pro rata distribution of the net proceeds of such sale, with a corresponding downward adjustment in the number of Common Shares for which a unit may be exchanged. Each limited partner has agreed that, from and after the time that such limited partner has exercised its right to exchange a Partnership unit for a Common Share and for a period of four years after the date of the Partnership agreement, the limited partner will not, during any calendar year, sell Common Shares owned by the limited partner if such sale would exceed 33% of the aggregate number of Partnership units and Common Shares outstanding on the date of the Partnership agreement. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner. SCI Limited Partnership-II\nIn exchange for approximately 645,867 Partnership units, the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II contributed the following properties: (i) 437,542 square feet of industrial property in SCI's Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas target market; (ii) 217,504 square feet in SCI's Austin, Texas target market; (iii) 132,605 square feet in SCI's San Francisco (East Bay Area), California target market; (iv) 51,750 square feet in SCI's Denver, Colorado target market; (v) 493,894 square feet in SCI's Charlotte, North Carolina target market; and (vi) 270,000 square feet in SCI's El Paso, Texas target market. The foregoing properties had an aggregate purchase price to SCI of $45.5 million. None of the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II is affiliated with SCI. The Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II granted to limited partners the right to exchange each Partnership unit for a Common Share beginning on February 15, 1995.",
      "Distributions by the Operating Partnership with respect to Preferred Units and Common Units provide the funds to enable the Company to make distributions to the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock. The partnership agreement also provides that, after the June 30 or December 31 next succeeding the first anniversary of any issuance of Common Units (or earlier in the event of certain extraordinary transactions), each holder of Common Units other than the Company will have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem its Common Units at a per unit redemption price equal to the then market value of a share of Common Stock. Such redemption will be in cash, except that the Company may assume the redemption obligation and pay the redemption in form of shares of its Common Stock. During 1999, approximately 297,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately 297,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During 1998, approximately 41,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately $596,000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for issuance upon the potential redemption of approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 partnership units, respectively. UNISSUED REGISTERED SECURITIES: At December 31, 1999, the Company had registered for issuance an aggregate of $202,144,000 of unissued securities under various shelf registration statements. 9. PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK\nMARKET QUOTATIONS\nMarket quotations are from the New York Stock Exchange. At December 31, 1999, there were 2,156 holders of record of the Company's shares. 10. STOCK OPTIONS The Company has a stock option and incentive plan which expires in 2006 and is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A maximum of 2,950,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options or other stock-based awards that may be granted under the plan."

      "A FERC approved plan, prepared in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was implemented to remediate the PCBs in the plant. As a condition of its approval of the license amendment for the overhaul project, FERC required Chugach to also investigate the presence of PCBs in Kenai Lake. A sampling plan was developed by Chugach in consultation with state and federal agencies and approved by FERC. In 2000, Chugach sampled sediments and fish collected from Kenai Lake and other waters. While low levels of PCBs were found in some sediment samples taken near the plant, no pathway from sediment to fish was established. While the levels of PCBs in fish from Kenai Lake were similar to levels found in fish from other lakes within the region, Chugach conducted additional sampling and analysis of fish in Kenai Lake and other waters and filed Chugach's final report dated April 1, 2002, with FERC, which analyzed the results of the sampling. Based on these analyses, Chugach concluded that no further PCB sampling and analysis in Kenai Lake was necessary. In a letter dated June 13, 2002, FERC informed Chugach that its review of the report supported Chugach's conclusions and agreed Chugach was not required to conduct further PCB sampling and analysis in Kenai Lake. In its recent order in Chugach's general rate case, Order U-01-108(26), the RCA permitted the costs associated with the overhaul and the PCB remediation to be recovered through rates. Consequently, management believes the costs of the PCB remediation and studies will have no material impact on Chugach's financial condition or results of operations. Item 3",
      "The complaints allege that BGE arranged for its fly ash to be deposited on the site. Settlement discussions continue among all parties. Additional investigation was initiated on the remainder of the site by the MDE for the EPA but was never completed. BGE and three other defendants agreed to complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study of groundwater contamination around the site in a July 1993 consent order. The remedial action, if any, for the remainder of the site will not be selected until these investigations are concluded. Therefore, neither the total site cleanup costs, nor BGE's share, can presently be estimated. In the early 1970's, BGE shipped an unknown number of scrapped transformers to Metal Bank of America, a metal reclaimer in Philadelphia. Metal Bank's scrap and storage yard has been found to be contaminated with oil containing high levels of PCBs (PCBs are hazardous chemicals frequently used as a fire-resistant coolant in electrical equipment). On December 7, 1987, the EPA notified BGE and nine other utilities that they are considered potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the cleanup of the site. A remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) by BGE and the other PRPs was submitted to the EPA on October 14, 1994. Estimated costs for the various remedies included in the RI/FS range greatly (from $15 million to $45 million). Until a specific remedy is chosen, BGE is not able to predict the actual cleanup costs. BGE's share of the cleanup costs, estimated to be approximately 15.79%, could be material. From 1985 until 1989, BGE shipped waste oil and other materials to the Industrial Solvents and Chemical Company in York County, Pennsylvania for disposal. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (Pennsylvania Department) subsequently investigated this site and found it to be heavily contaminated by hazardous wastes. The Pennsylvania Department notified BGE on August 15, 1990, that it and approximately 1,000 other entities were PRPs with respect to the cost of all remedial activities to be conducted at the site.",
      "This task was completed in August of 2009. The RSA also required Chugach to design, permit, and construct a winter access parking area. This project was completed in September of 2009. The most significant requirement of the RSA requires Chugach to establish a flow regime in Cooper Creek below the Cooper Lake Dam. This is a complex project that includes a Stetson Creek Diversion (Dam), Pipeline (Conveyance System) and Cooper Lake Outlet Works. In short, it is designed to remove colder water flowing into Cooper Creek drainage and replace it with warmer Cooper Lake water, possibly improving fish habitat. Our consultants have completed extensive geotechnical feasibility work over the last two years and recently issued a âDraftâ Basis of Design Report. The next step is to complete the final design package to submit to FERC. Chugach was successful in obtaining a two year extension on this deliverable, which is now due in August of 2012. Cooper Lake Unit 2 was taken out of service in August of 2008 to perform repairs and major maintenance. The unit was put back into service in May of 2009. Unit 1 was taken out of service in May of 2009, shortly after the return to service of Unit 2, to perform repairs and major maintenance, and returned back into service in February of 2010. Both units were in service or standby since February of 2010. In 1997, we acquired a 30 percent interest in the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project. The plant is located on federal land pursuant to a United States Bureau of Land Management right-of-way grant issued in October 1997. MEA owns 17 percent of the project and AML&P owns the remaining 53 percent undivided interest and performs maintenance on the units as needed. Our principal generation units are Beluga 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. These units have a combined capacity of 345.8 MW and meet most of our load. All other units are used principally as reserve. While the Beluga turbine-generators have been in service for many years, they have been maintained in good working order with scheduled inspections and periodic upgrades.",
      "Sampling of drill core prior to 2004 by Kennecott and BCMC focused primarily on the mineralized zones. During the 1998 campaign, Kennecott did sample some broad zones of alteration and weak mineralization, but much of the unaltered and unmineralized rock remains unsampled. ALS Chemex was also used for analyses conducted by Kennecott. Earlier BCMC sampling was even more restricted to mineralized zones of core. Intervals of visible sulfide mineralization were selected for sampling and analyses were conducted by Union Assay Office Inc. of Salt Lake City, Utah. Numerous intervals of weak to moderate mineralization remain unsampled in the historic drill care. NovaGold conducted some limited sampling of this historical drill core to gain a better understanding of trace element distribution around the Arctic deposit. During the relogging of much of this historical core, 1m intervals were selected over each 10m of unmineralized core. These 1m intervals were sawn in half, with one-half returned to the box and the other half placed in a bag, labeled and sent to the laboratory for analysis. This type of sampling was used to determine trace element distribution about the deposit; none of the mineralized zones were sampled in this way. With the lack of outcrop in a folded metamorphic terrane, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the geologic model to predict positioning of the drill to get a sample of true thickness in the mineralized zone. NovaGold diligently relogged core and mapped the project, and we have been diligently relogging core and mapping the project to gain this understanding. The use of oriented core is very important to this interpretation. SRK has confidence that the samples collected at the Arctic Project are representative of the geometry of the mineralized zone. Arctic Project - Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security\nThe core from the NovaGold programs was sawn in half, with half sent to labs in Fairbanks, AK for sample preparation and the other half returned to the core box for storage.",
      "We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when those costs are probable and reasonably estimated. We do not anticipate that environmental related expenditures will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot, however, predict the nature, extent or cost of new laws or regulations relating to environmental matters. The three utility owners of the Eklutna Hydro Project (Chugach, ML&P, and MEA) are obligated by a 1991 Fish & Wildlife Agreement to develop and implement measures to protect, mitigate, and enhance the fish and wildlife impacted by the project (PME program). The program is to be approved by the Governor of Alaska with completion of the program no later than October of 2032, 35 years after its purchase. The owners initiated a required consultation process with key\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngovernment agencies and interested parties in March 2019. The agreement requires equal consideration of; 1) efficient and economical power production, 2) energy conservation, 3) protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife, 4) protection of recreation opportunities, 5) municipal water supplies, 6) preservation of other aspects of environmental quality, 7) other beneficial public uses, and 8) requirements of state law. The hydro project and municipal water system currently utilize 100% of the water inflows. The Clean Air Act and Environmental Protection Agency (âEPAâ) regulations under the Clean Air Act establish ambient air quality standards and limit the emission of many air pollutants. New Clean Air Act regulations impacting electric utilities may result from future events or new regulatory programs. An Executive Order promoting energy independence and economic growth was issued on March 28, 2017, by the President instructing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan (âCPPâ). On August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (âACEâ) rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants."

      "U.S. Investors should read the \"Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates\" above concerning the difference between \"resources\" and \"reserves\". An NI 43-101 preliminary assessment was prepared for Vista Gold, by Gustavson under the direction of John W. Rozelle, P.G., an independent Qualified Person. The study is titled \"Preliminary Economic Assessment, Mt. Todd Gold Project, Northern Territory, Australia\" and is dated December 29, 2006. It was posted on SEDAR on January 4, 2007. In undertaking the preliminary assessment, Gustavson considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of the mineralized material by open-pit mining. The study included a conceptual process flowsheet developed by Resource Development Inc. of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, which is based on preliminary testwork and includes a flotation circuit to recover a bulk sulfide concentrate, and further flotation to separate a copper sulfide concentrate that would contain about one-half of the gold and which would be shipped to a smelter. A pyrite concentrate containing about one-half of the gold would also be produced and this concentrate would be cyanide leached to recover the gold. The cyanide in the sulfide residue would be neutralized, following which the residue would be filtered to dry it, and then placed on a lined pad. MWH Australia Pty Ltd (\"MWH\") designed conceptual tailing disposal facilities, including utilizing the existing tailing facility, and estimated capital costs for these facilities. MWH also completed a closure study and cost estimate for closing the mine and facilities following resumption of production. In the preliminary assessment, Gustavson assumed a 33,000 ton-per-day (11.7 million tons-per-year) ore production rate, resulting in a ten-year operating life. Overall gold recovery was estimated at 87% and copper recovery at 70%. The cost estimates used in the preparation of a preliminary assessment are generally accepted as being within plus or minus 35-40% of what might be incurred in actual construction and operations.",
      "Gustavson was commissioned in June 2007 to complete a preliminary assessment for Vista Gold of the project under NI 43-101 standards. The study was completed on January 16, 2008, under the direction of John Rozelle, an independent Qualified Person. The report is titled \"Preliminary Assessment, Awak Mas Gold Project, Sulawesi, Indonesia\" and is dated January 16, 2008. It is available on SEDAR. In undertaking the preliminary assessment, Gustavson considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of the mineralized material (mineral resources under Canadian guidelines) by open-pit mining. The study included a process flowsheet based on three stages of laboratory and pilot plant test programs from 1994 to 1997. The flowsheet was developed by Minproc Engineers Ltd. in 1997, and reviewed and approved by Resource Development Inc. of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, for this study. The flowsheet includes a flotation circuit to recover gold associated with sulfide minerals following which the concentrate would be treated in a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. The benign tailings from the flotation circuit would flow by gravity into a tailings impoundment and the sulfide tailings would be detoxified, filtered and conveyed to a small \"dry-stack\" sulfide tailings storage facility. MWH Americas Inc. of Denver and Steamboat Springs, Colorado, prepared the tailings\ndisposal sites layout and closure plans, and assessed permitting requirements. The potential development included four different scenarios that would produce an estimated 0.6 to 1.0 million ounces of gold over a project life of 7 to 15 years. Gustavson estimated the preproduction capital to be $124 million to $178 million, depending on the scenario, and the total capital cost over the project life to be $148 million to $218 million. The cost estimates used in the preparation of a preliminary assessment are generally accepted as being within plus or minus 35 to 40% of what might be incurred in actual construction and operations.",

      "Based on our review of the historic project files, we believe that approximately 24.6 million tonnes grading 1.06 grams gold per tonne and containing 826,000 ounces of gold were extracted between 1996 and the termination of mining in 2000. Processing was by a combination of heap leach production from oxide ore and cyanidation of sulfide ore.

      "Prior to the assignment, all work and expenditures relating to the Comoe property in furtherance of the Comoe Agreement had already been supervised and funded through PARC. Work Program\nDuring 1997, PARC spent approximately $890,000 on continued exploration over four of the Comoe permits with the best results from and emphasis placed on the Tanda permit in the northeast of the Comoe property. Work completed on the Tanda permit included a reinterpretation of prior airborne geophysical surveys, 240 kilometres of soil traverses, detailed geologic mapping, 53 auger holes totaling approximately 209 metres and 820 channel samples. The work on the Tanda permit identified over 20 distinct semi-continuous zones of anomalous gold mineralization over an area 10 kilometres long, close to the faulted contact between Birimian metavolcanic rocks and Tarkwain sediments. Mineralization appears to be associated with low angle thrust sheets that separate the sediments from the metavolcanics. Soil sampling identified 20 anomalies along the zones (>100 metres, > 100 ppb Au) with intervals up to 0.73 g Au/t over 670 metres. On a road cut near the village of Assafou, channel sampling was conducted over 820 metres across an outcrop of what appears to be silicified quartz veined Tarkwain sediments. The majority of the deep road cut proved anomalous with one interval of 210 metres exhibiting a weighted average grade of approximately 1.1 g Au/t.\nA budget of approximately $275,000 has been proposed for work on the Tanda permit during the first six months of 1998. The work will focus on better defining and further delineating zones of gold mineralization near the village of Assafou with its anomalous road cut and inferred thrust zones. Proposed work includes further detailed mapping, ground geophysical surveys, detailed soil sampling, augering and rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. The Company is also seeking a partnership arrangement to fund exploration at the project.\nNDORI, KENYA\nKenya is a former British colony which gained independence in 1963.",
      "Prior to the assignment, all work and expenditures relating to the Comoe property in furtherance of the Comoe Agreement had already been supervised and funded through PARC. The Property\nThe center of the Comoe property is located approximately 240 km due north of Abidjan, the principal city in Ivory Coast. The Comoe property is for the most part underlain by Lower Proterozoic Birimian volcano-sedimentary formations of the West African Shield. The central portion of the property is inferred to be underlain predominately by metasedimentary formations. Basic to intermediate volcanics with overlying probably Tarkwan sediments occur within the northeast corner of the property. Granite intrusives occur as small plutons within the central portion of the permit area. Due to limited outcrop, the property is relatively unexplored. Work by SODEMI, a mining company owned by the Republic of Ivory Coast, has confirmed the location of some old artisan gold workings, indicating the possibility of gold source rocks within the permit area. Work Program\nDuring 1996, follow-up geochemical evaluation of selected gold targets on the Kregbe, Padanian, Tanda and Koutoukounou permits was initiated. A total of 6,641 soil samples, 364 termite mound samples and 251 rock samples were collected and analyzed and 38 old artisanal mining sites were visited. The most prospective anomalies on the Kregbe permit were tested with rotary air blast (\"RAB\") drilling to a depth of 25 to 30 m. A total of 2,764 m were drilled in 116 holes on 50 m centers. Follow-up ground magnetic surveys were completed over potentially diamond bearing, pipelike structures identified during the 1995 airborne geophysical survey on the Amoriakro, Aougnanou, Dihezue, Klebo, Ouakabessi, Sirakoro and Tetessi permits. Pitting was conducted over the more prospective areas of the magnetic anomalies to provide large samples of in situ rock for mineral analysis. During 1996, the Company spent $1.1 million exploring the Comoe property. The work program for 1997 is anticipated to involve continued geochemical and geological sampling of additional targets identified during the 1995 reconnaissance exploration program.",
      "This work identified additional area of anomalous gold values on the on the border of the Fougala and AFC permits. During 1996, the Company spent $0.8 million on exploration at the Dioulafoundou project. The work program for 1997 to be conducted by ASM is anticipated to involve induced polarization (\"IP\") geophysical surveys to assist in better defining potential gold bearing structures. Additional geochemistry, including termite mound sampling, will be completed. Based upon results of this work, it is anticipated that ASM will conduct a core and RC drilling program to continue the evaluation of the property during 1997. MELGUE\nPARC entered into a mineral agreement dated October 18, 1995 (the \"Melgue Mineral Agreement\") with the Government of Mali represented by the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Hydrology for the Melgue property. The Melgue Mineral Agreement has a term of up to 30 years and provides for the issuance of an exploration permit for a 220 km(2) area of the Melgue property and, if applicable, the issuance of further mining permits for the development and exploitation of the property. The exploration permit covering the Melgue property was granted to PARC on December 11, 1995, for a period of three years. PARC has committed to spend at least $680,000 in connection with the Melgue property during the first 24 months following the grant of the exploration permit on December 11, 1995. A three-phase initial work program is planned, with the first phase to be completed within one year at a minimum expenditure of $180,000. Estimated work expenditures for the second and third phases are $0.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The Property\nThe Melgue property is located approximately 60 km north of the regional centre of Kayes in western Mali. The project area is just west of the village of Aourou, which is about a 4 to 5 hour drive from Kayes in a 4-wheel drive vehicle. The permit area is flat with sparse vegetation as it is on the edge of the Sahara desert. Very high temperatures during both day and night are common in the period from February to April making field work difficult.",
      "Work Program\nThe main objective of the exploration conducted to date has been to evaluate the entire 1,800 km(2) concession area. During 1996, continued work in the western part of the property (Dul Mountain, Azale and Ashashire) indicated low potential for defining economically attractive, bulk minable gold deposits and further evaluation ceased. At the Balaute prospect, additional trenching failed to identify gold mineralization below two principal surface anomalies and no further work was undertaken. Following the completion of work at Dul Mountain, Azale, Ashashire and Belaute, PARC's exploration camp was moved to the eastern half of the concession area near the Menghi prospect. An intensive work program was undertaken at Menghi in an area where extensive artisanal gold mining was being conducted. Following soil sampling and a ground magnetics geophysical survey, trenching was conducted on the principal target at Menghi, a north striking, quartz ridge approximately 600 m long which exhibited strong shearing, alteration and well developed sulfides over from 20 to 40 m with gold mineralization hosted by diorite intrusives in the south and granite in the north. Sixteen trenches were excavated along the strike length of the zone, totaling approximately 555 m, with good results. A 10 hole core drilling program, totaling 1,372 m, was completed to test the potential depth extension of gold mineralization identified in the trenches. Despite the indication of wide zones of economic mineralization in trenches, the core drilling at Menghi failed to replicate economic widths at depth with only narrow quartz veins being intersected. No further work is planned at Menghi. Some potential still exists in the far eastern part of the Dul Mountain property. This is demonstrated by results from stream sediment geochemistry. The Company is following-up with soil sampling, a program which is still ongoing and will likely not be completed in the current second permit year. The Company intends to relinquish approximately 75% of the concession area, but maintain the balance in the eastern portion so the evaluation of these targets can be completed in the third permit year."

Fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatt-hour sales. The factor is adjusted quarterly and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs. Over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers when new quarterly factors are established. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2004 Annual Reports, for information regarding current rate proceedings.

Cost Recovery Mechanisms\nPSCo\nAt December 31, 1997, PSCo has four adjustment clauses: the ICA (which replaced the ECA in 1996), GCA, DSMCA and QFCCA. These adjustment clauses allow certain costs to be passed through to retail customers. PSCo is required to file applications with the CPUC for approval of adjustment mechanisms in advance of the proposed effective date. The applications must be acted upon before becoming effective. The CPUC decision on the Merger modified and replaced the ECA with the ICA. The ICA, which became effective October 1, 1996, allows for a 50%/50% sharing of certain fuel and energy cost increases and decreases among customers and shareholders. PSCo, through its GCA, is allowed to recover the difference between its actual costs of purchased gas and the amount of these costs recovered under its base rates.

      "In May 2002, AEP announced an agreement with PJM to pursue terms for its east zone public utility subsidiaries to participate in PJM, a FERC-approved RTO. The AEP East Companies integrated into PJM on October 1, 2004.\nSWEPCo and PSO currently intend to transfer functional control of their transmission assets to SPP subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals. In February 2004, the FERC conditionally approved SPP as an RTO. In October 2004, the FERC issued an order granting RTO status to SPP subject to certain filings. The Arkansas Public Service Commission and LPSC have required filings related to SWEPCoâs transfer of functional control of transmission facilities to an RTO. The remaining west zone public utility subsidiaries (TCC and TNC) are members of ERCOT. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2004 Annual Reports and Managementâs Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under the heading entitled RTO Formation for a discussion of public utility subsidiary participation in RTOs. Regional Through and Out Rates\nIn July 2003, the FERC issued an order directing PJM and the MISO to make compliance filings for their respective OATTs to eliminate the transaction-based charges for through and out (T&O) transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed Midwest ISO and PJM expanded regions (Combined Footprint). The elimination of the T&O rates will reduce the transmission service revenues collected by the RTOs and thereby reduce the revenues received by transmission owners under the RTOsâ revenue distribution protocols. AEP and several other utilities in the Combined Footprint filed a proposal for new rates to become effective December 1, 2004. In November 2004, FERC eliminated the T&O rates and replaced the rates temporarily through March 2006 with a seams elimination cost adjustment (SECA) fees. AEPâs East zone public utility subsidiaries received approximately $196 million of T&O rate revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2004, the last twelve months prior to joining PJM."

      "In 1999, GeoCam was granted an Exploration Permit, PDR 67, on an area of 4,876 square kilometers. A Mining Convention was entered into between GeoCam and the Republic of Cameroon in 2002. In 2003, Mine Permit 33 was issued by decree granting an exclusive right to Geovic to exploit the deposits within the permitted area. Geovicâs program was initially based entirely on manually-dug test pits, and later incorporated drilling and limited trenching. The program began at Nkamouna and was later extended to the other Plateaus, which were identified by satellite images and air photos. Geologists from the Cameroon Ministry of Mines, Water and Energy participated in the work initially to provide government oversight as well as training. Lands held within the Mining Permit are designated âmultiple-use,â with the principal mineralized areas set aside for âexclusive mineâ development. Mining Permit lands were specifically established to exclude village lands in order to avoid conflicts with local communities. Specific sites that will be impacted by mining and mine related activities will be leased under a government prescribed expropriation process and will have âsite specificâ environmental plans designed and approved by governing agencies prior to mining. This inventory, valuation and registration process requires local government approval, following a review of each site by district leaders. The principal remaining permits required by GeoCam before the initiation of construction at Nkamouna include:\n1) Land Lease for development sites. 2) Water Use Permit. The land lease will be registered and issued to GeoCam. GeoCam will pay for the cost of leasing the land and compensation for the loss of alternative resources. GeoCam will have the right to occupy, build roads, remove vegetation and mine and process cobalt, nickel and associated substances covered in the Mining Convention once the land is leased, in accordance to the GeoCam Mining Convention of August 1, 2002. The Mine Permit area is totally contained in areas zoned for logging concessions and âmultiple use.â"

The well-defined base of higher grade mineralization from about 700 to 750 feet in depth suggests a strong pressure-temperature control on gold deposition. Sinters and breccias parallel the paleosurface present at the time of mineralization.

Visible gold (0.5 mm) has been found within the stockwork portions of the boiling horizon. The gold mostly occurs as electrum along the fracture margins or within microscopic voids. A brassy color is imparted due to the high silver content. The average silver to gold ratio at Grassy Mountain is 2.5:1. Silicification occurs both pervasively as silica flooding and as cross-cutting veins, veinlets and stockworks. The silicified envelope has plan dimensions of 3000 feet (N-S) by 2500 feet (E-W). Silicification is surrounded by barren, relatively unaltered, clay-rich (20-40% montmorillonite), tuffaceous siltstone and arkose with minor disseminated diagenetic pyrite. Many of the sinters occur as sheets instead of mounds, which suggests that they may be related to vents along faults rather than point sources. Potassic alteration occurs as adularia flooding with destruction of biotite. The adularia is extremely fine-grained and is identified microscopically or by cobaltinitrite staining. Sulfate phases identified by XRD include jarosite and alunite in several mineralized samples. Clast-supported breccias contain sub-rounded to sub-angular sand to boulder-sized clasts of silicified arkose and siltstone in a jarosite-sericite clay matrix.",

Following the issuance of the final EIS, we expect that each agency will issue a Record of Decision and their respective formal permits and authorization. Required permits include, but are not limited to, a wetland 404 permit, a water discharge permit (MPDES), a power transmission line permit and further revisions to Hard Rock Operating Permit 150. We submitted a MPDES draft application to the MDEQ in the third quarter of 2005. The agencies had several comments for which we developed technical responses, submitted a supplemental application in late 2006 and completed additional work in January 2007.

      "The plaintiffs may have a claim to funds expended after August 29, 1991. This greatly reduces PSO's exposure since most of the remediation was completed prior to this date. In October, 1996, the plaintiffs appealed this ruling, and PSO is awaiting the outcome of this matter. SWEPCO Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site SWEPCO was notified by Mississippi Power in 1994 that it may be a PRP at a MGP site in Biloxi, Mississippi, which was formerly owned and operated by a predecessor of SWEPCO. Since then, SWEPCO has worked with Mississippi Power on both the investigation of the extent of contamination on the site as well as on the subsequent sampling of the site. The sampling results indicated contamination at the property as well as the possibility of contamination of an adjacent property. A risk assessment was submitted to the MDEQ, and the MDEQ requested that a future residential exposure scenario be evaluated for comparison with commercial and industrial exposure scenarios. However, Mississippi Power and SWEPCO do not believe that cleanup to a residential scenario is appropriate since this site has been industrial/commercial for more than 100 years, and Mississippi Power plans to continue this type of usage. Mississippi Power and SWEPCO also presented a report to the MDEQ demonstrating that the ground water on the site was not potable, further demonstrating that cleanup to residential standards is not necessary. The MDEQ has not agreed to a non-residential future land use scenario and has requested further testing. Following the additional testing and resolution of whether cleanup must meet a residential usage scenario or a commercial/industrial scenario, a feasibility study will be conducted to more definitively evaluate remedial strategies for the property. The feasibility study process will require public input prior to a final decision being made. At the present time, SWEPCO has not had any further substantive discussions with MDEQ regarding the ultimate resolution of this issue. Therefore, a final range of cleanup costs is not yet determinable.",
      "The complaints allege that BGE arranged for its fly ash to be deposited on the site. Settlement discussions continue among all parties. Additional investigation was initiated on the remainder of the site by the MDE for the EPA but was never completed. BGE and three other defendants agreed to complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study of groundwater contamination around the site in a July 1993 consent order. The remedial action, if any, for the remainder of the site will not be selected until these investigations are concluded. Therefore, neither the total site cleanup costs, nor BGE's share, can presently be estimated. In the early 1970's, BGE shipped an unknown number of scrapped transformers to Metal Bank of America, a metal reclaimer in Philadelphia. Metal Bank's scrap and storage yard has been found to be contaminated with oil containing high levels of PCBs (PCBs are hazardous chemicals frequently used as a fire-resistant coolant in electrical equipment). On December 7, 1987, the EPA notified BGE and nine other utilities that they are considered potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the cleanup of the site. A remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) by BGE and the other PRPs was submitted to the EPA on October 14, 1994. Estimated costs for the various remedies included in the RI/FS range greatly (from $15 million to $45 million). Until a specific remedy is chosen, BGE is not able to predict the actual cleanup costs. BGE's share of the cleanup costs, estimated to be approximately 15.79%, could be material. From 1985 until 1989, BGE shipped waste oil and other materials to the Industrial Solvents and Chemical Company in York County, Pennsylvania for disposal. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (Pennsylvania Department) subsequently investigated this site and found it to be heavily contaminated by hazardous wastes. The Pennsylvania Department notified BGE on August 15, 1990, that it and approximately 1,000 other entities were PRPs with respect to the cost of all remedial activities to be conducted at the site.",

Management does not expect disposition of any such pending environmental proceedings to have a material adverse effect on CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. PSO Sand Springs/Grandfield, Oklahoma Sites In 1989, PSO found some PCB contamination in a Sand Springs, Oklahoma PCB storage facility. The EPA-approved cleanup began in 1994. In 1996, the EPA filed a complaint against PSO alleging that PSO failed to comply with provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act. The complaint has three counts, two of which pertain to the Sand Springs facility and the third of which deals with a substation in Grandfield, Oklahoma. The EPA alleges improper disposal of PCBs at the Sand Springs site due to the length of time between discovery of the contamination and the actual cleanup at the site. The complaint at the Grandfield site alleges failure to date PCB articles at the site. The total proposed penalty for the three counts, which was accrued by PSO in 1996, was $479,000. PSO settled all claims in the suit in March, 1998. The settlement did not have a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's results of operations or financial condition. PSO Compass Industries Superfund Site PSO has received notice from the EPA that it is a PRP under CERCLA and may be required to share in the reimbursement of cleanup costs for the Compass Industries Superfund site which has been remediated. PSO has been named\ndefendant in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August 29, 1994, for reimbursement of the cleanup costs. PSO's degree of responsibility, if any, is believed to be insignificant, and management expects that PSO will have an opportunity to pay its share of costs and remove itself from the case. Accordingly, in 1995, PSO accrued $100,000 for this matter. On March 19, 1996, a district judge ruled in favor of the defendants and determined that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under CERCLA.",
      "SWEPCO has incurred approximately $200,000 to date for its portion of the cleanup of this site, and based on its preliminary estimates, anticipates that an additional $2 million may be incurred. Accordingly, SWEPCO has accrued $2 million for the cleanup of the site. SWEPCO Voda Petroleum Superfund Site In April 1996, SWEPCO received correspondence from the EPA notifying SWEPCO that it is a PRP to a cleanup action planned for the Voda Petroleum Superfund Site located in Clarksville, Texas. SWEPCO is conducting a records review to compile documentation relating to SWEPCO's past use of the Voda Petroleum site. The proposed cleanup of the site is estimated by the EPA to cost approximately $2 million and to take approximately twelve months to complete. An option for over 30 PRPs to conduct the cleanup in lieu of the EPA conducting the cleanup is under consideration. Any SWEPCO liability associated with this project is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. EMFs Research is ongoing whether exposure to EMFs may result in adverse health effects. Although earlier studies suggested a correlation between EMFs and some types of effects, the research to date has not established a cause-and-effect\nrelationship between EMFs and adverse health effects from electric lines. Recently, more comprehensive studies have failed to show any correlation. CSW cannot predict the impact on CSW or the electric utility industry if further investigations or proceedings were to establish that the present electricity delivery system is contributing to increased risk or incidence of health problems.

As noted, tenants at the shopping centers include plant-on-premises dry cleaners. As a result of environmental site assessments conducted in the past few months, low levels of perchloroethylene have been detected in soils at the Company's Commonwealth, Fort Caroline and Eustis Square properties. The Company understands that the owners of these cleaners are applying to participate in the state-funded dry cleaner's program. In connection with the Company's acquisition of Skylake, a Phase two Environmental Site Assessment dated July 15, 1997 has revealed the existence of perchloroethylene at levels above regulatory limits caused by a dry cleaning business operated on the premises. The Company has learned that the site is included in the Florida Dry Cleaners State Program, and as a condition to the Company's purchase of the property, the seller agreed to pay all remediation costs, which environmental consultants have estimated to be approximately $250,000. The seller placed $500,000 into an escrow account at closing to pay for the remediation costs. Based on the remediation cost estimates, guarantees by the seller to pay for the clean-up and the establishment of the escrow account, the Company has concluded that the property does not pose a material environmental liability.

      "Significant changes in the global economy in recent years have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP System. Some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power. In addition, industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with the various state commissions. Occasionally, these rates are first negotiated, and then filed with the state commissions. The public utility subsidiaries believe that they are unlikely to be materially adversely affected by this competition. SEASONALITY\nThe sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEPâs facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEPâs results of operations and may impact its financial condition. INVESTMENTS\nGAS OPERATIONS\nDuring 2004 we sold our interests in Louisiana Intrastate Gas and Jefferson Island Storage & Hub. In January 2005, we sold a 98% controlling interest in HPL and related assets. We currently retain a 2% ownership interest in HPL and will provide certain transitional services to the buyer. See Notes 10 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions, Dispositions, Discontinued Operations, Impairments, Assets Held for Sale and Assets Held and Used and Subsequent Events (unaudited), respectively, included in the 2004 Annual Reports for more information.",
      "Commitments and Contingencies - Regulatory Matters in Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA). Electric\nThe wholesale electric business faces increasing competition in the supply of bulk power due to provisions of the EPAct and Federal and state initiatives with respect to providing open access to utility transmission systems. The Company does not anticipate that these provisions will have a material impact on its operations in the near-term. For 1994, the Company's wholesale revenues totaled approximately 9% of total electric revenues. A substantial portion of these revenues related to firm sales contracts, which are expected to continue at current levels for a minimum of 8 years. In addition, since 1992, the Company has had a FERC-approved transmission tariff, which provides for open access, with certain limitations. During 1994, the Company was notified by one wholesale customer of its intent to reduce future firm and peaking power purchases in accordance with current contractual arrangements. This customer is seeking a CPCN to construct its own generation facilities to serve its customers' needs. The Company has proposed alternative power supply arrangements for such customer's consideration. Today, the retail electric business faces increasing competition from industrial and large commercial customers who have the ability to own or operate facilities to generate their own electric energy requirements. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting fuels, such as natural gas for heating, cooling and manufacturing purposes rather than electric energy, or of relocating their facilities to a lower cost environment. While the Company faces these challenges, it believes its rates are competitive with currently available alternatives. The Company is taking actions to lower operating costs and is working with its customers to analyze the feasibility of various options, including energy efficiency, load management and co-\ngeneration in order to better position the Company to more effectively operate in a competitive environment.",
      "Item 2 for a description of Oglethorpe's generating facilities.) These resources are generally scheduled and dispatched so as to minimize the operating cost of Oglethorpe's system. However, Oglethorpe has entered into long-term arrangements with power marketers to better utilize its resources to reduce the cost of capacity and energy delivered to the Members, in part by giving certain dispatch rights to the power marketers. (See \"Power Purchase and Sale Arrangements--Power Marketer Arrangements\" herein.) Member Demand and Energy Requirements\nThe following table shows the aggregate peak demand and energy requirements of the Members for the years 1994 through 1996 and also shows the amounts of such requirements supplied by Oglethorpe and SEPA. For the years 1994 through 1996, demand and energy requirements increased at an average annual compound growth rate of 13.2% and 9.7%, respectively.\n- ----------\n(1) System peak demand of the Members measured at the Members' delivery points (net of system losses). The significant increase in peak demand in 1995 was due in large part to a milder than normal summer in 1994. (2) Includes purchased power. (See \"Power Purchase and Sale Arrangements--Power Purchases from GPC\" and \"--Other Power Purchases\" herein.)\n(3) Supplied by SEPA through existing contracts with the Members. (See \"THE MEMBERS OF OGLETHORPE--Contracts with SEPA\".) In 1996, Cobb EMC and Jackson EMC accounted for approximately 12.5% and 11.2% of Oglethorpe's total revenues, respectively. Seasonal Variations\nThe demand for energy by the Members is influenced by seasonal weather conditions. Historically, Oglethorpe's peak demand occurs during the months of June through September. (See \"OGLETHORPE POWER Corporation--Electric Rates\".) Energy revenues track energy costs as they are incurred and also fluctuate month to month. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of Oglethorpe's fixed costs which do not vary significantly from month to month; therefore, the capacity revenues are billed and recognized in equal monthly amounts.",
      "A utilityâs cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utilityâs revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (ii) such utilityâs level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. The rates of AEPâs public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other. In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCOâs base rates are capped, subject to certain adjustments, at their mid-1999 levels until December 31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists in Virginia. Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utilityâs rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes."

      "In 1997, NS Rail was found by the STB to be \"revenue adequate\" based on results for the year 1996. A railroad is \"revenue adequate\" under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital. The revenue adequacy measure is one of several factors considered by the STB when it is called upon to rule on the reasonableness of regulated rates. PASSENGER OPERATIONS - Regularly scheduled passenger operations on NS Rail's lines consist of Amtrak trains operating between Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Charlotte and Selma, North Carolina. Commuter trains are operated on the NS Rail line between Manassas and Alexandria under contract with two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Both of these services are under contracts providing for reimbursement of related expenses incurred by NS Rail. NS Rail also leases the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois. Should the Conrail transaction become effective as proposed, NS Rail will accommodate substantially increased Amtrak and commuter passenger mileage and will conduct significant freight operations over trackage owned by Amtrak or by commuter entities.

The Montana Tunnels Mine drill hole database is summarized in Table 10:\nTABLE 10 MONTANA TUNNELS MINE DRILL HOLE DATABASE SUMMARY\nGold is analyzed by fire assay methods with a duplicate assay for each sample. Silver, lead, and zinc are analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy with a duplicate analysis once every 24 samples and are standard analyzed once every 12 samples. The majority of drill samples are analyzed at our onsite laboratory. Comparison of gold fire assay check samples indicate high sample\nvariance, though the average grade of the check sample datasets, as a whole, agreed closely. There is good correlation between silver, lead, and zinc duplicate samples. The Montana Tunnels Mine was idle for approximately four months in 2002, while we made preparations to begin the removal of waste rock at the mine. Limited production resumed in October 2002, and full production on the K-Pit resumed in April 2003.

The completed resource model for Star was used to complete Whittle pit studies and âDue Toâ analysis. Bottle roll tests from Star appear to be consistent with other areas at Standard (63.6% recovery). Valerie\nThirty-five drill logs from the 1983-1984 Pegasus projects were relogged based on Standard Mine lithology codes and entered into the Gemcom data base along with assays and 10 foot bench composites, the results of which indicate sufficient gold to warrant a future drilling program of 16 holes to confirm the data. Montana Tunnels Mine\nLocation\nThe Montana Tunnels Mine is an open pit poly-metallic mine located about five miles west of Jefferson City, Montana and has been operated since 1987. Apollo purchased the Montana Tunnels Mine in June 2002. The Montana Tunnels Mine is located in the historic âWickes-Corbinâ mining district in Section 8 of Township 7 North, Range 4 West, while the permit boundary covers portions of Section 4, 5, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, and 20. Production For the year ended December 31, 2004, a total of 33,743 ounces of gold and 970,751 ounces of silver were produced. When in full production, over the past five years, the Montana Tunnels Mine has produced\napproximately 70,000 ounces of gold, 20,000 tons of zinc, 8,500 tons of lead and 1,200,000 ounces of silver annually. We recently completed waste stripping at Montana Tunnels, which is expected to extend the life of the mine into 2007. In the future, we expect production to be closer to historical averages. The following table sets forth annual production levels for gold, silver, lead and zinc at the Montana Tunnels Mine since 2002. Description of Land, Geology, Process and Equipment\nAbout half of Section 8 lands are our owned fee lands."

A lease was also executed with Barnes & Noble for a 33,000 square-foot store including an exterior entrance facing Wolf Road, as well as an entrance fronting onto the main mall corridor. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. A lease was also executed with L.L. Bean for an approximately 30,000 square-foot store. This will be L.L.

Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop tenant sales for Colonie Center in 2006 were $302 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. However, the mediocre shop sales are in sharp contrast to the mallâs strong anchor tenant sales. We believe that in 2006, the Colonie Center Macyâs had approximately $61.5 million in sales and Sears had approximately $51 million in sales. We also believe that each will continue to operate as anchor tenant strongholds for Colonie Center. Boscovâs had annual sales of $28 million in 2006. In addition, Christmas Tree Shops reported sales in 2006 of $21 million, which equates to sales of over $379 per square foot. Collectively, the Colonie Center anchor tenants reported approximately $163 million in combined sales in 2006. We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the propertyâs rental revenue. Financing\nIn June 2005, we completed a $50.8 million first mortgage bridge financing collateralized by the Colonie Center Mall. Subsequently, in September 2006, we refinanced the bridge loan with a new construction loan that currently has a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $116 million. The new construction loan matures in October 2008. A portion of this loan, in the amount of $50.8 million, has a fixed interest rate of 6.84%.",
      "One of these newly signed leases was executed with Regal Cinemas. The new Regal Theater at Colonie will be a 60,000 square foot, luxury and state-of-the-art stadium-seated 14 screen movie theater. The theater will rise nearly 10 stories in height and will be situated over the existing roof of the mall. The height of the theater is expected to create dramatic sight lines to Interstate 87. One of the newly signed leases is the Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake Factory is widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw. The average Cheesecake Factory has sales of over $11.0 million per annum. Typical wait times for a Cheesecake Factory are one to two hours. As a result of this unusually long waiting time, an enormous amount of additional mall traffic is anticipated. In addition, a lease was recently executed with PF Changâs China Bistro for approximately 7,000 square feet. PF Changâs is also widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw with typical annual sales volumes of $6.0 million.

We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the propertyâs rental revenue. Financing\nWe financed the acquisition of Colonie Center from the net proceeds from our recent initial public offering and proceeds from the Stratford Square Mall mortgage. We may elect to place mortgage financing on the property and use the proceeds from such financing to acquire additional properties. Renovation and Repositioning Plan\nOur opportunity, with respect to Colonie Center, is to take advantage of the mallâs unusually strong anchor tenant sales and leverage such sales into higher shop tenant sales. In addition, with approximately 123,000 square feet of shop space available, there is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program.",

We paid additional consideration of $2.4 million in connection with the execution of certain pending leases that increased the purchase price to $84.6 million. We plan to invest an additional $108.1 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Colonie Center, of which we incurred $40.5 million through December 31, 2006, for an estimated total project cost of $192.7 million. Colonie Center is a 1.2 million square-foot, super-regional mall serving Albany, New York and its surrounding areas. Colonie Center is anchored by four major department stores: Macyâs, Sears, Boscovâs and Christmas Tree Shops (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond). In addition, the mall has two important âjunior anchorsâ, which are Steve & Barryâs and an f.y.e. super store. The mallâs anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Bath & Body Works, Bombay Company, The Childrenâs Place, The Gap, Limited Too and Victoriaâs Secret. The 110 shops are comprised of approximately 381,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court, restaurants and cafÃ©s."

      "A balloon payment of approximately $6,479,000 will be due in February 2002. In addition, Etec posted a security deposit equal to three months of the initial annual rent, which security deposit will be applied against the last three months rent or, if such rent has been paid, against any other amounts due to Registrant. The security deposit may be commingled with other funds of Registrant. - 8 -\nEtec has also agreed to allow Registrant to exercise its remaining 68,764 warrants by either paying the cash exercise price or by a cashless exercise in which Registrant would receive shares equal to the fair market value less the exercise price of such shares. Etec is a leading producer of electron beam and laser lithography equipment. These systems are used in the manufacturing of masks for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. PROPERTY LEASED TO WAL-MART STORES, INC.\nOn February 10, 1995, Registrant, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased a warehouse/distribution facility in Greenfield, Indiana leased to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Wal-Mart\") for $3,584,905. Concurrently with the acquisition of the property, the lease was assigned to Registrant. Registrant is required to pay the cost of insurance and taxes up to the amount of $41,280 in any lease year. The initial term of the lease ends January 31, 2005. Wal-Mart has the right to extend the lease for three five-year renewal terms. Annual basic rent is $397,235, payable monthly. During each renewal term, the lease provides for rent increases of 12% over the rent payable during the previous term. Registrant received limited recourse mortgage financing of $2,500,000 on the property in September 1995. The loan has a term of ten years, an interest rate of 8.23% per annum and provides for 36 monthly payments of interest and principal of $22,223 based on an 18 year amortization schedule followed by 84 monthly payments of interest and principal in the amount of $21,270 based upon a 20-year amortization schedule, with a balloon payment for the entire outstanding principal balance due at maturity.",
      "The lease had a term of 15 years, with four five-year renewal terms with annual rent of $1,370,325 with such rent adjusted during the first five lease years to reflect any increases or decreases in monthly debt service payments due under the loan. In August 1996, Registrant entered into a modification agreement with Etec. In consideration for the Registrant agreeing to cancel its rights for 90,546 warrants, Etec refunded $2,633,973 of the original purchase price of the property to Registrant. The refund was applied as a prepayment to the mortgage loan, and the lender reamortized the loan. The existing lease was modified to extend the initial term by nineteen months to August 31, 2011 and annual rent was reduced by $347,289 to $1,023,036. Registrant also made a commitment to fund the construction of a 60,000 square foot addition at the Etec property. The funding of the addition will consist of three installments through January 31, 1998 with a first installment of $5,000,000 made in February 1997. The lease terms will be modified upon each installment payment. With the January 1997 installment, annual rent increased by $574,000 to $1,597,036. For the second and third installments, rent will increase by an amount equal to the monthly amortization payment required to repay the installments over the remaining initial term of the lease based on an annual interest rate of 8.28% for contributions of up to $2,500,000 and an annual interest rate of 8.43% for contributions in excess of $2,500,000. The commitment to fund the addition is for a maximum of $9,000,000 including the $5,000,000 of mortgage financing, plus structuring, development and acquisition fees payable to an affiliate. In connection with the August 1996 loan prepayment, the loan was modified from interest at a variable rate to 8.03% per annum. Upon receipt of the $5,000,000 mortgage financing for the first installment of the new construction, the existing loan was increased to a balance of $8,220,000. The terms of the loan were further modified to provide for $6,300,000 of the loan to be at a fixed rate of 8.03% per annum and the remaining amount at a variable rate with monthly principal payments based on a 15-year amortization schedule.",
      "On October 14, 1994, Registrant acquired an additional 49.99% interest in the general partnership in exchange for a payment of approximately $4,840,000.\n- 7 -\nThe cost of acquiring the Gensia property and of completing the facility was $23,200,000. The general partnership financed a portion of the purchase price and the cost of completing the facility with a limited recourse mortgage loan in the amount of $13,000,000, which mortgage loan bears interest at the rate of 8.125% per annum and is fully amortizing over a term of 15 years. The initial term of the lease is 15 years, with four ten-year renewal terms. The lease provides annual rent to $2,618,000, with rent increases every five years based on a formula indexed to increases in the Consumer Price Index (the \"CPI\") with a cap of 4% in any one year. Payment of monthly installments of basic rent during the first five years of any 10-year renewal term will be in an amount equal to 95% of the Fair Market Rent (determined pursuant to the lease) of the property and is subject to adjustment at the end of the fifth year of such renewal term to reflect the percentage increase in the CPI as set forth above. In no event will the basic rent payable during the first five years of any 10-year renewal term increase or decrease by more than 22% from the basic rent in effect at the end of the prior term. Gensia is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products primarily for the treatment and diagnosis of human diseases. PROPERTY LEASED TO ETEC SYSTEMS, INC.\nOn February 9, 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant purchased from Etec Systems, Inc. (\"Etec\") the office/ manufacturing facilities of Etec in Hayward, California and entered into a net lease with Etec. Registrant contributed equity of approximately $5,610,000 to the purchase of the Etec property and obtained $6,250,000 of limited recourse mortgage financing. Registrant also was granted warrants to purchase 159,314 shares of Etec common stock.",
      "In 2002, Registrant leased approximately 2,660 square feet of such retail space (plus 1,000 square feet of storage space) for an approximate annual rent of $298,000. One of the existing retail tenants, leasing approximately 2,950 square feet for an approximate annual rent of $414,000 is delinquent in its rent payments; Registrant may evict this tenant after drawing down the letter of credit held as security for this lease. Registrant has been engaged in discussions to lease its remaining vacant retail space but has yet to enter into any binding lease agreements. During 2001, Registrant experienced vacancies in office space aggregating approximately 29,950 square feet (with aggregate annual rents of approximately $1,200,000) at 475 Fifth Avenue. One of such leases (for 14,470 square feet and annual rents of approximately $607,000) was terminated early in exchange for a fee in the approximate amount of $720,000. In late 2002 and early 2003, Registrant has experienced additional office vacancies and relocations of tenants to smaller spaces aggregating approximately 14,770 square feet, with approximate annual aggregate rent of $525,000. Registrant is currently negotiating a lease buy-out on approximately 14,860 square feet of office space (annual rent of approximately $452,000) and, as described above, has been receiving only a portion of the rent due from another office tenant (approximately 13,825 square feet at an approximate annual rent of $553,000) that will vacate the space when Registrant obtains a replacement tenant. Registrant did not enter into any new leases for office space in 2002, but in the first quarter of 2003 it has entered into leases for an aggregate of approximately 19,940 square feet at an approximate annual aggregate rent of $711,000 (after free rent periods). Registrant's leases generally provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of a porter's wage and real estate tax escalation factors; Registrant may\nincrease the electricity charge if a review demonstrates that Registrant's cost of obtaining such electricity exceeds the charge imposed on tenants. Certain tenants (leasing approximately 20% to 25% of the space in the building) have leases that provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of operating expense and real estate tax escalation factors."

We compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, primarily on the basis of the price to be paid for such properties, with numerous entities including major oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas concerns and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors are large, well-established companies and have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours.",
      "We cancelled the crude purchase contract with STUSCO effective December 1, 2011, and entered into a new crude oil purchase agreement with Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P., or Sunoco, for a term of December 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. Sunocoâs purchase price is Sunoco West Texas Intermediate Posting plus $1.33. There are other purchasers in the fields, and we believe such other purchasers would be available to purchase our production should our current purchaser discontinue operations. We have no reason to believe that any such cessation is likely to occur. To reduce exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow, we periodically utilize various derivative strategies to manage the price received for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. Our derivative strategies customarily involve the purchase of put options to provide a price floor for our production; the sale of put options, which limit the effectiveness of purchased put options at the low end of the put/call collars to market prices in excess of the strike price of the put option sold; put/call collars that establish both a floor and a ceiling price to provide price certainty within a fixed range; call options that establish a secondary floor above a put/call collar ceiling; and swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which we pay the derivative counterparty and below which we are paid by the derivative counterparty. These contracts allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our production and benefit us when market prices are less than the base floor prices or swap prices under our derivative contracts. However, we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the ceiling or swap prices in these contracts for our hedged production. See âItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Riskâ for further information about our derivative positions at December 31, 2011.",
      "SFAS 109 also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Hedging Activities -- The Company periodically enters into ------------------ agreements with third parties to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in future oil and gas prices. Gains or losses on such agreements are deferred and recognized as oil and gas revenue when the hedged production occurs. At December 31, 1996, the Company was a party to a crude oil swap agreement and a crude oil collar arrangement, each with a contract volume of 10,000 barrels per month through December 31, 1997. The swap agreement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the $18.32 per barrel contract price and the average closing NYMEX crude oil price during each month. The collar arrangement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the monthly average closing NYMEX price and the contract floor of $19.50 per barrel or the contract ceiling of $24.35 per barrel, if the monthly average closing NYMEX price falls outside of the range defined by such contract floor and contract ceiling. In accordance with SFAS 107, \"Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" the Company has estimated the fair value of its hedging arrangements utilizing the NYMEX crude oil strip at December 31, 1996. While it is not the Company's intention to terminate either of the arrangements, it is estimated that the Company would have been required to pay approximately $525,000 to terminate the arrangements on December 31, 1996. As of February 12, 1997, the estimated cost to terminate such arrangements was approximately $325,000, inclusive of the actual cost of contract settlements through that date. Due to the volatility of crude oil prices, the fair market value may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that will be realized by the Company in 1997. The Company recognized a reduction in oil revenue of $480,000, $115,000 and $95,000 under hedging agreements in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company recognized a reduction in gas revenue of $206,000 under hedging agreements in 1994."

    "choices": [
      "A) The devaluation of the Brazilian real will significantly increase the cost of purchasing equipment and services in U.S. dollars, leading to a substantial increase in the Company's expenses. This will result in a decrease in the Company's revenue stream from its Brazilian subsidiaries, which will be reflected in its financial statements as a pre-tax charge and a negative cumulative translation adjustment.",
      "B) The devaluation of the Brazilian real will not affect the Company's ability to repatriate dividends and capital, as the Brazilian government has not imposed any restrictions on the remittance of share capital and dividends. The Company's financial statements will not be impacted by the devaluation.",
      "C) The devaluation of the Brazilian real will make it more difficult for the Company to repatriate dividends and capital, as the Brazilian government may impose restrictions on the remittance of share capital and dividends if there is a material imbalance or serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments. This could lead to a decrease in the Company's revenue stream from its Brazilian subsidiaries and an increase in its expenses, which will be reflected in its financial statements.",
      "D) The devaluation of the Brazilian real will have no impact on the Company's ability to repatriate dividends and capital, as the Company's investment in Shanghai CCT McCaw is carried on its book at cost and is not subject to the same restrictions as its Brazilian subsidiaries.

      "Both markets operate at floating rates freely negotiated between the parties. The purchase of currency for repatriation of capital invested in the country and for payment of dividends to foreign shareholders of Brazilian companies is made in the commercial/financial floating market, provided that the original investment of foreign capital and capital increases were registered with the Central Bank of Brazil. In this case, there are no significant restrictions on the repatriation of share capital and remittance of dividends. The majority of the capital of Nextel S.A., the Brazilian subsidiary through which any dividends are expected to flow, has been registered with the Brazilian monetary authorities, and Nextel S.A. intends to structure future capital contributions to Brazilian subsidiaries to maximize the amount of share capital and dividends that can be repatriated through the commercial financial exchange market. There can be no assurance that Nextel S.A. can repatriate through the commercial financial exchange market share capital and dividends on foreign investments that have not been registered. Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments, the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil. The Brazilian government may also impose restrictions on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. Any such restrictions may hinder or prevent the Company from purchasing equipment required to be paid for in any currency other than Brazilian reais. Under current law, there is a 15% withholding tax on interest payments. Dividends paid out of profits generated after December 31, 1996 are currently not subject to withholding tax.

      "As a result of such devaluation, the Company will record a pre-tax charge (net of minority interests) of approximately $45.1 million on its consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 1999 related to foreign currency transaction losses. This amount has been calculated based on the outstanding amount of U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries, the average exchange rate of the Brazilian real during the first quarter of 1999 and the Company's percentage ownership interest in its Brazilian subsidiaries at the end of such period. Additionally, the Company will record a negative cumulative translation adjustment on its balance sheet (determined in a manner consistent with prior periods) of approximately $136.1 million based on the exchange rate as of the end of the first quarter of 1999, which will be reflected as an adjustment to the cumulative translation adjustment account within stockholders' equity. Although the Company cannot predict what other effects the devaluation of the Brazilian real will have on its results of operation and the value of its investments in Brazil, the devaluation could have significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations due to, among other things, (i) the additional amount in Brazilian reais that the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries will have to pay for U.S. dollar-denominated purchases of certain equipment and services; (ii) the Company's reduced U.S. dollar-converted revenue stream from its Brazilian subsidiaries; and (iii) the impact of the devaluation on the Brazilian economy, and on the economies of the other Latin American countries in which the Operating Companies conduct business.

      "The Company's investment in Shanghai CCT McCaw is carried on the Company's book at cost, which was approximately $15.7 million as of December 31, 1998. Pursuant to the current PRC Regulation on Foreign Exchange Control, Renminbi, the currency of China, is freely convertible under current account, however, it is not freely convertible under capital account. A foreign invested enterprise is permitted to convert its Renminbi earnings to foreign currencies for the purpose of enabling the foreign investors to receive dividends and interest payments. Conversion of Renminbi to foreign currencies for the purpose of repatriating foreign investors' capital contributions to, and principal payments from, a foreign invested enterprise is subject to approval by relevant government authorities, which approval will be granted upon showing that the foreign invested enterprise has been lawfully terminated and dissolved or the loan has been properly registered, as the case may be.

The Company owns 81% of the capital stock of Nextel Brazil, which entitles it to 90% of the voting rights.

      "Approval for change of control can only be granted after the commencement of commercial operations, and Nextel Brazil has failed to meet the installation requirements for a significant portion of the channels that are the subject of Option Agreements. Nextel Brazil's subsidiaries are currently conducting analog SMR system installation with regard to a significant portion of such channels and are in discussions with Anatel regarding their proposed installation and loading plan. To the extent the Company is not able to acquire the balance of the ownership interest in a particular licensee, the Company believes that Nextel S.A., a subsidiary of Nextel Brazil and the holding company for Nextel Brazil's SMR licensee companies, would be able to continue to maintain its contractual right to render management services for the operations subject to the license held by such licensee pursuant to a service agreement and receive fees under such service agreement. Nextel Brazil, however, would not own such license and the its rights with respect to such license could be limited. There can be no assurance that Anatel would not challenge the validity of such service agreements. All of Nextel Brazil's channels in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are indirectly and entirely owned by Nextel S.A. and are not held pursuant to Option Agreements nor covered by the proposed installation and loading plan referred to above. While the Company believes it will receive Anatel approval for its installation and loading plan and Anatel approval for transfer of control when it has met the installation requirements under such plan and commenced commercial operations, no assurance can be given that such approval will be obtained. Since July 13, 1994, it had been the Brazil Ministry of Communication's practice to grant SMR licenses for a 15-year period and to renew such licenses for an equal period upon submission of an application to the Brazil Ministry of Communications. Certain of the Company's licenses granted prior to July 13, 1994 were granted for a term of five years and the Company has been informed by the Brazil Ministry of Communications that such licenses have been automatically extended for a term of 15 years from their original issuance date."

      "SUNSAS SOUTH\nSouthern Star Bolivia has entered into a preliminary agreement with Goran Matcovic Vranjican (\"Matcovic\"), pursuant to which Matcovic has granted Southern Star Bolivia the option to earn an 85% interest in two exploration concessions, known as Marioly (of approximately 19,500 ha.) and Mira Maria Magdalena (of approximately 11,200 ha.) in the southern Sunsas region of Bolivia, subject to completing a due diligence investigation and consummation of a formal option agreement meeting all the requirements of Bolivian law. Southern Star Bolivia has additionally obtained a 100% interest in an exploration concession in the southern Sunsas region known as Santo Corazon (of approximately 14,700 ha.). Southern Star Bolivia has made cash payments to Matcovic of $50,000 to date in connection with the option on the Marioly and Mira Maria Magdalena concessions. Another cash payment of $70,000 is due on August 15, 1997. Additionally, to earn its 85% interest, Southern Star Bolivia must (i) incur minimum expenditures of $350,000 and complete a minimum of 2,000 m of diamond drilling on the concessions within 24 months after execution of a formal option agreement and (ii) complete at some point (no fixed time limit) a \"pre-feasibility study\" on the concessions sufficient, in Southern Star\nBolivia's judgment, to justify commissioning a formal feasibility study thereon. Southern Star Bolivia may terminate the preliminary option agreement at any time without further obligation. The Property\nThe Sunsas area is located in southeastern Bolivia, in the Department of Santa Cruz, in the Angel Sandoval Province, approximately 400 km from Santa Cruz. The area of the concession consists of the Goran Matkovic options and the Santo Corazon concession. From Santa Cruz, the area is accessed by dirt road. Work Program\nDuring 1996, the regional exploration effort comprised 66 rock, 639 soil, 256 pan concentrate and 14 BLEG samples. Gold was panned in the majority of the Matkovic block drainages, with up to 3 relatively coarse gold colors (up to 1 mm).",
      "The country has nine Departments with a total population of approximately 10 million. The capital and principal city, located in western Bolivia, is La Paz. Southern Star has established an administrative office in the city of Santa Cruz in central Bolivia. In addition to the San Simon and Sunsas South properties described below, Southern Star has acquired or is in the process of acquiring rights on at least 15 other early stage gold and diamond exploration properties in Bolivia. SAN SIMON\nPursuant to a joint venture agreement dated as of February 23, 1996 among Jean Marc Marie Teisseire Bellini and Nelson Herrera Ribera, two Bolivian nationals (collectively, \"Teisseire and Herrera\") and Southern Star Bolivia S.R.L., the wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Star, Southern Star Bolivia acquired the right to undertake exploration, development and exploitation activities on the five concessions in the San Simon region of northeastern Bolivia, covering an aggregate of approximately 14,600 ha. Southern Star Bolivia, in its discretion, may exclude all or portions of the five concessions from the joint venture at any time, subject to certain limitations, and may terminate the joint venture at any time without further obligation. In October 1996, Southern Star Bolivia opted to exclude three of the five concessions (covering approximately 6,000 ha) from the joint venture and relinquished any further rights with respect thereto. The two concessions remaining in the joint venture are known as Marco Maria (approximately 5,200 ha.) and Ibere (approximately 3,300 ha.). As of December 31, 1996, Southern Star Bolivia has made cash payments to Teisseire and Herrera of approximately $0.1 million in connection with the joint venture. Additionally, Southern Star Bolivia must pay: $7 per hectare for each hectare remaining subject to the joint venture as of October 31, 1997; and $10 per hectare for each hectare remaining subject to the joint venture as of October 31, 1998. Commencing on October 31, 1999, and each six months thereafter, Southern Star Bolivia must pay Teisseire and Herrera (jointly) advance royalty payments of $15,000 until the commencement of commercial production on a mine, which amounts shall be offset by deducting 50% of all future royalty payments earned until the amounts advanced are repaid in full.",

These scheduled payments must be made to keep our option to acquire these concessions in good standing. Failure to make the payments would cancel our options to acquire these concessions. History\nThe main vein in the area, the Santo Nino vein was the focus of a small scale underground gold mining operation in the late 1800âs and early 1900âs, with at least three main underground mine access drifts supplying feed to a centrally located mill, which is still present.",

During June 2007 Solitario must pay $35,000 to keep the agreement in force for one year. We may elect to terminate the option at anytime without any additional payment or work commitment obligations due to the underlying owner. The project is located about 50 kilometers east of the Bolivian capital of La Paz at an elevation of approximately 4,500 meters. Access is gained by a well-maintained gravel road from La Paz. We have completed construction of a 2.5-kilometer road to the property. The project hosts a large mineralized area extending for at least 800 meters in length and up to 200 meters in width. Mineralization occurs as a stockwork zone of veining within a sequence of Paleozoic shales, siltstones and quartzites. Within the mineralized zone, surface sampling has returned elevated values of gold, silver, lead and zinc. We currently have the project on care and maintenance status until the political situation in Bolivia becomes sufficiently stable to justify a more significant exploration program.

      "Assuming all renewal or extension options are exercised, the average remaining term is approximately seven years. Fees\nGenerally, the management agreements for franchised hotels contain a two-tiered fee structure in which the management company receives a base management fee and, if certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management\nfee, each calculated on a per hotel basis. The base management fees range from 2% to 3% of gross hotel revenue, with some base fees increasing over time. Almost all of the incentive management fees range from 15% to 30% of net operating income (or other similar metric, as defined in the management agreement) remaining after deducting a priority return typically equal to 9% to 11% of our total capital investment in the hotel. We also pay certain accounting services fees to the management companies under a majority of the agreements. Termination Events\nPerformance Termination\nAs with our management agreements for brand-managed hotels, most of the management agreements for franchised hotels provide us with a right to terminate the agreement if the management company fails to achieve certain criteria relating to the performance of the hotel. Generally, we may initiate a performance termination if, during any two consecutive year period, (i) the hotel fails to achieve a specified amount of operating profit, and (ii) certain operating metrics of the hotel, as compared to a competitive set of hotels in the relevant local market as agreed between the parties, fail to exceed a specified threshold as set forth in the applicable management agreement. In some of the management agreements for franchised hotels, the management company has a right, which can usually be exercised no more than once per hotel, to avoid a performance termination by paying an amount specified in the applicable management agreement. Early Termination and Liquidated Damages\nSubject to certain qualifications, notice requirements and applicable cure periods, the management agreements for franchised hotels are generally terminable by either party upon a material casualty or condemnation of the hotel or the occurrence of certain customary events of default, including, among others: the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party; a breach by either party of covenants or obligations under the management agreement, including a failure by us to provide required operating funds or our failure to make a payment when due and failure to cure such non-payment after due notice; a default by either party under the corresponding franchise agreement; a failure of either party to maintain a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages; and a failure by either party to maintain insurance policies required under the management agreement.",

In addition, the calculation of the contingent incentive fee includes the basic fee at the original 4%. As of January 1, 1996, the basic management fee has returned to 4%. Management fees paid to Hyatt for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were approximately $734,000, $520,000 and $482,000, respectively. The incentive fee earned for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was approximately $356,000, $232,000 and $134,000, respectively."

      "TMRC and its co-applicants, K-Tech, Inventure Renewables, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Penn State University are proposing to plan, develop, design and install the CIX/CIC pilot plant at one of the Jeddo Coal properties. The grant was awarded in March 2017 to a consortium consisting of Inventure Renewables, Penn State, K-Tech and TMRC with Inventure being the principal investigator in the consortium. Funding began in September 2017. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed 28 June 2016, TMRC had a six month term to perform the necessary due diligence and to technically and economically evaluate the properties. Upon execution of the MOU TMRC and PEI had six months to draft and execute a formal lease agreement containing all the standard terms of mining lease agreements. Upon execution of a lease, TMRC will be obligated to pay a $5,000 per month rental or a 12% royalty whichever is greater. As of the date of this filing, no lease has been executed. Fundamentals of the Scandium Market\nScandium, like yttrium, is not technically a rare earth element but shares their exceptional chemical properties. The useful properties of scandium (Sc) are well known but its wide use has been retarded by lack of supply. Currently almost all is supplied principally by Russia and also by China. Russiaâs supply is a by-product of uranium mining and Chinaâs is from the Bataou Iron mine along with rare earth. Scandium excels in two uses: solid oxide fuel cells and high strength aluminum alloy. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCâs) can efficiently produce electricity using a mixture of zirconium oxide and scandium oxide as the solid electrolyte layer of the cell. This technology has been known for a long time but its use has been restricted by their high operating temperatures. The use of scandium oxide lowers the operating temperature of these cells to an operationally practical level. The other, and at the present time, far more important, use of scandium is an alloy of aluminum. This technology originated in Russia (USSR at that time), owing to their source of Sc, where it was discovered that these alloys have high-strength, stress resistance, temperature resistance and have superior welding characteristics.",
      "Northeast Pennsylvania Scandium Project\nOn June 28, 2016 TMRC executed a Memorandum of understanding with Pagnotti Enterprises Inc. of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, owners of the Jeddo Coal Co., whereby under specified terms TMRC could lease one or more of Jeddoâs deposits located in the anthracite region of northeast Pennsylvania. Research by the Department of Energy (DOE) has shown that these coal deposits and the sandstones and siltstones immediately associated with them contain anomalously high values of rare earth and on particular interest, Scandium. The DOE research to date has indicated that the rare earth can be efficiently extracted from pulverized rock using ammonium sulfate as the lixiviant. TMRC is in the process of preparing an application for a federal grant to design and construct a continuous ion exchange/continuous ion chromatography (CIX/CIC) pilot plant to be delivered to a designated project area in the Appalachian cold province. TMRC and its co-applicants, K-Tech, Inventure Renewables, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Penn State University are proposing to plan, develop, design and install the CIX/CIC pilot plant at one of the Jeddo Coal properties.

A trial on the motion for reconsideration was completed in January 2008 and on February 25, 2009 the Court entered a judgment in our favor in the amount of $91,431,300. This judgment is subject to appeal by the government. On January 12, 2007, the Court entered an order of final judgment awarding the lessees restitution of the original lease bonuses paid for thirty five of the forty lawsuit leases. Under this order we are entitled to receive a gross amount of approximately $58.5 million, and Amber is entitled to receive a gross amount of approximately $1.5 million as reimbursement for the lease bonuses paid for all lawsuit leases other than Lease 452. The order of final judgment was affirmed in all respects by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 25, 2008, and the governmentâs petition seeking a rehearing of that decision was denied on December 5, 2008; however, on December 24, 2008, the Federal Circuit entered an order imposing a stay of the issuance of its mandate for a period of 90 days pending consideration of and the possible filing by the government of a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.

The government has appealed the order and contends that, among other things, the Court erred in finding that it breached the leases, and in allowing the current lessees to stand in the shoes of their predecessors for the purposes of determining the amount of damages that they are entitled to receive. The current lessees are also appealing the order of final judgment to, among other things, challenge the Courtâs rulings that they cannot recover their and their predecessorsâ sunk costs as part of their restitution claim. No payments will be made until all appeals have either been waived or exhausted. In the event that we ultimately receive any proceeds as the result of this litigation, we will be obligated to pay a portion to landowners and other owners of royalties and similar interests, to pay the litigation expenses and to fulfill certain pre-existing contractual commitments to third parties.

      "These property interests are located in proximity to existing producing federal offshore units near Santa Barbara, California and represent the right to explore for, develop and produce oil and gas from offshore federal lease units. Preliminary exploration efforts on these properties have occurred and the existence of substantial quantities of hydrocarbons has been indicated. The recovery of our investment in these properties will require extensive exploration and development activities (and costs) that cannot proceed without certain regulatory approvals that have been delayed and is subject to other substantial risks and uncertainties. We and our 92% owned subsidiary, Amber, are among twelve plaintiffs in a lawsuit that was filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims (the âCourtâ) in Washington, D.C. alleging that the U.S. government materially breached the terms of forty undeveloped federal leases, some of which are part of our offshore California properties. On November 15, 2005 and October 31, 2006, the Court granted summary judgment as to liability and partial summary judgment as to damages with respect to thirty six of the forty total federal leases that are the subject of the litigation. Under a restitution theory of damages, the Court ruled that the government must give back to the current lessees the more than $1.1 billion in lease bonuses it had received at the time of sale. On January 19, 2006, the government filed a motion for reconsideration of the Courtâs ruling as it relates to a single lease owned entirely by us (âLease 452â). In its motion for reconsideration, the government has asserted that we should not be able to recover lease bonus payments for Lease 452 because, allegedly, a significant portion of the hydrocarbons has been drained by wells that were drilled on an immediately adjacent lease. The amount of lease bonus payments attributable to Lease 452 is approximately $92.0 million.

We may extend the leases prior to their expiration based upon planned activities or for other business activities. Desta Drilling\nThrough Desta Drilling, we currently operate 14 drilling rigs, two of which we lease under long-term contracts. The Desta Drilling rigs are primarily reserved for our use, but are available to conduct contract drilling operations for third parties from time to time. As of February 25, 2013, we were using four of our rigs to drill wells in our developmental drilling programs, four rigs were working for third parties and the remaining six rigs were idle. Offices\nWe lease from a related partnership approximately 89,000 square feet of office space in Midland, Texas for our corporate headquarters. We also lease approximately 7,600 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas and 1,400 square feet in College Station, Texas from unaffiliated third parties. Item 3",
      "(a) Net undeveloped acres are attributable to the following areas: Utah - 52,404; Mississippi - 41,608; Colorado - 28,798; and Other - 30,114. The following table sets forth expiration dates of the leases of our gross and net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2010. (a) Acres expiring are based on contractual lease maturities. We may extend the leases prior to their expiration based upon planned activities or for other business activities. Desta Drilling\nThrough a wholly-owned subsidiary, Desta Drilling, we currently own and operate 12 drilling rigs, consisting of six 1,000 horsepower rigs and six 1,300 horsepower rigs. As of February 18, 2011, we were using ten of our rigs to drill wells in our developmental drilling program. The Desta Drilling rigs are currently reserved for our use, but we may conduct contract drilling operations for third parties in the future. In February 2011, we sold two 2,000 horsepower drilling rigs and related equipment for aggregate consideration of $22 million, and we expect to record a gain on the sale of approximately $13.2 million during the first quarter of 2011. Proceeds from the sale consisted of $11 million cash and an $11 million promissory note due in August 2011. Offices\nWe lease from a related partnership approximately 71,000 square feet of office space in Midland, Texas for our corporate headquarters. We also lease approximately 10,500 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas from unaffiliated third parties. Item 3",
      "Development, Exploration and Acquisition Capital Expenditures\nThe following table presents information regarding the Companyâs net costs incurred in the purchase of proved and unproved properties and in exploration and development activities:\nProductive Oil and Gas Wells\nThe following summarizes the Companyâs productive and shut-in oil and gas wells as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we operated 133 gross (79.4 net to our interest) producing wells and 3 gross (3 net) shut-in wells located on these properties. Oil and Gas Acreage\nExploration and Productive Acreage\nThe following table sets forth our ownership interest in undeveloped and developed leasehold acreage, in the areas indicated as of December 31, 2010. The table does not include acreage that we have a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which we have not yet received leasehold assignments. In certain leases, our ownership is not the same for all depths; therefore, the net acres in these leases are calculated using the greatest ownership interest at any depth. Generally this greater interest represents our ownership in the primary objective formation. Undeveloped Acreage\nThe following table summarizes our ownership interest in the gross and net undeveloped acreage in the areas indicated that will expire in each of the next three years. The Companyâs acreage positions are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or by the existence of a producing well on the acreage. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 82% of the gross acreage that we hold is located on federal lands and approximately 17% of the acreage is located on state lands. It has been our experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands. We have generally been able to obtain state permits within 60 days, while obtaining federal permits has taken approximately 24 months or longer."

      "Amax was merged into Cyprus Minerals in 1992 to form Cyprus Amax. PD then acquired the Lucky Jack molybdenum property Project in 1999 through its acquisition of Cyprus Amax. Thereafter, PD acquired additional water rights and patents to certain claims to mine and mill the deposit. In its 1992 patent application to the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior (âBLMâ), Amax stated that the size and grade of the Mount Emmons deposit was determined to approximate 220 million tons grading 0.366% molybdenite. In a letter dated April 2, 2004, BLM estimated that there were about 23 million tons of mineable reserves containing 0.689% molybdenite, and that about 267 million pounds of molybdenum trioxide was recoverable. This letter covered only the high-grade mineralization which is only a portion of the total mineral deposit delineated to date. The BLM relied on a mineral report prepared by Western Mine Engineering (WME) for the U.S. Forest Service, which directed and administered the WME contract. WMEâs analysis was based upon a price of $4.61 per pound for molybdic oxide and was used by BLM in determining that nine claims satisfied the patenting requirement that the mining claims contain a valuable mineral that could be mined profitably. WME consulted a variety of sources in preparation of its report, including a study prepared in 1990 by American Mine Services, Inc. and a pre-feasibility report prepared by Behre Dolbear & Company, Inc. of Denver, CO in 1998. Uranium - Mining Properties\nThe Company owns the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in southeastern Utah, holds approximately 40,000 acres of mineral claims and leases, and own historical libraries/data covering several mines and exploration areas in Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. These properties range from exploration to pre-production status. The property locations include the historic producing areas in Lisbon Valley, San Juan County, Utah; Crooks Gap, Fremont County, Wyoming; the Uravan Mineral belt of Colorado, and the Arizona Strip area of Mohave and Coconino Counties, Arizona.",
      "Amax was merged into Cyprus Minerals in 1992 to form Cyprus Amax. PD then acquired Mount Emmons in 1999 through its acquisition of Cyprus Amax.

Even with the historical data available, the size, configuration and operations of the mine plan that may be proposed by TCM have not been finalized. These factors, as well as the prevailing prices for molybdic oxide when the mine is active, will determine the economic viability of the project. The $4.61 price used by WME should not be considered to be a current breakeven price for Mount Emmons. It is anticipated that a full feasibility study will be prepared in the future, using current and expected capital costs, and operating expenses, to estimate the viability of the project. In December 2008, an additional 160 acres of fee land in the vicinity of the claims was purchased for $4 million ($2 million in January 2009, $400,000 annually for five years).",
      "In the late 1970s, Amax delineated a large deposit of molybdenum on the properties, reportedly containing approximately 155 million tons of mineralized material averaging 0.44% molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). In 1981, Amax constructed a water treatment plant at the Mount Emmons molybdenum property to treat water flowing from the old Keystone mine workings and for potential use in milling operations. By 1983, Amax had reportedly spent an estimated $150 million in the acquisition of the property, securing water rights, extensive exploration, ore body delineation, mine planning, metallurgical testing and other activities involving the mineral deposit. Amax was merged into Cyprus Minerals in 1992 to form Cyprus Amax. PD then acquired Mount Emmons in 1999 through its acquisition of Cyprus Amax. Thereafter, PD acquired additional conditional water rights and patents to certain mineral claims. The exploration work conducted in the late 1970âs by Amax, Inc. as discussed in Cyprus Amaxâs Patent Claim Application to the Bureau of Land Management dated December 23, 1992, defined the initial mineralized material at the Mount Emmons Project as follows: âMolybdenite is present in randomly distributed veinlets (i.e. stockwork veining) and in some larger veins that are up to two feet wide. This mineralized zone is found in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and in Tertiary igneous complex which acted as the source of the mineralization.â There also are a number of existing mine adits located on the property. Historic work completed by Amax, Inc. in the 1970s and early 1980s included: 2,400 feet of new drift with 18 underground diamond drill stations to facilitate underground drilling (consisting of 168 diamond drill holes for a total of 157,037 feet of core drilling). The majority of the drilling was concentrated within 3,000 feet north and south; 3,000 feet east and west and 2,000 vertical feet defining the area of mineralized material. A bulk sample\nwas collected from this area and sent off site for metallurgical testing.",
      "Amax, Inc. also facilitated the completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (âEISâ) as required by NEPA for the Plan of Operations submitted to the United States Forest Service (âUSFSâ). The Amax, Inc. EIS is now outdated. In its 1992 patent application, Cyprus Amax stated that the size and grade of the Mount Emmons deposit was determined to approximate 220 million tons of mineralized material grading 0.366% molybdenite. In a letter dated April 2, 2004, the BLM estimated that there were about 23 million tons of mineralized material containing 0.689% molybdenite, and that about 267 million pounds of molybdenum trioxide was recoverable.

These factors, as well as the prevailing prices for molybdic oxide when the mine is active, will determine the economic viability of the project. We note that the statements made by the predecessor owners of the Mount Emmons Project regarding ârecoverableâ minerals and âmineable âreservesâ were based on costs, permitting requirements, and commodity prices then prevailing. The $4.61 price used by WME should not be considered to be a current breakeven price for Mount Emmons."

At December 31, 1994, there were approximately 1,585 non-serviceable freight cars in storage, which included freight cars awaiting sale to a third party for rehabilitation and leaseback and freight cars scheduled for repair. At December 31, 1993, the Company owned and leased 1,878 and 357 locomotives, respectively and 31,481 and 10,329 freight cars, respectively. The components of the Company's equipment lease and rental expense are shown below (in million of dollars):\nCapital Expenditures and Maintenance. Improvement and on-going maintenance of roadway, structures and equipment are essential components of the Company's efforts to improve service and reduce operating costs. The Company has made the following railroad capital expenditures in order to maintain and improve train service (in millions of dollars):\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n(1) Excludes equipment previously under operating leases purchased with $65.3 million of the proceeds of capital and debt transactions ($30.1 million for locomotives and $35.2 million for freight cars). The Company's capital expenditures for railroad operations for 1995 are expected to be approximately $317 million (exclusive of capital leases) including $271 million for roadway and structures and $46 million for railroad equipment and other items. The Company has ordered an additional 206 AC powered locomotives to be financed by capitalized lease financing that are scheduled to be delivered during the second and third quarters of 1995. In addition, the Company has ordered 920 new hopper cars and expects to receive approximately 1,500 reconditioned freight cars in 1995. The Company expects to finance these acquisitions through capitalized lease financing. The total expected capitalized lease obligation to be incurred during 1995, including the 1,600 reconditioned freight cars received in 1994 for which financing is scheduled to be arranged in 1995, is approximately $400 million.",
      "On December 31, 1995, the average age of Conrail's road locomotives, not including stored-serviceable units, was 14.8 years (or 10.5 years defining \"road locomotive\" as those with 3,000 horsepower and above). The average age of the total locomotive fleet was 15.2 years, and the average age of the total freight car fleet was 22.1 years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

Including subsidiaries, Conrail's average number of employees for 1995 was 23,510. Consolidated Rail Corporation (excluding subsidiaries) averaged 22,631 employees in 1995, 86% of whom are represented by a total of 14 labor organizations and are covered by 22 separate collective bargaining agreements. Conrail is currently engaged in collective bargaining with the labor organizations representing its union employees, which commenced on November 1, 1994. During 1995, CRC reached an agreement with approximately 300 of its employees represented by the Fraternal Order of Police. In addition, a tentative agreement was reached with approximately 4,000 of its employees represented by the United Transportation Union through negotiations carried on by the National Carriers' Committee, of which CRC is a member.",
      "In all, as\nof December 31, 1995, 7,656 miles of track were controlled by automatic signal systems. Conrail is engaged in an ongoing process to identify certain under- utilized rail lines and other underperforming assets to avoid future capital costs and to improve its return on assets. Conrail recorded a $285 million charge in 1995 to cover the expected losses upon disposition of approximately 1,800 miles of lines and other assets not required to support Conrail's service. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. Previously, the expected losses upon disposition of similar assets were included in the 1991 special charge. See Note 5 to the Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following table indicates the number of locomotives and freight cars owned (or subject to capitalized leases) and includes 21,948 freight cars used by Conrail under operating leases. These total figures are as of December 31, 1995, and include stored or surplus units, but exclude subsidiaries other than Consolidated Rail Corporation, which have an immaterial number of locomotives and freight cars:\nLOCOMOTIVES AND FREIGHT CARS\nNumber of Units Total Stored(1) ------ ------ LOCOMOTIVES........................ 2,023 41 ----- -- Road............................. 1,815 5 Switching........................ 208 36\nTotal Surplus(2) ------ ------- FREIGHT CARS....................... 51,404 4,393 ------ ----- Box.............................. 8,299 1,332 Covered Hopper................... 4,410 0 Open Hopper...................... 12,409 2,405 Gondola.......................... 7,093 168 Coil Steel....................... 11,725 75 Multi-Level...................... 5,874 169 Flat and Other................... 1,594 244 - ----------- (1) Serviceable locomotives not required for current operations on December 31, 1995.

The number of surplus freight cars during 1995 fluctuated due to variations in traffic and fleet adjustments.",
      "ENCUMBRANCES - Certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately $895 million as of Dec. 31, 2001, and $816 million at Dec. 31, 2000. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES - Capital expenditures for road, equipment and other property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):\n\tCapital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million of capital spending. See the discussion following \"Cash used for investing activities,\" on Page 40 in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis. \"\n\tENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS goal. To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive position. See the discussion of \"Environmental Matters\" on Page 45 in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis,\" and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on Page 79.\n\tEMPLOYEES - NS employed an average of 30,894 employees in 2001, compared with an average of 33,738 in 2000. The decrease reflects the effects of the early retirement and work-force reduction programs in 2000. The approximate average cost per employee during 2001 was $52,000 in wages and $21,000 in employee benefits. Approximately 85 percent of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. See the discussion of \"Labor Agreements\" on Page 43 in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis. \"\n\tGOVERNMENT REGULATION - In addition to environmental, safety, securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject to regulation by the STB, which succeeded the ICC on Jan. 1, 1996. The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Agreements with subcontractors provide for a fixed price for work performed or materials supplied and are generally short-term. The Company does not manufacture any of the materials or other items used in the development of its projects, nor does the Company maintain substantial inventories of materials. Standard building materials, appliances and other components are purchased in volume. The Company has not experienced significant delays in obtaining materials needed by it to date and has long-standing relationships with many of its major suppliers and contractors. None of the Company's suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total purchases in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995. Sales and Customer Financing\nThe Company conducts a marketing program that is directed to purchasers of primary residences. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, A.P. Orleans Inc., an affiliate of the Company controlled by Jeffrey P. Orleans, is the exclusive sales agent. The Company believes that the compensation arrangement with A.P. Orleans, Inc. is no less favorable to the Company that could be obtained from an unaffiliated sales agent. This compensation includes payment to A.P. Orleans, Inc. of $25.00 for each house settled in its Pennsylvania and New Jersey communities. Model homes and sales centers are constructed to promote sales. A variety of custom changes are permitted at the request of purchasers. The Company advertises extensively using newspapers, billboards and other types of media. The Company also uses brochures to describe each community. The Company's customers generally require mortgage financing to complete their purchases. The Company offers assistance to its customers in obtaining mortgage financing on the basis of the credit of the purchasers. The Company believes adequate sources of financing are available for qualified customers. The Company applies for project financing approvals from the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration and the Federal National Mortgage Association for many of its moderately priced communities.",
      "These approvals assist customers in their ability to obtain competitive fixed and adjustable rate mortgages with moderate down payments and liberal underwriting requirements. The Company has obtained approvals for most projects and anticipates additional approvals during fiscal 1996; however, there can be no assurance that additional approvals will be obtained. Land Policy\nThe Company acquires land in order to provide an adequate and well-located supply for its residential building operations. In evaluating possible opportunities to acquire land, the Company considers such factors as the feasibility of development, proximity to developed areas, population growth patterns, customer preferences, estimated cost of development and availability and cost of financing. In conjunction with the OCC acquisition, the Company obtained the right to acquire real estate in East Brunswick, New Jersey through an option agreement with Orleans Builders and Developers (\"OB&D\"). OB&D is owned by Jeffrey P. Orleans and the trust of Selma Orleans. The agreement, which has no stated expiration date, provides for the purchase of 342 residential units in total. Subsequent to June 30, 1995, the Company purchased two (2) tracts of land in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. One tract consists of 76 lots for townhomes. The other tract of 72 lots consists of 15 large single-family lots and 57 small single-family lots. The Company will continue to monitor economic and market conditions for residential units in each of its various communities in assessing the relative desirability of constructing units or selling parcels to other builders. The Company engages in many phases of development activity, including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, construction of roads, sewer, water and drainage facilities, recreation facilities and other amenities. Joint Ventures\nFrom time to time, the Company has developed and owned projects through joint ventures with other parties. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is the General Partner in Versailles Associates, L.P., a limited partnership with private investors to purchase and develop a 102 multi-family unit community in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.",
      "The Company believes that neither the implementation of the settlement agreement nor the resolution of this contingency through further litigation will have a material effect on its results of operations or its financial position, although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation. Since there are conditions to the implementation of the settlement agreement, there is no assurance that the litigation will not recommence. The Company is not aware of any other environmental liabilities associated with any of its other projects. Competition\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of its reputation, location, design, price, financing programs, quality of product and related amenities, with regional and national home builders in its areas of development, some of which have greater sales, financial resources and geographical diversity than the Company. Numerous local residential builders and individual resales of residential units and homesites provide additional competition. Employees\nThe Company, as of June 30, 1995, employed 194 persons, 63 of whom were executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 37 were sales personnel, and 94 were construction supervisory personnel and laborers. The level of construction and sales employees varies throughout the year in relation to the level of activities at the Company's various developments. The Company has had no major work stoppages and considers its relations with employees to be good. Economic Conditions\nThe Company's business is affected by general economic conditions in the United States and its related regions and particularly by the level of interest rates. The Company cannot predict whether interest rates will be at levels attractive to prospective home buyers or whether mortgage and construction financing will continue to be available. Further, the current economic climate and lack of consumer confidence within the Company's customer base have lessened the demand for new housing.",
      "The Company still holds an interest in one affordable limited partnership with 868 units. The Company will retain its ownership interest and will continue to manage this property located in Columbus, Ohio. The Company has retained the ability to develop new market rate communities. It plans to engage in development activity only on a selective basis. The Company anticipates the development activity to be in the markets in which it currently is doing business, on land adjacent to existing properties or by increasing density of units at communities currently owned. Currently, the Company is developing a 120-unit apartment community in South Portland, Maine adjacent to a market-rate property the Company acquired in 1998. The first phase of the project, which consists of 48 units, was completed in the summer of 2005. The second and third phases, which consist of 72 units, are expected to be completed in the summer of 2006. The total construction cost at this community is anticipated to be $13.6 million upon completion. In addition, the Company is developing a 216-unit apartment community in Allentown, Pennsylvania, adjacent to a market-rate community purchased in 2000. The project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2008. The total construction cost for this development is anticipated to be $27.1 million upon completion. The construction in progress for these two development projects amounted to $4.5 million as of December 31, 2005. Property Management -------------------\nAs of December 31, 2005, the Managed Properties consist of: (i) 868 apartment units where Home Properties is the general partner of the entity that owns the property; and (ii) 2,701 apartment units managed for others. On January 1, 2004, the Company sold certain assets of its commercial property management division to Home Leasing LLC, which is owned by Nelson and Norman Leenhouts, who were the founders of Home Leasing, former Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company, and current Co-Chairs of the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Leenhoutses\").",
      "The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 175 basis points and has a term of three years. Simultaneous with the closing of the construction bridge loan, the joint venture admitted another equity partner which is obligated to contribute approximately $7,300,000 in exchange for receiving the benefit of certain tax credits, when certain conditions are met. A portion of these equity contributions will be used to repay the bridge loan. Through December 31, 2004 we have invested $4,867,000 in the joint venture. Northbrook Development Parcel-In November 2003 we acquired for $2,000,000 a 9.6-acre tract of land in the commercial office park in Trevose, Pennsylvania, which hosts the 900 Northbrook and One Northbrook buildings. We plan to develop a commercial office building, containing approximately 108,000 square feet, on the land. North Broad Street Associates, L.P.-In August 2003 a joint venture in which we own a 95% interest, and two unaffiliated third parties own the balance, acquired a historic building in Philadelphia, PA, called the Divine Lorraine, for a purchase price of $2,295,000. The joint venture plans to redevelop the building into an approximately 135 unit apartment property. We invested $2,375,000 for our interest in the joint venture. In October 2004, the joint venture acquired 3.8 acres of land adjacent to the Divine Lorraine, from the School District of Philadelphia for $3,580,000. The land parcel was acquired for the purpose of developing a parking lot for the Divine Lorraine and for future development projects. We contributed all the proceeds necessary to fund the acquisition, with such funds obtained through draws on an unsecured line of credit. Cigar Factory Apartments L.P.-In July, 2003, we invested $1,000,000 in exchange for a 66.7% interest in both Cigar Factory Apartments L.P. (\"Cigar Factory\") and Orianna Street Development, LLC (\"Orianna Street\"). Two unaffiliated third parties own the remaining 33.3% interest in both Cigar Factory and Orianna Street. Cigar Factory owns a warehouse in Philadelphia, PA, which is being redeveloped into a 30 unit for-sale condominium property, together with parking and associated spaces."

      "Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Topography\nFrom Reno, Nevada, access to the New Dawn property is by Interstate Freeway I-80 east for about 280 miles to Elko (Exit 301 on I-80), then north to paved State Highway 225 for about 26 miles, then northwest on paved State Highway 226, and then turning off to the west onto the county maintained gravel road SSR 18 that heads toward the historic mining town of Tuscarora. After about 6 miles this gravel road turns due south. After heading due south about 1 mile, turn onto a secondary gravel road heading due west for about 4 miles past the Quarter Circle S Ranch and along the north side of McCann Creek. Take the west fork onto a dirt track that heads northwest and then curves to the southwest then southeast, and eventually heads south along a ridge top, passing through the New Dawn property after about 2.5 miles. The climate in this part of Nevada is typical of the high desert country of the American southwest, with hot summers, cold winters and generally dry conditions. Temperature variations recorded for the area extend from a minimum of -40Â° F to a maximum of 108Â° F, with average temperatures of 16Â° F in winter and 84Â° F in summer (Western Regional Climate Center). This is semi-arid desert, with an average annual precipitation of 12.5 inches. Heavy snowfall can be expected in the higher ranges, but the climate should not be an impediment to mining, especially if the operations were underground. Mining at open pits elsewhere in Nevada, in roughly similar conditions, is continued year round. Physical exploration work could be conducted on the New Dawn property year round, except during early spring when the frozen ground is melting and the unimproved dirt roads become muddy and difficult to travel. Vegetation in this part of Nevada is generally confined to grasses and sagebrush, with local stands of willows, trembling aspen and some cottonwoods in valley bottoms, and local areas with dwarf juniper and pines. The property area includes summer grazing leases for cattle from local ranches.",
      "The nearest major supply point that would support a major mining related activity is Las Vegas, Nevada about 160 kilometres to the southeast. There are several accessible old mine workings. Access around both Properties is by a series of reasonably good gravel and dirt roads that extend to most of the important exploration areas. The Properties are in Western Nevadaâs high desert, which receives about 15 centimetres of precipitation per year, mostly as modest snow fall in the winter and thunderstorms in the summer. The average daily temperature (Â°F) varies from a low of 40 (5 Â°C) in January to a high of 80 (27 Â°C) in July. The hills at the Properties are covered with sparse low brush including creosote, four-wing saltbush, rabbit brush and Nevada ephedra. The Properties are in the Basin and Range province, with the local topographic relief ranging from only a few hundred feet to 1000 feet. Most of the areas at the Properties are characterized by low hills separated by modest width valleys. There are currently no other structures or infrastructure on the Properties. Major mining and construction equipment sales and service are readily available throughout Nevada; however, most major mining operations are located in the northern part of the state and are serviced from the cities of Reno and Elko. Human resources are readily available within the community of Beatty and historically provided a substantial portion of the workforce for the Bullfrog Mine, which operated between 1989 and 1998 as both an open pit and underground gold mining operation. Pahrump, approximately 110 kilometres to the southeast of Beatty, is a larger community with a population of 36,000. Pahrump is a local regional center, with a hospital and emergency medical services, a college campus with technical training for industrial support and expanded service sectors. Electrical power is provided to the immediate area of both the NBP and Mother Lode Properties by the Valley Electric Association, Inc. (âVEAâ), which is headquartered in Pahrump.",
      "Access is approximately 40 kilometers south along State Highway 306 from Beowawe, then south-southwest along a well-maintained gravel road another 8 kilometers to a jeep trail to the property. Elevations range from 5,000 feet to over 7,200 feet. The topography can be locally severe and generally consists of low to high rolling hills. The properties are generally covered by sagebrush and grass with a juniper and pinyon pines. The temperatures are cool to cold during the winter, with occasional moderate snowfalls, and are warm during the summer with cool nights. The climate is favorable for year-round mining and exploration may be done from May through November, after which road access is limited by snow during the winter and mud in the spring. Conditions can vary from year to year. Water is generally not available on the surface, but can be obtained from BLM wells and various locations near the properties. The claims carry with them the surface rights for mining. There are sufficient flat areas present on or near the property areas for potential processing plant sties, tailings storage areas, waste disposal areas and leach pads. The exposed upper plate rocks at the NAD property have been tested without reaching lower plate carbonates. The northeast structural zone has only received limited shallow drilling, also without testing lower plate rocks. Therefore, potential remains at the NAD property to find high-grade gold mineralization within lower plate carbonate rocks, especially along and west of the northeast structural zone. Drilling of a series of deep holes is recommended. Extensive soil and rock sampling, various geophysical surveys and drilling have been completed on the NAD Property, but the primary target - structures intersecting the lower plate rocks - has not been tested. Surface and drill hole sampling were conducted prior to the involvement of Minterra and it is assumed that the sampling methods employed were industry standards based on the professionalism exhibited by Newmont Exploration, Placer Dome U.S., Royal Gold and Gold Fields Exploration."

      "The Jabiru and Challis oil fields are located within the Territory, as are numerous other oil and gas accumulations and occurrences. Petroleum extraction activities within the Territory are administered on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy through the Designated Authority protocol operating pursuant to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (Commonwealth). Commonwealth laws, laws of the Northern Territory and Ordinances made by the Governor-General make up the body of law generally applicable in the Territory. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha, has established a wholly owned subsidiary, Vulcan Australia Pty Ltd (âVulcanâ) and transferred its interests in each of its Timor Sea permits, AC/P33 (now sold), AC/P35 and AC/P39 to Vulcan. Joint venture operating agreements are in place for each remaining permit. The joint ventures were or are named Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33), Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35) and Nome Joint Venture (AC/P39). Oliver Joint Venture (AC/P33) On February 18, 2010 Vulcan completed the sale of its 7.5% interest in AC/P33 to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited, a major Thailand petroleum exploration and production company. Vulcan recovered $ 4,244,679 for its 7.5% interest. These proceeds were utilized in meeting a large proportion of our obligations to the Braveheart Joint Venture and Cornea Joint Venture with respect to the costs associated with the recent drilling of the Braveheart-1 well and Cornea-3 well. The affairs of the Oliver Joint Venture have now been dissolved and will not be referred to further. Vulcan Joint Venture (AC/P35)\nAC/P35 (granted October 18, 2005) comprises 46 graticular blocks, totalling approximately 3,410 kmÂ² (842,645 acres). There have been five wells drilled in the area, with two having oil and gas indications, all of which were plugged and abandoned. During the first three years of the initial 6-year term of the AC/P35 permit, we obtained a range of pertinent existing reports and open file seismic data.",

The office space is for corporate identification, mailing, and courier purposes and costs us approximately $3,200 in rent a year, which is paid to an affiliate. This $3,200 has been recorded as an expense and contributed capital in the financials. The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Companyâs overriding royalties total 387,721 net royalty acres under 10,610,564 gross surface acres in 11 concessions located in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins. In addition the Company also owns 623 net royalty acres under 155,676 gross acres in a concession located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership and acreage for each concession. The Eromanga Basin encompasses the southwestern portion of the state of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australiaâs main onshore producing oil and gas basin. The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Companyâs overrides are in a prime location since the majority of the Companyâs interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Company has Overriding Royalty Interests in VIC/P54 Permits in the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the states of Victoria and Tasmania which have had in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964. On the 10,766,240 gross surface acres where ACOR holds Overriding Royalty Interests, there are large anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic structures, all of which indicate possibilities for oil and gas reserves."

In several markets where Homestead has properties, there is intense competition for the extended stay customer, which has already affected occupancy and revenue for these properties. In addition, since the lodging industry has historically been characterized by cyclical trends, there can be no assurance that the current state of supply/demand fundamentals will continue into the future. Competition within the lodging industry is based generally on convenience of location, price, range of services and guest amenities offered and quality of customer service. Homestead considers the reasonableness of its room rates, the location of its properties and the services and the guest amenities provided by it to be among the most important competitive factors in the business.",
      "As of December 31, 1998, Strategic Hotel's portfolio was comprised of 25 full-service hotels in 20 markets in the United States, Europe, and Mexico representing total expected investments of $1.8 billion, $172.3 million, and $64.0 million, respectively. Each Strategic Hotel property is located in a developed area that includes competing properties. The number and type of competitors in a particular area could have a material adverse impact on occupancy and revenues. In addition, since the lodging industry has historically been characterized by cyclical trends, there can be no assurance that the current state of supply/demand fundamentals will continue in the future. Competition within the lodging industry is based generally on convenience of location, price, range of services, guest amenities offered and quality of service. A number of chains have targeted the upscale or luxury end of the lodging industry. Strategic Hotel owns a portfolio of \"branded\" hotels that competes with certain of these established entities, each of which may have greater resources than Strategic Hotel. These entities may be able to accept more risk than Strategic Hotel can prudently manage. Further, there can be no assurance that new or existing competitors will not significantly change the rates, offer greater convenience, service or amenities or significantly expand or improve their properties in markets in which Strategic Hotel competes, thereby materially adversely affecting Strategic Hotel's business and results of operations. Properties of SC-European Realty\nThe following discussion sets forth, with respect to the real estate operating companies in which SC-European Realty has acquired a material long- term strategic ownership position, a description of the properties owned or operated by such companies, the markets in which each of such companies operates and the general competitive conditions faced by such companies. No single property is materially important to any of the strategic investees of SC-European Realty and there are no mortgages, liens or other encumbrances against any\nproperties which are material to any such strategic investee of SC-European Realty except City & West End.",
      "Upon completion of the merger with Meridian in late March 1999, the combined company will own nearly 1,500 distribution facilities, based on the real estate assets held by ProLogis and Meridian as of December 31, 1998. The combined real estate assets, including assets held by unconsolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, will consist of approximately 157.5 million square feet of operating distribution facilities. Also, the combined company will have 10.8 million square feet of distribution facilities under development at a total expected investment of $473.1 million in 94 North American and European markets. Additionally, the combined company will own or control approximately 5,100 acres of land for the future development of approximately 87.9 million square feet of distribution facilities. There are numerous other industrial properties located in close proximity to each of ProLogis' properties. The amount of rentable space available in any target market city could have a material effect on ProLogis' ability to rent space and on the rents charged. In addition, in many of ProLogis' submarkets, institutional investors and owners and developers of industrial facilities compete for the acquisition, development and leasing of industrial space. Many of these persons have substantial resources and experience. ProLogis operates nationally and internationally and has no markets with a concentration of investment in excess of 10% of its total portfolio investment. Competition for acquisition of existing distribution facilities from institutional capital sources and other REITs has increased substantially in the past several years. Strategic Hotel\nStrategic Hotel has focused on becoming the preeminent owner of luxury and upscale full-service hotel properties that are subject to long-term management contracts with leading global hotel management companies. Strategic Hotel uses research driven capital deployment to identify investment opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry, develop strategic relationships with preferred operators of superior brands and enhance operating results through active, disciplined asset management."

Based on this evaluation, management has identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010: We did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation for the discipline and structure necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i) lack of segregation of duties over individuals responsible for certain key control activities; (ii) an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control monitoring activities, including the recognition of the risks and complexities of transactions; and (iii) an insufficient number of personnel, such as absence of permanent chief financial officer, with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience or training in the application of GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. This control environment material weakness contributed to the company not having effective controls to ensure an effective financial statement close process such that financial statements are completed and prepared in a timely manner.

For purposes of calculating our obligation under the plan, we have used an expected return on plan assets of 7.5 percent. We think this rate of return is appropriate over the long-term given the 60 percent equity and 40 percent debt securities mix of investment of plan assets and the historical rate of return provided by equity and debt securities since the 1920s. Our actual rate of return was 6.5 percent for 2007 and was 14.1 percent for 2006. The difference in investment income using our projected rate of return compared to our actual rates of return for the past two years was not material and will not have a material effect on the results of operation or cash flow from operating activities in future years. For the 2007 plan year, a 0.20 percentage point increase in the discount rate and a 0.50 percentage point increase in the lump sum interest rate, netted with a larger than expected increase in base salaries and an increase in new participants, caused a $161,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation of the plan.",
      "The assumed rate of increase in future salaries was 5% at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 8.25% at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The net obligation at date of adoption is being recognized over 15 years on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized prior service cost is the result of plan amendments effective January 1, 1988, 1989, 1991, and 1993. This cost is being recognized on a straight-line basis over approximately 13 years, the average remaining service of employees. The Corporation's funding policy is to contribute annually within the range of tax deductible amounts after considering the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and the prepaid pension cost recorded in the consolidated statement of condition. During the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 the Corporation recognized additional pension expense of $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, for supplemental pension benefits. The unfunded recognized pension obligation for these benefits was $3.0 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The December 31, 1993 liability balance of $3.0 million includes an \"additional minimum liability\" of $0.7 million recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87. The recognition of this liability was offset by the recognition of an \"intangible asset\" of $0.3 million and a reduction in stockholders' equity of $0.4 million. During 1992, the Corporation purchased individual deferred annuities to settle the December 31, 1992 accumulated benefit obligation of certain of the participants of the supplemental plans. The total cost of the annuities was $1.5 million and the settlement resulted in an approximate $0.3 million settlement gain determined in accordance with SFAS No. 88. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) In 1985, the Corporation established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust (ESOP).",
      "We do not believe this change was material and project that it will not have a material effect on the results of operations or on cash flow from operating activities in future periods. We also have a supplemental non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain management employees. There are no plan assets for this plan. For the 2007 plan year, a 0.20 percentage point increase in the discount rate and a 0.50 percentage point increase in the lump sum interest rate caused a $62,000 decrease in the projected benefit obligation for this plan. This planâs accumulated benefit obligation was $1.0 million at December 31, 2007, and $1.5 million at December 31, 2006. We believe this obligation will be funded from future cash flow from operating activities. Accounting Matters\nWe refer you to Note 4 - Income Taxes and Note 5 - Long-term Debt in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for information regarding accounting matters related to FASB Interpretation No. 48, âAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109â and FASB Staff Position APB 14-a, âAccounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)â. In September 2006 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, âFair Value Measurementsâ, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 will be effective as of the beginning of the Companyâs 2008 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has no impact on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements, however, it will require changes in certain disclosures. In February 2007 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, âThe Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesâ, which expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value.",
      "Additionally, our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared, therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits, and net operating and capital loss carryforwards and carrybacks. Adjustments related to differences between the estimates we used and actual amounts we reported are recorded in the period in which we file our income tax returns. These adjustments and changes in our estimates of asset recovery could have an impact on our results of operations. A one percent change in our effective tax rate would have affected our calculated income tax expense by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock-based compensation. Prior to 2006 we accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles detailed in APB No. 25. No stock-based employee compensation expense relating to stock options has been reflected in our expense as all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. We used the Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the disclosures required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123. As of January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R). This statement required us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock-based compensation. We have recorded expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock units since the plan was adopted in 2004 and units were first issued. Going forward this expense will decrease on a relative per share basis for all units that have already been issued because the accounting standard requires cost recognition using fair value estimates of the restricted stock units, rather than intrinsic value.

      "For 2005, through a combination of equity for our actively managed retail partnerships and direct equity for AmREIT, ASC expects to raise approximately $120-$150 million directly through the independent financial planning community. Retail Partnerships\nAmREIT manages retail partnerships that sell limited partnership interests to retail investors, in which AmREIT indirectly invests as both the general partner and as a limited partner. The Company strives to create a structure that aligns the interests of our shareholders with those of our limited partners. These partnerships were formed to develop, own, manage, and add value to properties with an average holding period of two to four years. Value is created for AmREIT through our affiliates which serve as general partners of the retail partnerships. These general partners manage the partnerships and, in return, receive management fees as well as profit participation interests. The retail partnerships are structured so that the general partner, an affiliate of AmREIT, receives a significant profit only after the limited partners in the funds have received their targeted return, again, linking AmREITâs success to that of its limited partners. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, AmREIT earned fees of $1.8 million, $634 thousand and $668 thousand, respectively, by providing real estate services to the retail partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, AmREIT directly managed, through its four actively managed retail partnerships, a total of $52.7 million in contributed capital. These four partnerships have or will enter their liquidation phases in 2003, 2008, 2010, and 2011, respectively. As these partnerships enter into liquidation, the Company, acting as the general partner, will receive economic benefit from our profit participation, after certain preferred returns have been paid to the partnershipsâ limited partners. During 2004, AmREIT recognized approximately $869 thousand related to its general partner interest in AmREIT Opportunity Fund, Ltd. (AOF).",
      "During 2004, ASC raised approximately $25 million for AmREIT Monthly Income and Growth Fund II, Ltd., an affiliated retail partnership sponsored by a subsidiary of AmREIT. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company fully subscribed its class C common share offering which it started in August 2003. The offering was a $44 million offering ($40 million offered to the public and $4 million reserved for the dividend reinvestment program), issued on a best efforts basis through the independent financial planning and broker-dealer communities. The Company primarily used the proceeds for the acquisition of new properties and to pay down existing debt. ASC is also the dealer manager on our newest offering, a $170 million class D common share offering ($150 million offered to the public and $20 million reserved for the dividend re-investment program). This offering, a publicly registered, non-traded class of common shares with a stated yield of 6.5%, was launched on June 25, 2004. The class D common shares are convertible into our class A common shares after a seven-year lock out period at a 7.7% premium on invested capital and are callable by the Company after one year from the date of issuance. We have raised $20.9 million through this offering as of December 31, 2004, including shares issued through the dividend reinvestment program. Since capital is the lifeblood of any real estate company, having the unique opportunity to raise capital through both underwritten offerings and the independent financial planning community adds additional financial flexibility and dependability to our income stream. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, ASC generated securities commission revenues from capital-raising activities of $7.7 million, $3.0 million and $847 thousand, respectively. ASC incurred commission expenses of $5.9 million, $2.3 million and $653 thousand which were paid to non-affiliated broker-dealers in conjunction with such capital-raising activities.",
      "This property was owned 60% by us and 40% by an affiliated fund. The transaction was completed at fair market value pursuant to an independent appraisal process. We owned a 3% interest in the Woodlake Square property, a 205,522 square foot retail shopping center located in Houston, Texas, through a joint venture arrangement with affiliates of our General Partner, MIG IV (6% ownership interest) and ARIC (1% ownership interest) and an unaffiliated third party institutional partner (the remaining 90% ownership interest). The joint venture commenced redevelopment of this property in the third quarter of 2010 and completed the redevelopment in April 2011. On February 23, 2012, the joint venture sold a parcel of land that resulted in a gain of approximately $437,000. Our 3% share of this gain is included in our equity in losses from non-consolidated entities on our consolidated statement of operations. On September 18, 2013, the joint venture sold the shopping center to AmREIT for $41.6 million based on armâs-length negotiations between AmREIT and our third party institutional partner that owned a 90% interest in the property. Our 3% ownership interest in the joint venture also included a promoted interest in cash flows once an 11.65% preferred return threshold was me on the project. The joint venture recorded a gain on sale of $10.4 million. Our share of this gain is included in our income (loss) from non-consolidated entities. We received a distribution of approximately $1.0 million in connection with this sale. Location of Properties and Concentration of Credit Risk\nWe have geographic concentration in our property holdings as all of our properties are located in Texas. The economies of the Texas metropolitan markets where we own investments have a significant impact on our cash flow and the value of our properties. Although a downturn in the economies of these metropolitan areas could adversely affect our business, general retail and grocery-anchored shopping centers that provide necessity-type items tend to be less sensitive to macroeconomic downturns."

      "Agreement between surveyed drill hole collar elevations and a LIDAR topographic surface verifies the correctness of the digital topography for use in estimation. It was concluded that the drill database and topographic surface for the Arctic deposit is reliable and sufficient to support the current estimate of mineral resources. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing\nSince 1970, metallurgical test work has been conducted to determine the flotation response of various samples extracted from the Arctic deposit. In general, the samples tested produced similar metallurgical performances. In 2012, SGS Mineral Services conducted a metallurgical test program to further study metallurgical responses of the samples produced from Zones 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Arctic deposit. The flotation test procedures used talc pre-flotation, conventional copper-lead bulk flotation and zinc flotation, followed by copper and lead separation. In general, the 2012 test results indicated that the samples responded well to the flowsheet tested. The average results of the locked cycle tests (without copper and lead separation) were as follows:\nÂ· The copper recoveries to the bulk copper-lead concentrates ranged from 89 to 93% excluding the Zone 1 & 2 composite which produced a copper recovery of approximately 84%; the copper grades of the bulk concentrates were 24 to 28%.\nÂ· Approximately 92 to 94% of the lead was recovered to the bulk copper-lead concentrates containing 9 to 13% lead.\nÂ· The zinc recovery was 84.2% from Composite Zone 1 & 2, 93.0% from Composite Zone 3 and 90.5% from Composite Zone 5. On average, the zinc grades of the concentrates produced were higher than 55%, excluding the concentrate generated from Composite Zone 1 & 2, which contained only 44.5% zinc. Â· Gold and silver were predominantly recovered into the bulk copper-lead concentrates. Gold recoveries to this concentrate ranged from 65 to 80%, and silver recoveries ranged from 80 to 86%. Using an open circuit procedure, the copper and lead separation tests on the bulk copper-lead concentrate produced from the locked cycle tests generated reasonable copper and lead separation."

      "WRI conducts water well drilling, pump installation and pump maintenance activities in Hawaii, and has also drilled geothermal wells in Hawaii in previous years. WRI owns and operates four rotary drill rigs, owns a two acre storage and maintenance yard near Hilo, Hawaii, leases a three-quarter of an acre maintenance facility in Honolulu and a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and maintains drill and pump inventory. As of September 30, 1995, WRI employed 16 drilling, pump and administrative employees, none of whom are union members. WRI is capable of drilling both shallow and deep water wells in Hawaii, and has drilled the deepest water well in the State. Additionally, WRI is contracted to install and repair water pumps after wells are completed. Pump installation and maintenance contracts are primarily obtained from municipal water utilities. The demand for WRI's services is dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii, which can currently be described as moderate. WRI markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price contracts and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with various local, state and Federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes. The Company's contract drilling segment which operates in Hawaii is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. Activity - --------\nIn fiscal 1995, WRI started six water well and four water well pump installation contracts and completed five water well and two pump installation contracts. All five of the completed water wells were started in the current fiscal year and one of the two completed water well pump installations was started in the prior year.",
      "Twenty-eight percent (28%) of such well drilling and pump installation jobs, representing 40% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 1995, have been pursuant to government contracts. At December 1, 1995, WRI had a backlog of four water well contracts, two of which were in progress as of September 30, 1995, and nine pump installation contracts, seven of which were in progress as of September 30, 1995. These thirteen contracts represent a backlog of contract drilling revenues of approximately $2,700,000 as of September 30, 1995. Competition - -----------\nWRI utilizes rotary drill rigs which have the capability of drilling wells faster than cable tool rigs. There are six other drilling contractors in the State of Hawaii which use cable tool and rotary drill rigs that are capable of drilling water wells in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with WRI for government and private contracts. Pricing is the Company's major method of competition; reliability of service is also a major factor. LAND INVESTMENT OPERATIONS - --------------------------\nIn May 1984, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired a 50.1% interest in approximately 10,800 acres of leasehold property on the Kona coast of the Island of Hawaii. The Company's interest and the remaining leasehold interest in the property were contributed to a joint venture, Kaupulehu Developments, in which the Company has a 50.1% controlling interest. The property is located in the North Kona District between the Pacific Ocean and Mamalahoa Highway. The western end of the property features extensive ocean frontage with shoreline lagoons formed by the interaction of the lava flows and the ocean. The original approximately 10,800 acre parcel was divided by more than two miles of the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and had approximately four miles of frontage on the Mamalahoa Highway along the eastern boundary of the property. The land area between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Pacific Ocean is approximately 2,800 acres in size and the land area between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highway (\"the upland portion\") is approximately 8,000 acres in size.",
      "In addition to standard well site surface equipment, we have invested our capital in building gathering lines and water infrastructure, including water pipelines, water source wells and water disposal wells. We have laid approximately 85 miles of oil, natural gas and water transport lines to support gathering and transportation activities on our properties. To secure adequate water supplies, we have drilled eight water source wells into the Santa Rosa formation in West Texas that complement our purchase of fresh water. A majority of the water used in our operations is sourced from the Santa Rosa formation, which is a brackish, non-potable water aquifer that is not used for human consumption or agricultural use but is of adequate quality for our hydraulic fracturing operations. We also operate three saltwater disposal wells on our properties and we have an additional saltwater disposal well in the completion process. We sold one water source well and one saltwater disposal well that we operated to Resolute as part of an asset disposition that occurred in part in December 2012 and in part in March 2013. Recent and Future Activity. A total of 109 gross (69 net) wells were drilled on our acreage during 2012, and during 2013, 102 gross (53 net) wells were drilled on our acreage. We recently drilled our first multi-well pad (two\nwell) layout and anticipate utilizing a three-well pad layout in 2014. We expect these multi-well pads to increase our capital efficiency and intend to begin implementing multi-well pad drilling on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2013, we had identified 1,157 horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons across our acreage based on spacing of five wells per 640 acres for short laterals and five wells per 960 acres for long laterals. In addition, based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data, as of December 31, 2013 we had 297 identified vertical drilling locations on 40-acre spacing and an additional 500 identified vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing. In this Report, we define identified drilling locations as locations specifically identified by management as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data.",
      "All coal reserves and coal deposits shown in the previous table in the column captioned âAbsaloka Mineâ are leased by WRI from the Crow Tribe of Indians to exhaustion of the mineable and merchantable coal in the currently leased acreage. The Company believes that all such deposits and reserves are recoverable through existing facilities with current technology and the Companyâs existing infrastructure. These reserves and deposits were estimated to be 799,803,000 tons as of January 1, 1980, based principally upon a report by Intrasearch, Inc., an independent firm of consulting geologists, prepared in February 1980. WRI is evaluating the acquisition of the rights to additional reserves or deposits contiguous to its existing leases. Estimated remaining tons are reduced annually by production in the Rosebud-McKay seam and by the amount of coal in the Robinson, Stray-1 and Stray-2 seams bypassed after mining the Rosebud-McKay seam. Through 2002, approximately 122,635,000 tons of coal have been shipped to customers, primarily in the upper Midwest for use as steam coal. Transportation is arranged and charges are paid by WRIâs customers. There have been no significant problems with operation of the coal handling plant. The only significant operating problem has been spoil stability in high overburden areas. The mining and reclamation permit application process operates under regulations of the Office of Surface Mining (âOSMâ) and the State of Montana under its OSM approved program. Among the requirements are detailed pre-mining inventories of environmental resources including soils, vegetation, wildlife, hydrology and archaeology. The application must include detailed plans for mining, reclamation and protection of hydrological resources. The process includes an exhaustive review of the application for compliance with all applicable regulations. After initial review of the application, the regulatory authority issues a letter reviewing deficiencies in the application to which the applicant responds by revising the application where appropriate.",
      "The lone exceptions are at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (\"Matterhorn\") and Viosca Knoll 823 (\"Virgo\") deepwater fields where future development drilling has been planned as sidetracks of existing wellbores due to conductor slot limitations and rig availability. Two sidetrack PUD locations, one each at Matterhorn and Virgo, will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. We also plan to recomplete and convert an existing producer at Matterhorn to water injection for improved recovery following depletion of existing well. Based on the latest reserve report, these PUD locations are expected to be developed in 2021 and 2022. Acreage\nThe following table summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2019. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water:\nApproximately 69% of our net acreage is held by production. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage. Regarding the undeveloped leasehold, 1,152 net acres (1%) of the total 169,170 net undeveloped acres could expire in 2020; 5,760 net acres (3%) could expire in 2021; 7,210 net acres (4%) could expire in 2022; 66,936 net acres (40%) could expire in 2023; and 88,112 net acres (52%) could expire in 2024 and beyond. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2020 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage. Our net acreage increased 153,120 net acres (39%) from December 31, 2018 due to acquisitions and lease purchases, partially offset by sales, lease expirations and relinquishments. Production\nFor the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net daily production averaged 40,634 Boe, 36,510 Boe and 39,921 Boe, respectively. Production increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of the Mobile Bay Properties, increases at Mahogany from drilling and workovers, and wells coming online at other fields, partially offset by natural production declines."

      "The porphyritic main body of the Thatuna batholith does not appear to crop out within the mapped part of the Helmer-Bovill area. The Kmcp derives its distinctive character from high-level interaction with the Precambrian metasedimentary roof rocks. More rapid cooling in the contact zone produced a dominant medium-grained, non-porphyritic, granodioritic unit in contrast to the coarser-grained, porphyritic granodiorite lithology that characterizes the deeper main stage of the batholith. In the roof zone, hydrous mineral-bearing xenolithic blocks of the Precambrian Belt series metasediments were entrained by the intruding magma and outgassed of their volatile component. The outgassing contributes to the creation of pockets of hydrous granitic liquid proximal to the Precambrian blocks. These pockets crystallized subsequently into coarse-grained to pegmatoid granite pods that are distributed within the larger body of medium-grained granodiorite. Owing to the physicochemical conditions of crystallization within the hydrous pods of granitic liquid, the resultant solidified rocks show a stronger tendency toward higher proportions of K-feldspar relative to plagioclase and higher K2O/Na2O ratios than does the dominant medium-grained granodiorite. Weathered Thatuna Granitoid The exposed Thatuna batholith was subjected to intense weathering in a tropical or near-tropical climate during the Miocene epoch, while the Columbia River basalts were erupted and the Latah formation sediments were deposited. In response to the strong weathering, much of the feldspar and at least some of the mica in the igneous body were altered to one or more varieties of clay minerals. The depth limit of weathering may initially have been fairly consistent; however, subsequent erosion has left a variable weathering profile with thickness roughly dependent on topography. At present, the depth of weathering may exceed 100 ft. along ridges and be less than 3 ft. in some valleys. Of particular importance is the weathering of the feldspar in the granitoids to halloysitic to kaolinitic clays.",

      "This association with voids and faulting has been recognized at other gold sites and is well described in the literature. The pervasive gold mineralization is associated with pervasive silver mineralization, usually at levels ranging from a fraction of an ounce to an ounce per ton, again with higher grade multi-ounce areas. The higher grade silver areas are locally associated with elevated gold values, but can also be independent of gold values, suggesting a complex mineralization history. Rauno Perttu explored the lode source of the placer gold, and the surrounding region, from the late 1980s until 1997. To date, 323 reverse circulation and core holes have been drilled on the property for a total of 89,800 feet, with holes ranging from 80 feet to 1,050 feet in depth. In addition, 40 test trenches with a total length of 17,000 feet have taken place. DGRIâs predecessors, Magma Gold, Inc.( Mr. Perttuâs private company), Chevron Resources, and Cyprus Exploration have performed the work at various stages in the project. In addition to the drilling, there have been two geophysical surveys, soil geochemistry surveys, topographic surveys, geologic mapping projects, and a wide variety of permitting-related studies carried out on the property. The permitting-related studies included archaeological, soils, water, plants and animals, and even a year-long operating weather station. Two targets, termed Block A and Block B, have been blocked out by drilling to a certain extent on the property. These two blocks have been explored with 82 drill holes and some 25,546 feet of drilling. In addition, assay samples of every 5-foot interval were taken, for a total of just over 4,700 samples analyzed. Block A and Block B are both located on the edges of the major diatreme complex at the head of Basin Gulch. The mineralization itself is fairly simple, with the gold being fine to very coarse in nature, and easily extracted using cyanidation, and possibly other recovery methods. Test work done for MGI indicates a recovery rate of over 90% with a simple cross-current mill.",
      "The intrusive formed a major diatreme complex that is centered on the gold and silver mineralization, which spreads outward from the diatreme complex over an extensive distance. The intrusive event also formed a number of smaller, parasitic diatremes and breccia zones scattered throughout the property and off the property for several miles in all directions. The gold mineralization is found throughout the site near the surface and at depths in excess of 1,000 feet at levels averaging about 0.01 ounces per ton, with higher grade areas and intercepts. The higher grade zones tend to be associated with the edges of the various diatremes and post- and pre-diatreme faulting that cut the diatremes. The highest grades appear associated with voids formed near and within the diatreme when juvenile and surrounding bedrock material fell back into the diatreme throat during periods of quiescence. This association with voids and faulting has been recognized at other gold sites and is well described in the literature. The pervasive gold mineralization is associated with pervasive silver mineralization, usually at levels ranging from a fraction of an ounce to an ounce per ton, again with higher grade multi-ounce areas. The higher grade silver areas are locally associated with elevated gold values, but can also be independent of gold values, suggesting a complex mineralization history.

      "The exploration completed to date has identified mineralization within fault zones parallel to the range front fault. Sampling has indicated weakly anomalous gold values exist over 12,000 feet of strike length. In 2005 the Company initiated a program of geophysical and geochemical surveys over the pediment area along strike of the mineralization. The surveys were following up on the observations of previous geophysicists and drill-hole data from former property owners suggesting shallow pediment. Five CSMT (Controlled Source Magneto Telluric) survey lines were collected to determine changes in lithology and potential parallel faulting to the main Crescent Fault. Also in 2005 a reconnaissance auger sampling program was designed to test for concealed gold mineralization in pediment cover. The auger holes were positioned 30 meters apart along each line and the lines were separated about 300 meters apart, perpendicular to the range front. The holes tested the caliche layer developed within transported material. Gold mineralization is known to leak from sources below and become entrapped in the caliche layer. This system is not widely used but is proven technology in finding buried gold deposits in desert environments in both Nevada and Australia. It has been successful in finding at least two gold deposits in the Battle Mountain area. A total of 175 samples were collected along 9 widely separated lines. The samples were tested for calcium carbonate on site and 31 elements in the ALS/Chemex lab. No gold was identified in any of the samples. The 2005 program of CSMT and auger drilling did not identify any significant drill targets within the pediment zone. The topography is too steep to effectively conduct geophysical surveys to identify new drill targets on the rest of the property. However, the original drill targets still remain. The exploration contractor has made several recommendations to the Company. Amongst the recommendations are that at least one drill hole should be spotted to intersect the favorable host rocks at a depth of 300 meters and a second hole should be placed to twin the original drill hole that intersected 4 g/t gold.",
      "Seven of the ten holes drilled contain gold intercepts exceeding 1.0 ppm (0.029 oz/ton). The second phase of the drilling was completed in the fall of 2005. This phase included 21 holes for a total of 4,940 feet. The Company drilled 14 holes in the Resource Target area with all but 5 containing +0.01 oz/ton gold intercepts. Two of the holes intersected, or came close to intersecting, the feeder structure within the favorable host sediment. Hole IR-22 contained 35 feet averaging 0.072 oz/ton gold and IR-23 contained 25 feet at 0.034 oz/ton gold including 5 feet at 0.096 oz/ton at the bottom of the hole. The drilling indicates the gold is located within one nearly flat-lying favorable sedimentary unit (a calcareous siltstone) that is approximately 50 feet thick. Gold grade drops off quickly as one moves away from the feeder fault. Holes drilled beneath the mineralized unit, even those intersecting the feeder fault, were barren. The flat-lying mineralization appears to dip gently to the northwest and is approximately 200 feet wide and 40 to 50 feet thick. The gold bearing horizon has not been drilled to the southwest. Two holes targeted the Jasperoid Breccia Target with one hole being drilled under the gold bearing jasperoid and another targeting the possible intersection of the northeast trending feeder fault with the Imperial fault. Both of these holes (IR-25 and26) were barren. Just as at the Resource Target, these holes drilled beneath the favorable stratigraphy and missed the mineralization. Future drilling should be collared above the favorable horizon in proximity to the feeder fault. In addition to the drilling, a total of 40 channel (continuous and consistent amount) samples were taken across veins exposed in the upper and lower adits. Sample widths were noted. Once at the assay lab each was weighed. Sample preparation, performed by ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, consisted of crushing the entire sample, splitting off 1,000 grams, pulverizing all 1,000 grams and splitting off 50 grams of this pulp for fire assay for gold and 50 grams for silver.",
      "A second curious silver rich interval occurs in Hole LS11-0040 for 2.1 meters (7.0 feet) from 23.47 meters (77.0 feet) to 25.60 meters (84.0 feet), which returned 397 g/t (11.6 oz/st Ag), again accompanied with only a trace of gold. We believe this silver mineralization may represent a separate mineralizing event within a large and complex precious metals bearing mineral system. Chandalarâs wide-spread precious metal system is hosted by carbonaceous, pyrrhotite-arsenopyrite-pyrite bearing schist. Significantly, extensive intercepts of hydrothermal alteration manifested by massive chloritization and strong silicification of the schist are associated with the mineralization, and are often geochemically anomalous (> 0.05 g/t) in gold as well. The gold mineralization is believed to be mainly controlled by fractures and shears of various orientations within the schist. Mineralized intercepts have now been intersected by drilling over a vertical elevation difference of 550 meters (1,800 feet), with the lowest exposure being in the northeast at the Aurora prospect which is close to the Little Squaw alluvial gold deposit. The metamorphic strata hosting the gold are severely eroded at the higher elevations and either dip to the north or are down faulted, or both. Additional core drilling is necessary to assess the continuity and extent of outcropping and any projection from the gold-mineralized intercepts as well as determine the limits of the mineralizing system. In addition to drilling, the 2011 Chandalar gold exploration program included a grid soil sampling survey consisting of 1,150 samples for multi-element analyses. All of these analytical results are pending. The soil sampling, prioritized to first cover known mineralized trends, consisted of over 1,100 samples collected on a reconnaissance scale grid over approximately 65 percent of the 22,858-acre Chandalar property. In the airborne geophysical survey, approximately 750 line miles (1,246 line kilometers) were flown by an international geophysical contractor over the entire Chandalar property along flight lines 100 meters apart."

      "During 1987, Arctic drilled 1,916 feet in 5 reverse circulation drill holes. Results were encouraging with hole WM 5 intersecting a 5 feet interval of 1,050 ppb gold. The next year, Arctic conducted detailed rock sampling and VLF-EM and magnetic surveys over a breccia pipe target area, followed by 7 diamond drill holes for a total of 2,100 feet. Drill hole WM 7 intersected up to 1,950 ppb gold over 5 feet and WM 13 cut two large intervals (145 feet and 181 feet) of elevated gold in a breccia (164 ppb and 147 ppb respectively; SFPM data). In late 1988, Santa Fe Pacific Mining, Inc. (now Newmont) entered into a joint venture with Arctic after recognizing the significance of anomalous gold in the breccia pipe identified by the Arctic drilling. Santa Fe became operator and, between 1988 and 1990, conducted geological mapping, rock sampling, trenching, CSAMT and induced polarization geophysical surveys, collected 286 auger hole bedrock samples, and completed a total of 52,470.8 feet in 73 reverse circulation drill holes. Three of these drill holes were re-entered with a diamond drill. The total diamond drill footage is uncertain but is in excess of 477 feet. Not all of Santa Feâs drilling was within the boundaries of the current claim block. Santa Feâs work outlined the Swordfish occurrence that extends approximately 2,200 feet along the western flank of Winnemucca Mountain within the current claim block. In 1994, Anvil Resources of Vancouver, B.C., acquired the property and became the project operator. Anvil did a great deal of internal compilation work, prepared a topographic base map and collected surface samples to confirm previous gold tenors. They performed test assaying to determine optimum analytical procedures for coarse gold samples and milling tests on bulk samples to maximize gold liberation. An induced polarization (IP) survey conducted in 1996 confirmed that resistivity highs correlated well with known mineralized areas and delineated two new target zones. In 2006-2007 Meridian Minerals Corp. acquired an option on the property from Evolving Gold Corp. Meridian conducted two separate drilling programs on the property."

      "South America\nChile - Cerro Bayo Mine\nThe Cerro Bayo District covers about 205 square miles and is located south of Coyhaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and approximately 17 miles west of the town of Chile Chico. The project lies on the east side of the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and is serviced by a gravel road from Chile Chico. The property contains multiple epithermal veins containing gold and silver. The Company has been granted exploitation concessions (the Chilean equivalent to an unpatented claim except that the owner does not have title to the surface which must be separately acquired from the surface owner) covering the mineralized areas of the property as well as the necessary surface rights to permit mining. Construction of two ramps to intersect the high-grade Lucero Vein in the Cerro Bayo zone on the east side of its holdings, commenced in November 2001. Additional mineralized high-grade gold and silver vein systems were discovered since then from surface and underground exploration. Production at the Cerro Bayo mine in 2005 was approximately 2.9 million ounces of silver and 61,000 ounces of gold compared to 3.2 million ounces of silver and 57,500 ounces of gold in 2004. Cash costs per ounce of silver produced was $0.54 in 2005 compared to $1.01 in 2004. The ore processing mill for the Cerro Bayo Mine uses a standard flotation process to produce a high grade gold and silver concentrate. During 2005, the concentrate processed at this mill was sold to third-party smelters, primarily in Japan and Mexico. The mill has a design capacity of 1,650 tons per day. During 2005, the Company experienced recovery rates of approximately 92.8% for gold and 94.7% for silver. Electrical power is generated on-site by diesel generators and process water is obtained from a combination of the adjacent General Carrera Lake and from tailings re-circulation. During 2005, the Company continued its exploration and development program in the district with its efforts concentrated in the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde zones in the east and west sections of the Companyâs land holdings.",
      "Chile - Cerro Bayo Mine\nThe Cerro Bayo District is located south of Coyhaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and due west of the town of Chile Chico. The underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facilities lie on the east side of the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and are serviced by an all-weather gravel road from Chile Chico. There was no production during 2009 because of the temporary suspension. Production at the Cerro Bayo mine in 2008 was approximately 1.2 million ounces of silver and 21,761 ounces of gold. Cash costs per ounce of silver produced in 2008 were $8.56. The mineral rights for the Cerro Bayo property are fully-controlled by CompaÃ±ia Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd. (CMCB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, encompassing an 89 square mile contiguous block (23,106 hectares) of exploitation concessions and 18.1 square miles (4,700 hectares) of exploration concessions. The Company also controls several other concessions southeast of the Cerro Bayo District. The Companyâs ore reserves\nand rights to operate are fully-contained within the exploitation concessions and separate surface use agreements from private surface land owners. Exploitation concessions are maintained by annual payments (taxes). The Company acquired the property in 1990 from Freeport Chilean Exploration Company. No mining or processing was conducted by the prior owner. Initial mining and processing commenced, by the Company in 1995, at the Laguna Verde area, in the western portion of the holdings. Mining and processing temporarily ceased in late 2000 then recommenced in 2002 at the Cerro Bayo area on the east. The entire holdings and infrastructure are now referred to as the Cerro Bayo district. Construction of two ramps to intersect the high-grade Lucero Vein, in the Cerro Bayo zone on the east side of its holdings, commenced in November 2001. Additional mineralized high-grade gold and silver vein systems were discovered since then from surface and underground exploration.",
      "Mineralized material at Cerro Bayo totaled 3.5 million tons at an average grade of 4.83 for silver and 0.10 for gold. During 2003, Coeur discovered several new veins names Wendy Norte, Lucero Norte, Javiera Sur, Veronica and Marcela, some of which are in development. In addition, near-surface mineralization was defined at the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde areas. Due to these positive results, the Company has increased its holding of prospective ground by 10% to 103 square miles. The exploration potential to discover additional high grade veins within the entire Cerro Bayo trend, which is 2.5 miles east-west by 6 miles north-south, is considered to be excellent. The exploration budget for 2004 was increased to $3.4 million. Martha Mine, Argentina\nCoeur had encouraging exploration results at its 100%-owned high-grade silver Martha Mine area located in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. The underground mine is approximately 270 miles southeast of Coeurâs Cerro Bayo property located in Southern Chile. Coeur acquired the Martha Mine in April 2002 and began transporting high-grade ore from the Martha mine to its Cerro Bayo mill in June 2002. In addition 145,000 acres of exploration stage properties in Santa Cruz Province were also acquired. Coeur continued exploration efforts during 2003 and focused primarily on the Martha vein located within the 100 acre Martha mine property. The Martha vein, which is exposed for over one mile, is one of six presently known veins that have had very limited exploration prior to Coeurâs acquisition of the property. Coeurâs efforts consisted of mapping, sampling and drilling for a total expenditure of $0.54 million. Exploration was successful in discovering extensions of high grade ore along the strike of the Martha vein within the mine itself as well as locating several new high-grade ore shoots at the âR 4 Zoneâ. The R 4 Zone, and the new Del Medio and Del Medio Norte veins, are expected to extend the Martha mine life through the end of 2004. At December 31, 2003, reserves at the Martha mine total 16,000 tons averaging 0.09 ounces per ton gold and 83.7 ounces per ton silver for a total of 1,400 ounces of gold and 1.4 million ounces of silver. Mineralized material totaled 24,000 tons at an average grade of 78.4 ounces of silver per ton and 0.08 ounces of gold per ton.",
      "Cerro Bayo Mine, Chile\nCoeur continued to have exploration success at its 100%-owned Cerro Bayo gold/silver mining operation in southern Chile. Approximately $4.1 million was spent in exploration during 2004. A total of 250,000 feet of drilling was completed primarily during the second half of the year. The goal was to discover new reserves and mineralized material immediately north and south of the Cerro Bayo mine. New reserves and mineralized material were successfully discovered in several veins. At December 31, 2004, Cerro Bayo reserves were 0.862 million tons at a grade of 7.09 silver ounces per ton for a total 6.11 million ounces of silver and a grade of 0.134 gold ounces per ton for a total of 115.900 gold ounces. Mineralized material at Cerro Bayo totaled 3.829 million tons at an average grade of 4.29 ounce per ton for silver and 0.082 for gold. The exploration potential to discover additional high grade veins within the entire Cerro Bayo trend, which is 2.5 miles east-west by 6 miles north-south, is considered to be excellent.

In 2004, we spent approximately $4.1 million for exploration and completed over 250,000 feet of core drilling. Silver reserves at December 31, 2004, after giving effect to 2005 mine production, increased by 316% to 6.11 million ounces, giving effect to 2004 mine production, and gold reserves increased by 372% to 0.12 million ounces from 2003, giving effect to past production. In 2005, we expect to spend $3.9 million for exploration at Cerro Bayo. This investment represents the second year of a three-year exploration plan designed to achieve a reserve and mineralized material level equal to at least three years of production."

(3) The changes to the Mina Isidora ore reserves in 2005 compared to 2004 are attributed to additional drill data, changes in modeling techniques, changes in mining assumptions and costs. The cutoff grade at Isidora is 12 grams of gold per tonne. Outside the Mina Isidora area, other exploration work on the Block B concessions has included geologic mapping, geophysical surveying, geochemical sampling and 20,000 meters of exploration diamond drilling. This work has lead to the discovery of two mineralized zones, the Twin and Conductora mineralized zones, located approximately one-kilometer northeast of the Mina Isidora orebody. The Twin structure was discovered through drilling during in the second quarter of 2004, and is host to a large mineralized zone known as the Twin mineralized zone. The Twin mineralized zone has a minimum strike length of 750 meters and a minimum vertical extent of 350 meters, and is still open down dip and along strike. Mineralization is somewhat erratic with values ranging from three grams per tonne to over 18 grams per tonne and widths from one meter to over 20 meters. The gold mineralization is associated with disseminated pyrite in a moderate-to-strong schistose shear zone, with moderate-to-intense ankerite/sericite alteration and minor quartz veining.",
      "If all of the workers accept the voluntary termination incentive, we will record a total cost to operations in 2007 of approximately $3.5 million, primarily in the first quarter. In addition, there were 32 employees contracted to fill-in for vacation and absentee purposes, and 38 employees at the administrative office in Puerto Ordaz as of December 31, 2006. Information with respect to the La Camorra mineâs proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below. (1) The companyâs estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on a gold price of $500, $400 and $350 per ounce, respectively, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in-house and are subject to periodic audit by others, although audits are not performed on an annual basis. An independent audit of the 2004 year-end reserves at the La Camorra mine was completed in 2005 by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc (âRPAâ). (2) The 2006 year-end proven and probable reserves decrease in tonnage and grade, as well as an associated decrease in ounces when compared to the 2005 year-end proven and probable reserves, are a result of mining depletion of 114,044 tons in 2006, not extending reserve limits in 2006 and encountering lower than expected grade in development areas compared to the grade estimated in the 2005 reserve estimate. (3) The 2005 year-end reserves show an increase in tonnage and decrease in grade resulting in a decrease in ounces when compared to the 2004 year-end reserves. The changes resulted from a combination of new drill data and underground sampling information, a revision of ore shoot limits and the increase in mine dilution being applied to the Betzy vein material together with a depletion of reserves by mining. (4) At the end of 2006, the La Camorra mine development of the vein system is complete within 25 meters vertical of the reserve limit. Accordingly, proven and probable ore reserve estimates at the La Camorra mine are primarily based on polygonal estimates from development headings and drilling with spacing of 30 to 50 meters.",
      "(2)\nProven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in-house and are subject to periodic audit by others, although audits are not performed on an annual basis. Our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices:\n(3)\nReserves are in-place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery. Mill recoveries are expected to be 93% for silver, 93% for lead and 76% for zinc. (4)\nWe are currently developing the 5900 level, which is expected to reach full production levels in mid-2006. Due to increased data made possible from this development, proven and probable reserves reported at December 31, 2005, doubled after accounting for production during 2005. (5)\nThe changes in reserves in 2004 versus 2003 are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices, which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates, partially offset by depletion due to production. Ultimate reclamation activities contemplated include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas. No final reclamation activities were performed in 2005, and at December 31, 2005, approximately $0.5 million had been accrued for reclamation and closure costs. The net book value of the Lucky Friday unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately $15.6 million as of December 31, 2005. The construction of the facilities at Lucky Friday ranges from the 1950s to 2005, and are in good physical condition. In 2005, we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries. Additions included a third-stage crushing system, increased flotation capacity and a new flash cell, new column cells and tailings thickeners. The plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside trade specialists as required. At December 31, 2005, there were 171 employees at the Lucky Friday unit."

      "FirstEnergy is unable to predict the outcome of such studies. Depending on the outcome of such studies, the future cost of compliance with these standards may require material capital expenditures. Fuel Supply\nFirstEnergy currently has long-term coal contracts to provide approximately 18.4 million tons for the year 2005. The contracts are shared among the Companies based on various economic considerations. This contract coal is produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Wyoming and West Virginia. The contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2021. The Companies estimate their 2005 coal requirements to be approximately 22.4 million tons (OE - 6.7 million, Penn - 7.7 million, CEI - 6.0 million, and TE - 2.0 million) to be met from the long-term contracts discussed above and spot market purchases. See âEnvironmental Mattersâ for factors pertaining to meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating units. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts for uranium material and conversion services through 2008. The enrichment services are contracted for all of the enrichment requirements for nuclear fuel through 2006. A portion of enrichment requirements is also contracted through 2011. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are contracted for the next two reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 1, the next two reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 2 (through approximately 2007 and 2006, respectively), the next reload for Davis-Besse (through approximately 2006) and through the operating license period for Perry (through approximately 2026). The Davis-Besse fabrication contract also has an extension provision for services through the current operating license period (about 2017). In addition to the existing commitments, the Companies intend to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal services. On-site spent fuel storage facilities are expected to be adequate for Perry through 2011; facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be adequate through 2015 and 2008, respectively.",
      "During 1998, Wisconsin Electric initiated staggered, extended fuel cycles that are expected to average approximately 18 months in duration. The supply of Yellowcake for these refuelings is currently provided through one long-term contract, which provides between 60% to 100% of annual requirements under these staggered, extended fuel cycles. Wisconsin Electric may exercise flexibility available in this contract and purchase certain quantities of uranium on the spot market, should the market conditions prove favorable. Negotiations for the supply of the quantity of uranium not covered by the long-term contract will be ongoing during 2000. CONVERSION: Wisconsin Electric has a long-term contract with a provider of uranium conversion services to supply 75% of the conversion requirements for the Point Beach reactors from 2000 through 2004. Wisconsin Electric has an additional long-term conversion contract with a second conversion supplier to supply the remaining 25% of Wisconsin Electric's annual conversion requirements. ENRICHMENT: Wisconsin Electric currently has two long-term contracts for the supply of enriched uranium. The combination of the two contracts provides for 100% of the required enrichment services for the Point Beach reactors through the year 2006. The final enriched uranium delivery under one of the enrichment contracts is currently scheduled for November 2000. FABRICATION: Fabrication of fuel assemblies from enriched uranium for Point Beach is covered under a contract with Westinghouse Electric Corporation for the balance of the plant's current operating license. During 1995, an agreement was reached between Wisconsin Electric and Westinghouse to supply Wisconsin Electric with a new fuel design beginning in the fall of 1997. The 1995 agreement was modified in November 1996 due to delayed licensing of a new analysis method desired for the use of the new fuel design. Current plans now assume initial use of the new fuel design in the fall of the year 2000. The new fuel design is expected to provide additional safety margin and cost savings and to reduce the number of discharged spent fuel assemblies over the remaining operating license.",

      "With the plant modifications completed in 2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its current operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted, additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric utilities. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. The approval by President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing phase. Based on the DOE schedule published in the July 1999 Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start receiving spent fuel in 2010. The Repository is expected to be delayed further as the result of an announced delay in submission of the license application.

      "This yields an average mine production rate of 17,500 tpd with approximately 7,000 tpd of ore, and a maximum of 25,500 tpd for equipment sizing and operating cost estimation. A net revenue cutoff of $12.00 per tonne ore was used to define the ore. After the estimated economic costs and recoveries were applied to the resource model, a contour map was developed around the profitable blocks to represent the pit floor. This is similar to what a floating cone does in a three-dimensional model, but the Nkamouna resource model is more similar to a two-dimensional seam model. The Nkamouna mineral reserves presented in Table 2 are classified as a Proven plus Probable. The mineable reserve summary is based on the $12.00/tonne net revenue cutoff. Individual reserves by block include ore tonnes, cobalt grade, nickel grade, manganese grade, interburden and overburden tonnes. The mineral reserve is 53 million tonnes at a cobalt grade of 0.237% and a nickel grade of 0.719%. The economic analysis is positive at the metal prices of $12/lb cobalt and $3.50/lb nickel that were used to develop the mine plan and estimate the tonnages reported in the following table. TABLE 2\nGeovic Mining Corp.\nNkamouna Project, Cameroon\nMineral Reserve Statement\nMining Operations\nThe Nkamouna Project will be mined as an open-pit utilizing hydraulic shovels and excavators and 54-tonne trucks as the primary mining equipment. The Nkamouna Final Feasibility Study (the âFFSâ) considers an average annual mining rate of 8.5 million tonnes over the/ 19-year mine life. This includes 5.6 million tonnes of waste per year and 2.9 million tonnes of ore per year for an average stripping ratio of 1.87 to 1. The mine plan was developed from the resource model by creating blocks around the resource that are approximately 150 meters wide and 500 meters long. The 150 meters wide blocks were developed on logical breaks in the resource model and are not uniform in dimension. The average grade and value of each block was then determined. Design of the ultimate pit was based on mining the higher valued blocks first with a natural development of the block sequence to allow backfilling of the blocks.",
      "Manganese was found to have grade distributions similar in shape, but higher grade than cobalt, consistent with the strong correlation between cobalt and manganese in the asbolane. Nickel appears to be more evenly distributed than cobalt and manganese and was found to have two grade zones, mid-grade (mineralized) and high-grade (strongly mineralized). Basic statistics were run within the grade zones to confirm the grade distributions and variograms were run to confirm continuity of grades within the zones.
