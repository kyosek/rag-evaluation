      "The gold impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the processing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process. Capital costs for mine, mill, and tailings pond construction can, depending upon the size of the operation, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation. Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million-dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting permits, to ensure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies. Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.",
      "The gold-impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing. Most new gold discoveries contain ores that are not suitable for heap leach processing. Often this is because the gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrite. Extensive metallurgical testing is required to determine the optimum method for treating such ores, but sulfide ore deposits almost always require complex milling and processing plants. Underground metal mines generally involve higher-grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher-grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. An underground mine may have much less visual impact on the land, but the mine design is complex and requires intensive study and careful engineering. Gold processing plants often generate tailings (the residual material left behind after recovery of the gold-bearing minerals), which require permitted and engineered disposal facilities or tailings ponds.

      "In addition, because snowboarding is a winter sport, sales of the Company's snowboard boots have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters. As the Company increases its international sales through VFEL and experiences changes in its product mix, it expects that its quarterly results will vary from historical trends. Therefore, the results of operations of any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, the Company's operating results fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis as a result of holidays, weather and the timing of large shipments. The Company's gross margins also fluctuate according to product mix, cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company's future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts. Historically, the Company has shipped a large portion of its products late in the quarter. Consequently, the Company may not learn of sales shortfalls until late in any particular fiscal quarter, which could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. TRADE CREDIT RISK The Company's results of operations are affected by the timely payment for products by its customers. Although the Company's bad debt expense has not been material to date, no assurance can be given that it will not increase relative to net sales in the future or that the Company's current reserves for bad debt will be adequate. Any significant increase in the Company's bad debt expense relative to net sales could adversely impact the Company's net income and cash flow, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY\nCertain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on the products offered by the Company, including, among other things, general business conditions, interest rates, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.",
      "The Company also anticipates that several large, well-known companies, such as Nike, Inc. and Fila SpA will enter the snowboard boot industry in the future. These companies are much larger and have greater financial resources than the Company, and have significant brand recognition. Snowboarding is a relatively new sport and there can be no assurance that it will continue to grow at the rate experienced in recent years, or that its popularity will not decline. Moreover, the market for snowboarding is characterized by image-conscious consumers. The failure by the Company to accurately predict and target future trends or to maintain its progressive image could have a material adverse effect on its snowboard boots sales. The Company believes that its future success in the snowboard boot market will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to introduce innovative, well-received products, and there can be no assurance that it will do so.\nApparel Industry. The Company is a new entrant in the apparel business. The apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and many of the Company's competitors have significantly greater financial resources than the Company and spend substantially more on product advertising than the Company. Additionally, the apparel industry is particularly dependent on changes in fashion, which will require the Company to devote substantial resources to responding to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner. See \"--Changes in Fashion Trends. \"\nDEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS\nApproximately 85% of the Company's shoes and 100% of the Company's snowboard boots sold during fiscal 1997 were manufactured by independent suppliers located in South Korea. The Company has increased its reliance on offshore manufacturers by commencing sourcing of footwear and apparel in the Peoples Republic of China, India and Israel and anticipates that it will begin sourcing some footwear in Mexico in the near future and some apparel from other Far East countries, such as Thailand and Taiwan.",
      "The price of steel scrap has increased dramatically over the last year and we expect it to continue to increase in the future. If steel prices continue to increase or increase more than we anticipate, our gross profit could be negatively impacted. Additionally, the increased cost of steel could cause owners and contractors of projects to seek out less-expensive alternatives to steel buildings, such as concrete. If the use of steel in the construction of buildings declines significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations for any period. Fluctuating Quarterly Results of Operations\nWe have experienced, and in the future are expected to continue to experience, substantial variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In particular, our operating results may vary because of downturns in one or more segments of the building construction industry, changes in economic conditions, our failure to obtain, or delays in awards of, major projects, the cancellation of major projects, or our failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion. In addition, from time to time we have disputes with our customers concerning change orders to our contracts. To the extent such disputes are not resolved on a timely basis, our results of operations may be affected. Any of the foregoing factors could result in the periodic inefficient or\nunderutilization of our resources and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Revenue Recognition Estimates\nWe recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on either the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours."

      "Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone 3 and Seabrook I. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone 3 is $21.9 million in 1997 dollars, and Seabrook I is $13.7 million in 1997 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Millstone 3:\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone 3, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Subsidiaries of Northeast are the lead participants in Millstone 3. On March 30, 1996, it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone 3 and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee. (See \"Connecticut Yankee\" below.) In October 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it was establishing a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office is responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an Independent Corrective Action Verification Program (ICAVP), (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities. Also, the NRC directed Northeast to submit a plan for disposition of safety issues raised by employees and retain an independent third-party to oversee implementation of this plan.",
      "CL&P and WMECO, owners of approximately 65% of Millstone 3, are Northeast subsidiaries that agreed to be responsible for the proper operation of the unit. The non-operating owners of Millstone 3 claim that Northeast and its subsidiaries failed to comply with NRC regulations, failed to operate the facility in accordance with good utility operating practice and attempted to conceal their activities from the non-operating owners and the NRC. The arbitration and lawsuits seek to recover costs associated with replacement power and O&M costs resulting from the shutdown of Millstone 3. The non- operating owners conservatively estimate that their losses will exceed $200 million. Montaup's share of this estimate is approximately $8.0 million. In December 1997, Northeast filed a motion to dismiss the non-operating owners' claims, or alternatively to stay the pending lawsuit until after resolution of the arbitration case. These requests were denied in July 1998. Montaup paid its share of Millstone 3's O&M expenses during the prolonged outage on a reservation of right basis. The fact that Montaup made payment for these expenses is not an admission of financial responsibility for expenses incurred during the outage. EUA cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the NRC inquiries or legal proceedings brought against CL&P, WMECO and Northeast or the impact which they may have on Montaup and the EUA system. Connecticut Yankee:\nConnecticut Yankee, a 582-mw nuclear unit, was taken off-line in July 1996 because of issues related to certain containment air recirculation and service water systems. Montaup has a 4.5% equity ownership in Connecticut Yankee. In October 1996, Montaup, as one of the joint owners, participated in an economic evaluation of Connecticut Yankee which recommended permanently closing the unit and replacing its output with less expensive energy sources. In December 1996, the Board of Directors of Connecticut Yankee voted to retire the generating station. Connecticut Yankee certified to the NRC that it had permanently closed power generation operations and removed fuel from the reactor.",
      "Montaup's share of the total estimated costs is $34.1 million. Recent NRC Actions:\nMillstone III\nMontaup has a 4.01% ownership interest in Millstone III, an 1154-mw nuclear unit that is jointly owned by a number of New England utilities, including subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (Northeast). Northeast is the lead participant in Millstone III, and on March 30, 1996, Northeast determined it was necessary to shut down the unit following an engineering evaluation which determined that four safety-related valves would not be able to perform their design function during certain postulated events. The NRC has raised numerous issues with respect to Millstone III and certain of the other nuclear units in which Northeast and its subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, have the largest ownership shares, including Connecticut Yankee (see \"Connecticut Yankee\" above). In July 1996 Northeast reported that it has been responding to a series of requests from the NRC seeking assurance that the Millstone III unit will be operated in accordance with the terms of its operating license and other NRC requirements and regulations and dealing with a series of issues that Northeast has identified in the course of these reviews. Providing these assurances and addressing these issues will be components of an Operational Readiness Plan (ORP) to be developed for the Millstone III unit. The ORP for Millstone III was submitted to the NRC on July 2, 1996 and is presently being implemented. On October 18 1996, the NRC informed Northeast that it will establish a Special Projects Office to oversee inspection and licensing activities at Millstone. The Special Projects Office will be responsible for (1) licensing and inspection activities at Northeast's Connecticut plants, (2) oversight of an independent corrective action verification program; (3) oversight of Northeast's corrective actions related to safety issues involving employee concerns, and (4) inspections necessary to implement NRC oversight of the plants' restart activities."

      "A total of 36 drill holes totaling 4,621 meters have thus far tested three principal target areas: the Colonia, Patoa and Tucanare prospects. At the main Colonia trend, a mineralized east-west structure has been traced by drilling for about 500 meters. This trend remains open in both directions along horizontal strike and at depth. Of the two holes drilled this year at the new Jamil prospect in the southern part of the Colonia area, one contained 10.4 meters of 8 g/t gold. The one hole drilled in another completely new area, Dorado, in the northern part of the Colonia area intersected 10.1 g/t over 2 meters. At Patoa, previously announced drill holes SB-04, that intersected 12.2 meters grading 12.2 g/t gold, and SB-18, that intersected 34 meters grading 2.7 g/t gold, may represent the same mineralized trend. In addition, SB-20, that contained 25.5 meters of 1.6 g/t gold, was drilled 600 meters west of the main Patoa area and represents significant untested potential of the Patoa zone. Finally, at the Tucanare prospect, all five drill holes have intersected gold mineralization. 8. Sampling and Analysis\nSoils were taken over large areas and analyzed by assay and by panning to aid in exploration. Auger samples up to 10 meters in depth were also taken in selected areas and analyzed similarly. Sawed core samples were transported from the drill to the camp by vehicle then by truck, boat or plane to the nearest population center where they were air transported to central Brazil for sample preparation at ALS Chemex Laboratories in Goianania or SGS Laboratories in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Final analysis for samples sent to ALS Chemex was completed in the ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada or in Lima, Peru. <PAGE>\n9. Security of Samples\nThe geologist in charge supervised the collection of samples on site and the shipping from the site to the point of air transport. Sample tracking by Solitario incorporated transport records and sample receipt by the laboratory in Brazil. Shipping outside of Brazil was supervised by the laboratory.",
      "In 2006 we conducted induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey to further aid us in selecting drill-hole locations. 6. Mineralization\nGold mineralization has been detected by detailed soil sampling over an area that is at least five kilometers long in an east-west direction and 4 kilometers wide in a north-south direction. In bedrock, gold mineralization occurs along steeply dipping shears in the granite and along dike boundaries of later, finer grained phases of granite. Gold enrichment occurs in E-W trending zones. Pyrite is the only common sulfide mineral but it occurs only in small amounts, generally from 1/2% to 3%. Rarely, galena, chalcopyrite and sphalerite have been observed in trace amounts. Quartz as veinlets and as veins up to 30 cm are most commonly associated with gold mineralization, though silicification as a replacement texture is important locally. Silver values and the quantities of other valuable metals are uniformly low. <PAGE>\n7. Drilling\nSolitario drilled 12 core holes totaling 2,435 meters in 2005 and 11 core holes totaling 1,596 meters in 2006. A third round of drilling that began in late-2007 is scheduled to be completed by the end of February 2008. As of the end of February 2008, no assays of drill core for the third round of drilling have been received. Drill holes completed in 2005 and 2006 were located primarily in three widely-spaced prospect areas: the Patoa, Colonia and Tucanaré.

GAS GATHERING, MARKETING AND PROCESSING SEGMENT\nGAS GATHERING SYSTEMS\nEagle Chief Gas Plant and Gas Gathering System. In 1995 we completed construction and commenced operation of our Eagle Chief Gas Processing Plant. The plant is utilized to process gas purchased at the wellhead by us from various producers and is located in Northwest Oklahoma near the town of Carmen. We gather casinghead gas and natural gas from more than 300 wells that are connected to the system. The gas is gathered through low-pressure pipelines and is redelivered to the plant for processing. Natural gas liquids are extracted from the gas stream at the plant. The liquids are transported via pipeline to Koch's Medford facility for fractionation. Residue gas is sold at the tailgate of the plant to either intrastate or interstate pipelines. Natural gas and casinghead gas are purchased at the wellhead primarily under market sensitive percent-of-proceeds-index contracts or fee-based contracts. Under percent-of-proceeds-index contracts, we receive a fixed percentage of the monthly index posted price for natural gas and a fixed percentage of the resale price for natural gas liquids. We generally receive between 20% and 30% of the posted index price for natural gas sales and 20% to 30% of the proceeds received from the natural gas liquids. Under the fee-based contracts, we receive a fixed rate per MMBTU for gas sold. This rate per MMBTU remains fixed regardless of commodity prices. Matli Gas Plant and Gas Gathering System. In 2003 we completed construction and commenced operation of our Matli Gas Processing Plant. The plant is utilized to process gas purchased at the wellhead by us from various producers and is located in Central Oklahoma near the town of Watonga.

      "The Seminole Energy gathering agreements provide Magnum Hunter Production with long-term operating rights and firm capacity rights for daily delivery of up to 30,000 mcf of controlled gas through Seminole Energy’s Appalachian gathering system, which interconnects with Spectra Energy Partners’ East Tennessee Interstate pipeline network at Rogersville, Tennessee. This ensures continued deliverability from our connected fields, representing over 90% of our Magnum Hunter Production natural gas production, to major East Coast natural gas markets. The Seminole Energy gathering agreements were restructured in connection with our acquisition of NGAS in April 2011. The restructured agreements substantially reduced the gas gathering fees payable by Magnum Hunter Production for all throughput volumes from future wells in the reserve areas dedicated to Seminole Energy under these agreements. Gas Processing. Eureka Pipeline owns a 50% interest in a liquids extraction plant in Rogersville, Tennessee, used for the processing of natural gas delivered through Seminole Energy’s Appalachian gathering system. The Rogersville processing plant extracts natural gas liquids at levels enabling us to flow dry pipeline quality natural gas into the interstate network. The Rogersville processing plant is currently configured for throughput at rates up to 25,000 mcf per day, which can be increased to accommodate production growth and relief of constrained regional supplies. Magnum Hunter Production owns a 50% interest in a nitrogen rejection facility in western Kentucky, used for the processing of Magnum Hunter Production’s Illinois Basin production. The nitrogen rejection facility is part of the infrastructure for Magnum Hunter Production’s New Albany Shale project in western Kentucky.

      "As funds become available, the Como Field will have the highest priority because the greatest return on capital can be achieved by investing the funds into this Field. The Company’s working interest is 100% and net revenues generated through improvements in this field can be utilized totally to the benefit of the Company and its results of operations. Talco/ Trix-Liz Field and Sulphur Bluff Field. The Talco and Trix-Liz Fields are located in Titus County, Texas, near the town of Talco, about 135 miles northeast of Dallas on 2,252 lease acres. The wells in this field produce from the Woodbine Sands at depths ranging from 3,200 to 3,900 feet and from the Paluxy Sands at a depth of about 4,300 feet. Both the Woodbine Sands and Paluxy Sands are characterized by active water drives and reservoirs. The wells in this field are older wells that were shut down and most of the well equipment removed when the price of oil declined to less than $8.00 per barrel in the mid 1990s. At present 24 of the wells in this field are back in production. Energytec believes approximately 35 of the remaining wells can be reworked successfully and the remaining 60 wells will continue to be evaluated. We drilled 19 development wells during the year ended December 31, 2005. However, these wells were later compromised by regulatory action in that they were illegally dually completed. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Talco/ Trix-Liz field averages approximately 50% across the field. The Sulphur Bluff Field is located in Hopkins County, Texas, three miles south of the town of Sulphur Bluff and approximately half way between Dallas and Texarkana. This field is managed from the district offices in Talco, Texas. Energytec owns the majority (878 lease acres or approximately 80 percent) of this Field, which was discovered in 1925. The 26 wells in this field produce from the Paluxy formation, which is an active water driven reservoir. Three wells are currently producing.",
      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur various oil and gas properties are described below. The following table presents the average monthly oil and gas production rates based upon Energytec’s net interest in each of these properties:\nComo Field. The Como Field is located in Hopkins and Wood counties near the town of Quitman, Texas, about 160 miles northeast of Dallas, Texas on 1,350 lease acres. The wells produce from the Eagleford and Sub-Clarksville sands at depths ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 feet. At present, 32 of the wells are on production. Energytec believes approximately 18 of the remaining wells can be reworked with the remaining 11 wells to be evaluated. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Como field averages 75% across the field. Talco/ Trix-Liz Field. The Talco and Trix-Liz Fields are located in Titus County, Texas, near the town of Talco, about 135 miles northeast of Dallas on 2,252 lease acres. The wells in this field produce from the Woodbine Sands at depths ranging from 3,200 to 3,900 feet and from the Paluxy Sands at a depth of about 4,300 feet. Both the Woodbine Sands and Paluxy Sands are characterized by active water drives and reservoirs. The wells in this field are older wells that were shut down and most of the well equipment removed when the price of oil declined to less than $8.00 per barrel in the mid 1990s. At present 24 of the wells in this field are back in production, six are injection wells, and 15 are plugged. Energytec believes approximately 50 of the remaining wells can be reworked successfully and the remaining 64 wells will continue to be evaluated. In addition to existing wells, we implemented an infill drilling program. We drilled 19 development wells during the year ended December 31, 2005. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Talco/ Trix-Liz field averages approximately 50% across the field. Sulphur Bluff Field. The Sulphur Bluff Field is located in Hopkins County, Texas, three miles south of the town of Sulphur Bluff and approximately half way between Dallas and Texarkana.",
      "We have 94 remaining wells on 1,027 lease acres, of which 45 are producing in the East Texas Field. Energytec holds working interests averaging 44% across the field. Oil production is from the Woodbine formation at about 3,500 feet in depth. The Woodbine is a sandstone with an active water drive. While many wells in the East Texas Field have ceased production due to water encroachment, we have studied the movement of the water in the field and have concluded that its wells are in the eastern portion of the field and will be among the very last wells that will be subject to this encroachment. The Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas has estimated that over 660 million barrels of oil remain in the field and can be subjected to recovery by the use of new technologies and operations now available in the industry. The current production from the field averages 75BOPD. The 2007 overhead and operating budget to maintain current production totals approximately $1,700,000. Incremental operating and capital expenditures of approximately $355,000 would result in additional production of 48 BOPD, equating to gross revenues of approximately $670,000. Even with incremental production, the field would likely continue to operate at a deficit, so Energytec will look for opportunities to divest itself of this field. South Texas Field. The South Texas Field consists of three properties as follows:\nHutt Field Property. Energytec holds working interests, averaging 15% across the field, in 13 oil wells and two water injection wells in Atascosa and McMullen Counties, Texas. These wells are located on 1053 acres, 17 miles south of the town of Jourdanton and about 65 miles southwest of San Antonio. Five of the wells are producing and eight are being evaluated for production. These wells produce from the Wilcox Formation at a depth of about 5,400 feet. An active water drive that forces oil to migrate and reservoirs where the oil accumulates are characteristics of this type of formation. Milam Field.",
      "Energytec owns the majority (878 lease acres or approximately 80 percent) of this Field, which was discovered in 1925. The 28 wells in this field produce from the Paluxy formation, which is an active water driven reservoir. Eleven wells are currently producing. Five are injection wells, and the remaining wells are under evaluation for production capability in the future. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Sulphur Bluff field wells averages 70% across the field. One development well was drilled and completed during the year ended December 31, 2005. Redwater Properties. The Redwater properties consist of mineral leases covering 3,778 acres in Bowie, Cass, and Rains counties in northeast Texas approximately 20 miles from Texarkana and 140 miles northeast of Dallas. There are a total of 12 wells with eight currently in production and four being evaluated for production. Most of the production is gas production with high sulfur content from the Smackover formation. There are four wells producing, primarily oil, with some associated gas production. Our ownership interest, including undeveloped acreage and non-producing wells in the Redwater properties averages 50% across the field. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company acquired an additional 2,500 acres in close proximity to our existing leases. The Company has identified four potential locations and began preparations at two locations for future development. The Company is unsure if it will be able to commence exploratory wells in the near term and alternative methods to develop these locations are being evaluated. Hutt Field Property. Energytec holds working interests, averaging 15% across the field, in 13 oil wells and two water injection wells in Atascosa and McMullen Counties, Texas. These wells are located on 1053 acres, 17 miles south of the town of Jourdanton and about 65 miles southwest of San Antonio. Nine of the wells are producing and four are being evaluated for production."

      "Decreased reserves in the Permian Clearfork area were primarily the result of a negative price revision. The Permian Abo area consists of 1,667 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Terry and Cochran Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Abo area comes from wells in the Kingdom Abo field, which primarily produce from the Abo formation. In 2011, a waterflood pilot program was implemented in the North West Terry Abo unit (“NWTA”) located in the Kingdom Abo field that converted one producing well to an injection well. Boaz Energy fully converted the field to water injection upon purchasing the NWTA in June 2016, and in January 2017 installed a new injection pump that added an additional injection capacity of 2,500 barrels of water per day. In August 2017, NWTA 313 demonstrated initial waterflood response. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Abo to have 0.6 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 84% of which are proved developed reserves. The Permian Shelf area consists of 14,727 net acres on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Glasscock, Schleicher, Stonewall and Coke Counties, Texas. A significant portion of the production in the Permian Shelf area comes from wells in the Fort McKavitt and Flowers fields, which primarily produce from the Canyon formation. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Shelf to have 0.9 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 45% of which are proved developed reserves. The Permian Platform area consists of 4,169 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Ward, Crane, Terry and Ector Counties, Texas. The properties primarily produce from the Clearfork, San Andres, and Devonian formations. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Platform to have 0.4 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 94% of which are proved developed. Oil and Natural Gas Data\nProved Reserves\nCawley Gillespie, independent petroleum and geological engineers, estimated crude oil and natural gas (including natural gas liquids) proved reserves of the Underlying Properties’ full economic life and for the Trust life as of December 31, 2020.",
      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur properties\nOur properties are located within the Northern and Southern Delaware Basins, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin consists of mature, legacy onshore oil and liquids-rich natural gas reservoirs that span approximately 86,000 square miles in West Texas and New Mexico. The Permian Basin is composed of five sub regions: the Delaware Basin, the Central Basin Platform, the Midland Basin, the Northwest Shelf and the Eastern Shelf. The Permian Basin is an attractive operating area due to its multiple horizontal and vertical target formations, favorable operating environment, high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, mature infrastructure, well-developed network of oilfield service providers, long-lived reserves with consistent reservoir quality and historically high drilling success rates. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Permian Basin is the most prolific unconventional oil producing area in the U.S. and accounts for nearly half of the active drilling rigs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nEstimation and review of proved reserves\nProved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were prepared by Ryder Scott, L.P. (\"Ryder Scott\"), our independent petroleum engineer. Proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2015 were prepared internally by management. The technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regard to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott does not own an interest in any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. A copy of our independent petroleum engineer’s proved reserve report as of December 31, 2017 is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals to work closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate the proved reserves relating to our assets.",
      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur properties as of December 31, 2016 include working interests in approximately 139,000 gross and 84,000 net surface acres located in the Permian Basin primarily in the Texas counties of Midland, Martin, Andrews, Ector, Glasscock, Dawson, Loving and Winkler. The Permian Basin consists of mature, legacy onshore oil and liquids-rich natural gas reservoirs that span approximately 86,000 square miles in West Texas and New Mexico. It is composed of three sub basins, the Delaware Basin, the Central Basin Platform and the Midland Basin. Both the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin are characterized by extensive operating histories, favorable operating environments, available infrastructure and a well-developed network of oilfield service providers, long reserve lives, multiple producing horizons, and a large number of operators. The first commercial wells were drilled in both basins during the 1920's. Advances in geologic understanding and production technology have highlighted the resource potential of these basins unconventional reservoirs that are productive after hydraulic-fracture stimulation. Technological advances in 3-D seismic imagery have demonstrated the larger geographic extent of the unconventional formations than originally estimated and, due to multiple stacked pay zones, significantly more oil in place as compared to other major U.S. shale oil plays. In recent years, drilling activity in the Permian Basin has shown a growing trend towards horizontal and directional drilling over vertical drilling. The vast majority of our acreage is located on large, contiguous acreage blocks in the core of the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin. The Midland Basin properties are primarily in the adjacent Texas counties of Midland, Martin, Andrews, Ector, Glasscock, and Dawson. The Delaware Basin properties are located in the adjacent Texas counties of Loving and Winkler. We believe that our properties are prospective for oil and liquids-rich natural gas from multiple producing stratigraphic horizons, which we refer to as stacked pay zones.",
      "Item 2. Properties\nDescription of the Underlying Properties\nThe Underlying Properties consist of 35,390 gross (22,997 net) acres in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends over 75,000 square miles in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, consists of multiple, stacked hydrocarbon-bearing formations and has produced over 30 billion Bbls of oil and more than 75 Tcf of natural gas since its discovery in 1921. The basin is further characterized by a favorable operating environment, high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, significant in-place midstream infrastructure, a well-developed network of oilfield service providers and long-lived reserves with generally consistent geologic attributes and reservoir quality. The Underlying Properties consist of long-life reserves in mature, conventional oil fields with established decline curves. As of December 31, 2020, the Underlying Properties had proved reserves of 7.9 MMBoe and 58% of the volumes and 66% of PV-10 value were attributable to proved developed reserves. Approximately 91% of the 7.9 MMBoe of proved reserves, based on PV-10 value, were operated by Boaz Energy. For more information regarding changes in proved reserves, see Note 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Major Producing Areas\nThe Underlying Properties consist of the following four operating areas: The Permian Clearfork area consists of 2,434 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Hockley and Terry Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Clearfork area comes from wells in the Kingdom Clearfork field, which primarily produce from the Clearfork formation. Boaz Energy's waterflooding operations were first implemented in the Kingdom Clearfork field in March 2015. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“Cawley Gillespie”) estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Clearfork to have 1.2 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 48% of which are proved developed reserves.",
      "Our properties in the Permian Region contain 906 Bcfe of proved reserves, representing approximately one-half of our total reserve base, in 5,668 wells. We drilled 354 wells in the Permian Region in 2000 and daily production averaged 130 MMcfe per day. We have identified 1,205 potential locations in this region of which 478 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves. Plans for this region in 2001 include the drilling of approximately 430 wells and a total investment of $119 million, including acreage and seismic acquisition. SONORA AREA\nThe Sonora area is located in the west Texas counties of Schleicher, Crockett, Sutton and Edwards. It is primarily comprised of five fields: Sawyer, Shurley Ranch, MMW, Aldwell Ranch and Whitehead, which are located on the northeast side of the Val Verde Basin of west central Texas. We own an average 60% working interest in 3,497 wells and operate 2,038 of these wells. In our operated wells, we own an average 98% working interest. Net daily production from the Sonora area during 2000 averaged 95 MMcfe per day. Production is predominately from the Canyon formation at depths ranging from 2,500 to 6,500 feet and the Strawn formation at depths ranging from 7,000 to 9,000 feet. CANYON FORMATION. Natural gas in the Canyon formation is stratigraphically trapped in lenticular sandstone reservoirs and the typical Sonora area well encounters numerous such reservoirs over the formation's gross thickness of approximately 1,500 feet. The Canyon reservoirs tend to be discontinuous and to exhibit low porosity and permeability, characteristics which reduce the area that can be effectively drained by a single well. These characteristics have encouraged Canyon infill drilling. Initial wells were drilled on 640 acre drilling units, but well performance characteristics have shown that denser well spacing is necessary for effective drainage. We continue to drill infill wells in these units and, in some areas, the Canyon is developed on 40 acre spacing. STRAWN FORMATION."

      "The Ahafo mine operates on three mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Ahafo to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 13 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana. The Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu is progressing towards future laybacks. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and thirty-eight 141-tonne haul trucks. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of five underground loaders and eight haul trucks, each with a 60-tonne payload. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The processing plant was commissioned in 2006 to process 7.5 million tonnes of primary and oxide ore per year. With the depletion of oxide ore, the current plant throughput has decreased to 6.5 million tonnes per year. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, carbon in leach tanks, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit and a tailings disposal facility. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, an ongoing development project, will expand the existing plant by approximately 3.5 million tonnes per year through the installation of a new crusher, a single stage SAG mill and two leach tanks.",
      "Ahafo’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2018 was $2,218. Ahafo produced 436,000 ounces of gold in 2018 and reported 9.7 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2018. Akyem, Ghana. (100% owned) Akyem is located in Birim North District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 85% of Akyem as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2006, Newmont acquired the remaining 15% from Kenbert Mines Ltd. The Akyem operations are comprised of one mill and one open pit mine, and commenced commercial production in October 2013. The Akyem operations have an area of approximately 15,500 acres (6,000 hectares) for the mining lease concession. The Akyem mine operates on two mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold, including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Akyem to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in approximately 6 years and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Akyem pays a sliding scale royalty to the government based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production. The Company also pays an additional 0.6% for mining in a forest reserve area. The Akyem mine is an orogenic gold deposit that has oxide and primary mineralization. The deposit is localized in the Akyem fault zone and gold mineralization is controlled by a series of brittle fracture zones located within the fault zone. The Akyem mine is an open pit mine consisting of a large main pit and a smaller east pit, connected near the surface. The planned pit covers an area of approximately 345 acres (139 hectares).

      "The underground mine at Casa Berardi is a trackless mine accessed by declines and a shaft, which produces approximately 2,300 tons of ore per day. The mining methods are longhole transversal stoping in 10 meters or more mineralization width with good access from nearby development, and longitudinal retreat stoping in narrower ore bodies or long distances from development infrastructure. Longitudinal methods have the advantage of lower waste development requirements; however, there is much less flexibility in sequencing and in access, should ground instabilities occur. Timely supply of both cemented and unconsolidated backfill plays a crucial role in controlling dilution and maintaining a short stoping cycle. We believe this mining method satisfies all of the geotechnical requirements and constraints and, as a non-entry mining method, has proven to be safe and reliable in similar operations. The mineralized zones put in reserves are of varying thickness, ranging from a few tenths of meters to 3 meters, which is the minimum mining width. Most of the hanging walls are sub-vertical (55° to 85°), with typically the graphitic Casa Berardi fault at the footwall. In 2014, we completed a project initiated by Aurizon to deepen the West Mine Shaft and construct the associated shaft infrastructure, including loading pockets, shaft lining, services and steel. In early 2016, we made the decision to construct the East Mine Crown Pillar (\"EMCP\") open pit, which is just west of the East Mine infrastructure. Stripping and development of the EMCP pit is planned to take place over five stages. The first stage was completed in the first half of 2016, and processing of ore from the EMCP pit began in July 2016. Stripping and development have been ongoing, and the pit is being expanded to the west and is currently in the final stage of development. The EMCP pit uses conventional open pit mining methods, and is expected to run for approximately 4.5 years of production. The average amount of material to be moved every six months is anticipated to be approximately 70,000 to 390,000 tons of ore, with variable quantities of waste."

In 2008, the company sold approximately 70% of its gas under an agreement that included a fuel charge of 1.86% of the volumes produced and a processing fee of $0.11 per MMBtu. However, in 2011, the fuel charge increased to 2.00% of the volumes produced, and the processing fee remained the same. Considering the changes in the marketing arrangements, what is the most likely reason for the increase in the fuel charge from 1.86% to 2.00% of the volumes produced, and how might this change impact XTO Energy's marketing strategy?",

      "Reserves Presentation\nOur estimated proved reserves and PV-10 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are based on evaluations prepared by our independent reserve engineers, Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (“NSAI”). A Copy of the summary report of NSAI with respect to our reserves as of December 31, 2015 is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. See “-Preparation of Reserve Estimates” for definitions of proved reserves and the technologies and economic data used in their estimation. The following table summarizes our historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. (1)\nOur historical estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure were determined using a 12-month average price for natural gas. The prices used in our reserve report yield weighted average wellhead prices, which are based on index prices and adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The index prices and the equivalent wellhead prices are shown in the table below. (i)\nIndex price of our natural gas per MMBtu was $3.67 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013. (ii) Weighted average wellhead price of our natural gas per Mcfe was $3.90 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013. (2)\nThe table below summarizes historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2013 for our 50% interest in the Marcellus joint venture:\n(3)\nPV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Our pre-tax PV-10 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $0.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that our historical standardized measure as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is approximately $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately zero and $436 million, respectively, of future income taxes."

In 1998, these figures are adjusted to $22.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively. Considering the contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. If Montaup's share of the estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone Unit 3 in 1998 dollars is $18.6 million, and the definition of \"owner\" under the Maine statute includes companies affiliated with Montaup, what is the potential liability of Montaup, if Maine Yankee is unable to provide the entire amount for decommissioning the plant, and Montaup is unable to pay its share of the remainder?",

From time to time, these companies re-estimate the cost of decommissioning and apply to FERC for increased rates in response to increased decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee has filed a decommissioning financing plan under a Maine statute which requires the establishment of a decommissioning trust fund. That statute also provides that if the trust has insufficient funds to decommission the plant, the licensee (Maine Yankee) is responsible for the deficiency and, if the licensee is unable to provide the entire amount, the \"owners\" of the licensee are jointly and severally responsible for the remainder. The definition of \"owner\" under the statute includes Montaup and may include companies affiliated with Montaup. The applicability and effect of this statute cannot be determined at this time. Montaup would seek to recover through its rates any payments that might be required (see Yankee Atomic, below). Montaup is recovering through rates its share of estimated decommissioning costs for Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Unit 1. Montaup's share of the current estimate of total costs to decommission Millstone Unit 3 is $15.1 million in 1993 dollars, and Seabrook Unit 1 is $10.6 million in 1993 dollars. These figures are based on studies performed for the lead owners of the plants. In addition, pursuant to contractual arrangements with other nuclear generating facilities in which Montaup has an equity ownership interest or life of the unit entitlement, Montaup pays into decommissioning reserves. Such expenses are currently recoverable through rates. Yankee Atomic:\nOn February 26, 1992, Yankee Atomic announced that it would permanently cease power operation of Yankee Rowe and began preparing for an orderly decommissioning of the facility. Montaup has a 7.8 MW entitlement from the plant and has a 4.5% equity ownership in Yankee Atomic with a book value of approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 1993.",

      "In October 2000, Newmont and Buenaventura unitized their land holdings in northern Peru, folding them into Minera Yanacocha. The unitization increased Minera Yanacocha's land position from 100 to 535 square miles. Five open-pit mines, four leach pads, and two processing plants are in operation at Yanacocha. Gold sales for 2001 totaled 1.91 million ounces (983,100 equity ounces) at a total cash cost of $115 per ounce. Production from the La Quinua deposit commenced in the fourth quarter of 2001. By 2003, production from La Quinua is expected to reach one million ounces per year at an average total cash cost of approximately $125 per ounce. Exploration at Minera Yanacocha is focused on further definition of covered oxide deposits and deeper copper/gold sulfide systems. Additional oxide mineralization was found during 2001 at Corimayo, on the western edge of La Quinua. Bolivia\nThe Kori Kollo open pit mine is on the high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., of which Newmont has a 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Zeland Mines, S.A. Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. In 2001, the mine sold 312,300 ounces (274,800 equity ounces) of gold, while total cash costs declined 21% from 2000 to $158 per ounce.\nBrazil and Chile\nNewmont also has interests in two operating mines in Brazil and one in Chile. See the TVX Normandy discussion on page 21 below for more details. Australia\nPrior to our acquisition of Normandy , we owned a 50% interest in the Pajingo (Vera/Nancy) Mine discussed below. The remaining 50% interest in Pajingo (Vera/Nancy), and all other Australian properties described in this report, were acquired as part of our acquisition of Normandy. Kalgoorlie\nThe Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed and run by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds 50%.",
      "In 2000, Newmont and Buenaventura consolidated their land holdings in northern Peru, folding them into Yanacocha. The consolidation increased Yanacocha’s land position from 100 to 535 square miles. The Yanacocha operations contain the Minas Conga deposit, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2004. Yanacocha added 8.7 million ounces of gold (4.5 million equity ounces) and 2.2 billion pounds of copper (1.1 million equity pounds) to proven and probable reserves at Minas Conga in 2004. Yanacocha has five separate open pit mines, Carachugo, San José, Maqui Maqui, Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua. Reclamation and/or backfilling activities in the mining areas of Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua are still active pits. In addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads and three processing facilities. Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2004 totaled 3.04 million ounces (1.56 million equity ounces). Cerro Quilish is one of the ore deposits within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004, Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region conducted a sustained blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities. Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha has reclassified 3.9 million ounces (1.98 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserves as of December 31, 2004.\nBolivia.

      "In March 2004, Mr. Harvey and his affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with Calais which, among other things, included a more precise definition of Calais’ right (which expires August 31, 2011, but can be extended for an additional ten years if AAI’s right to convert the debenture is extended as well) to repurchase the interest of AAI in the Caribou prospect, including the payment of Cdn$747,728 for the reacquisition, and AAI’s right to convert that debenture before it is paid. That agreement, also defined Calais’ right to borrow against, enter in and upon the mineral interests in the Caribou prospect owned by AAI, construct buildings and mines on those prospects, and remove and sell minerals from Caribou for Calais’ own account. The unpatented mining claims are located on federal lands and are subject to federal as well as state jurisdiction, and the requirements of the U.S. General Mining Law. Patented and unpatented claims are listed in Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report. We are engaged in the location of additional unpatented mining claims. There is no guarantee that additional federal lands will remain open to location, or that the General Mining Law will not be repealed or amended. Repeated attempts have been made in Congress over recent decades to repeal or to modify the General Mining Law. The vast majority of exploration to date on Calais’ lands has taken place on patented claims. Under the General Mining Law, as amended, unpatented claims may only be validly located by the making of a discovery, within the meaning of that law, upon open lands within the exterior boundaries of the claims. Though mineralization has been encountered on some of the unpatented claims, there can be no guarantee that there is a valid discovery on any of those claims. The patenting of mining claims, done with relative ease during the period 1872-1920, is now very difficult, and most patent applications are either suspended or prohibited from being filed. Thus, there is no likelihood for the acquisition of a fee title to any of the unpatented lands, and unpatented claims now held are held subject to potentially adverse changes in laws and regulations governing them.",
      "An agreement executed in 1999 assigned a 100% interest in the right to acquire 35 claims from third parties to AAI for $0.5 million. An agreement executed in 2000 assigned a 100% interest in an additional 43 claims to AAI for $3.5 million ($1.2 million cash and $2.3 million note). Both transfers were made subject to a recorded right to redeem and re-acquire held by the Company and further subject to a note and deed of trust in the amount of $2.3 million, held by the Company. The Company has 10-years to redeem or re-acquire the properties. As discussed above, in March 2004, Mr. Harvey and his affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with Calais which, among other things, included a more precise definition of Calais’ right (which expires August 31, 2011, but can be extended for an additional ten years if AAI’s right to convert the debenture is extended as well) to repurchase the interest of AAI in the Caribou prospect, including the payment of Cdn$747,728 for the reacquisition, and AAI’s right to convert that debenture before it is paid. AAI is delinquent on the $2.3 million note to the Company. No royalties were assigned or transferred to AAI. The settlement agreement had the effect of cancelling the $2.3 million note. In August 2003, AAI and the Company entered into deeds of trust against the Caribou property in connection with a loan for $4.5 million (the “Broadway Loan”) from Broadway Mortgage Corporation, Michael E. Haws, Kemp Hanley, R. Britton Colbert, Accounts Plus, Inc. and Riviera Holdings, LLC.

Application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of a lower price at December 31, 2009 for gas than would have resulted under the previous rules.

Concurrent with the acquisition, PW Tam 19 entered into a triple-net lease (the “GM Lease”) with Green Mile Cultivation, LLC (“GM”) which is responsible for paying all expenses related to the Tam 19 Property including maintenance expenses, insurances and taxes. The term of the lease is 20 years and provides two options to extend for additional five-year periods. The GM Lease also has financial guarantees from affiliates of GM. GM intends to operate as a licensed cannabis cultivation and processing facility. The rent for the GM Lease is structured whereby after a deferred-rent period, the rental payments provide PW Tam 19 a full return of invested capital over the next three years in equal monthly payments. Thereafter, rent is structured to provide a 12.9% return based on invested capital with annual rent increases of 3% rate per annum. At any time after year six, if cannabis is legalized at the federal level in the United States, the rent will be adjusted down to an amount equal to a 9% return on the original invested capital amount and will increase at a 3% rate per annum based on a starting date of the start of year seven."

In accordance with the Revenue Recognition topic of the FASB ASC applied to circumstances where consideration is given by a vendor to a customer, the retail value of food, beverage, and other complimentary items furnished to customers without charge is included in revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues. Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable\nOur gaming receivables consist predominantly of gaming markers issued to casino patrons on the gaming floor. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and the collection of outstanding markers from patrons who fail to pay within a timely manner. Our methods of collection include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts through independent collection agencies and civil litigation.

      "Although mineralization continues downward into the underlying Triassic rocks, it is more tightly constrained to fractures that host higher-grade vein mineralization. The original Trinity silver deposit can generally be divided into two parts: a sulfide zone below the current pit and to the northeast, and an overlying oxide zone. Borax’s mining in the late 1980s focused on a portion of the oxide zone. Mineralization occurs as oxidized and unoxidized sulfides in veinlets, as fracture-controlled mineralization, and as disseminations within the host rocks, including breccia matrix. Sulfide mineralization consists mainly of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, marcasite, and minor arsenopyrite with various silver minerals, including tetrahedrite-freibergite, pyrargyrite, minor argentite, and rare native silver, with traces of gold, pyrrhotite, stannite, and chalcopyrite. Low-grade lead and zinc have the potential to add value as byproducts. Index of Geologic Terms\nMining history\nThe following disclosure regarding the mining history of the Trinity Project has been derived from information contained in the Trinity Project Technical Report. The Trinity Project lies in the Trinity mining district, which had limited production of silver, lead, zinc, and gold from 1864 through 1942, primarily from the east side of the Trinity Range. In the vicinity of the Trinity project, which is located on the west side of the range, there was historic prospecting with unrecorded but presumed minor silver production. Minor exploration activity took place in the vicinity of the Trinity project in the 1950s, and in the 1960s Phelps Dodge Corporation completed trenching, IP surveying, and limited drilling in the area. U. S. Borax and Chemical Corp. (“Borax”) became interested in what is now the Trinity project in 1982 on the basis of reconnaissance geochemical sampling that indicated the presence of anomalous lead and silver in the Willow Canyon area. By 1984, Borax had acquired a property position and had entered into a joint venture with Southern Pacific Land Company (later Santa Fe Pacific Mining, Inc. (“SFPM”) and still later Newmont Mining Corp.",

      "Mineralization occurs, in order of increasing grade, as disseminations, irregular and discontinuous stringer-style veining, breccia matrix replacement, and stratiform massive sulphides. The distribution of copper mineral species is zoned around the bottom-centre of each zone, with bornite-chalcocite-chalcopyrite at the core and progressing outward to chalcopyrite-pyrite. Additional volumetrically minor copper species include carrollite, digenite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, and covellite. Stringer pyrite and locally significant sphalerite occur above and around the copper zones, while locally massive pyrite and sparse pyrrhotite occur in association with siderite alteration below copper mineralization in the Lower Reef. In addition to the copper mineralization, significant cobalt mineralization is found accompanying bornite-chalcocite mineralization. Cobalt occurs with high-grade copper as both carrollite (Co2CuS4) and as cobaltiferous rims on recrystallized pyrite grains. Preliminary geometallurgical work by Trilogy supports this observation and shows cobalt occurring primarily as cobaltiferious pyrite (approximately 80% of he contained cobalt) and within other cobalt minerals such as carrollite, and cobaltite (CoAsS) present throughout the deposit (Upper Reef, Lower Reef, and South Reed). Appreciable silver values are also found with bornite-rich mineralization in the South Reef and Ruby Creek zones. Bornite Project - Exploration\nExploration in and around the Bornite Project by Kennecott from 1957 to 1998 is summarized above. In addition to the extensive drilling completed during the more than 40-year tenure of Kennecott in the district, Kennecott completed widespread surface geochemical sampling, regional and property scale mapping, and numerous geophysical surveys employing a wide variety of techniques. The majority of this data has been acquired by us and forms the basis for renewed exploration that targets Bornite-style mineralization in the Bornite carbonate sequence. NovaGold as the precursor company to us began to actively pursue an agreement to explore the Bornite Project with NANA in 2005 resulting in an initial airborne geophysical survey in 2006.",
      "Weathering has partially oxidized sulfide minerals to all depths tested to date. The veins are distributed within two main sets, those that strike predominately east-west and those striking north-northeast. A large number of these veins have been outlined throughout the modern exploration history of the Project. The major zones of mineralization and their location within the Consolidated Caribou areas are summarized in Table 2-1. Table 2-1: Major Zones of Mineralization\nThe dominant controls on gold, silver, lead and zinc mineralization at the project are structural channeling along dilatational fault and vein planes within an environment chemically favorable for the precipitation of electrum and base metal sulfides. Deep-seated regional structures appear to have been active at the time of mineralization and have played a vital role in the structural preparation of the host rocks and channeling of the mineralizing fluids. The fluids and their contained metals are believed to have been derived either from a deeper magmatic source rock or from deep metamorphic processes associated with the Laramide Orogeny. Location of Mineralization\nThe gold and silver-bearing veins of the project are located within the Grand Island Mining District at the northern limit of the Colorado Mineral Belt. Mineralization is hosted within several distinct veins striking both east-west and north-northeast. The main vein outcroppings are located above Coon Track Creek in and around Caribou Hill. Page 19 of 101\nMineralization tested to date is confined to quartz/sulfide veins hosted with Precambrian Idaho Springs Gneiss and the Tertiary Caribou Monzonite. A large number of gold-silver veins have been outlined throughout the modern exploration history of the project.

Once the product is appropriately processed, it is packaged in bulk and shipped either by rail directly by Union Pacific Corporation and through open switching on the same line by BNSF Railway Company or by truck. Berkeley Springs, West Virginia\nOur surface mines at the Berkeley Springs facility use fuel oil and electricity to produce whole grain, ground and fine ground silica and Florisil through hard rock mining. The reserves are part of the Oriskany Sandstone Formation along the Warm Springs Ridge in eastern West Virginia. The facility is located approximately 100 miles northwest of Baltimore and is accessible by major highways including U.S. Interstate 70. We acquired the Berkeley Springs facility in 1987 by merger with the Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corporation, which had historically used the property to produce whole grain silica for customers in industrial and specialty products end markets. Since acquiring the facility we have renovated and upgraded its production capabilities to enable it to produce multiple products through various processing methods, including primary, secondary and tertiary crushing, grinding, flotation, de-watering, fluid bed drying, mechanical screening and rotary drying processing. These production techniques allow the Berkeley Springs facility to meet a wide variety of focused specifications from customers producing specialty epoxies, resins and polymers, geothermal energy equipment and fiberglass.

However, the company's patent protection for its technical developments generally has a term of 20 years from the date of filing, and some patents may have already expired. Kronos' efforts to improve the quality of its grades and develop new grades for existing and new applications have led to the development of new products and technologies, which may be subject to varying levels of patent protection across different regions. Considering the company's expansion into new markets, particularly in regions with shorter patent terms, such as Asia and Latin America, what can be inferred about Kronos' strategy for protecting its intellectual property rights, particularly in the context of the TiO2 industry's production capacity and demand growth rates?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Kronos should prioritize patent protection in regions with shorter patent terms to minimize potential losses due to expiring patents and maximize its market share in these regions.",

      "Based on the factors described above, Kronos expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for TiO2 during the next three to five years. However, no assurance can be given that future increases in the TiO2 industry production capacity and future average annual demand growth rates for TiO2 will conform to Kronos' expectations. If actual developments differ from Kronos' expectations, Kronos and the TiO2 industry's performances could be unfavorably affected. Research and development. Kronos' expenditures for research and development process technology and quality assurance activities were approximately $6 million in 2002, $7 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2004. Research and development activities are conducted principally at the Leverkusen, Germany facility. Such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening Kronos' competitive position by developing new pigment applications. Kronos continually seeks to improve the quality of its grades, and has been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of customers and increase product life cycle. Over the last five years, ten new grades have been added for plastics, coatings, fiber and paper laminate applications. Patents and trademarks. Patents held for products and production processes are important to Kronos and its continuing business activities. Kronos seeks patent protection for its technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe, and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties. Kronos' existing patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing, and have remaining terms ranging from one to 19 years. Kronos seeks to protect its intellectual property rights, including its patent rights, and from time to time Kronos is engaged in disputes relating to the protection and use of intellectual property relating to its products."

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition), or ASU 2009-13, and ASU 2009-14, Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985, Software), or ASU 2009-14, ASU 2009-13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy, The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method.",

      "Our reserve estimates were prepared by Mine Development Associates. The following chart shows the Black Fox reserves at December 31, 2004. Waste includes 12.18 million tonnes of overburden\nRecovery of gold is expected to be approximately 97%. Exploration\nAs of December 31, 2004, we had completed a total of 398 surface diamond drill holes totaling over 125,898 meters as well as 210 underground holes totaling 41,065 meters giving a to-date total for both of 166,963 meters as shown in the table below. Our drilling supplemented the data from the 284 surface and 720 underground drill holes drilled by the previous owners. A table of total drill holes is show below. The objectives for the 2004 surface drilling were: 1) to better define the open pit reserves, 2) to extend our resources along strike 3) to extend resources in the eastern and western extensions of the main structure, bracketing or undercutting known gold-bearing zones and 4) to explore known geophysical targets. In April 2004, the surface exploration drilling discovered a new orebody in the footwall of the Dester-Porcupine Fault. The discovery hole was based on the extension of an IP anomaly. There are two components to the mineralization, the quartz breccia veins and the massive sulfide mineralization (Pb, Zn, Ag). These appear to be two mineralizing events sharing the same “plumbing system.” Very good gold mineralization is evident within easy reach of our surface rigs and this will be a target for the 2005 drilling program. The system appears to be quite extensive. Exploration Stage Properties\nHuizopa\nThe Huizopa Project is located in the northern part of the Sierra Madre Gold Belt in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, near the border with the State of Sonora, and encompasses a block of mining concession claims of approximately 22 sq. km. Huizopa is located about 17 km southwest of the Dolores Project and approximately 33 km to the northeast of the Mulatos Project. Mulatos and Dolores are both multi-million ounce gold-silver deposits owned by other companies that are currently in development.",
      "Apollo’s drilling supplemented the data from the 286 surface and 707 underground drill holes drilled by the previous owners. A table of total drill holes is shown below. Black Fox Project Drill Hole Database In addition to the above, 69 holes have been drilled in 2008 and 2009 on the Grey Fox and Pike River properties for a total of 13,651 meters as more fully described under Exploration Stage Properties. Mineral Reserves\nOn April 14, 2008, we filed a Canadian National Instrument, NI 43-101 Technical Report, which was prepared to a bankable standard (“bankable feasibility study”). A bankable feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis of a project’s economics (+/- 15% precision) used by the banking industry for financing purposes. The table below summarizes the Black Fox Total Mineral Reserve as of December 31, 2008. The mineral reserves shown in the table below were calculated based on a gold price of $650 per ounce. Black Fox Probable Reserve Statement as of December 31, 2008\n(1) Underground reserves assume 95% mining recovery 17% planned dilution and 5% unplanned dilution both at 0 grams per tonne grade. The reserve estimates were based on information from 1,893 drill holes totaling 338,842 meters. All assays over 170 grams of gold per tonne (5.5 oz of gold per ton) were capped at this level, which represents 0.25% of the assays. The estimated reserves presented above were reduced by mining of 632,000 ore tonnes from the Black Fox mine, including 425,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.7 gpt producing 46,621 ounces of gold from the Black Fox mill, with further 5,531 ounces of gold produced from toll processing in 2009. There was no updated estimation of mineral reserves for the year ended December 31, 2009. This was due mainly to the Company undertaking in late 2009 a comprehensive mine plan re-modeling with tighter constraints and review of the 2010 mine plan as well as the life of mine plan to address the grade variability issue of a certain type of Black Fox ore, which had resulted in an over-projection of grade in part of the open pit ore."

      "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nNew Mexico Beryllium Project - Overview\nThe New Mexico Beryllium Project consists of the Company’s interest in Socorro County and Sierra County, New Mexico described in this report as the Warm Springs area and the outlying hydrothermal areas. The New Mexico Beryllium Project covers an area of approximately 20,000 acres and is comprised of a private lease, state leases and unpatented mining claims. The map below shows the general location of the Warm Springs area in New Mexico. Unpatented mining claims comprise the vast majority of the project, covering 18,240 acres or roughly 96% of the total acreage of the New Mexico Beryllium Project. Unpatented mining claims are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (“General Mining Law”) as amended, 30 U.S.C. §§ 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on public domain lands of the United States upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and New Mexico state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state, and local exploration, operating, and environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances. As the owner of the unpatented mining claims, we have the right to conduct mining operations on the lands, subject to the prior procurement of required exploration and operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of the claims, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulation and ordinances. Historically, the owner of an unpatented mining claim could, upon strict compliance with legal requirements, file a patent application to obtain full fee title to the surface and mineral rights with the claim; however, continuing Congressional moratoriums have precluded new mining claim patent applications since 1993.",
      "PATENTED MINING CLAIM. Patented mining claim means a lode or placer mining claim for which the United States has conveyed fee title to the claim holder pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872. To obtain fee title, the claimant must prove the existence of a valuable mineral deposit within the boundaries of the claim and meet certain other conditions. UNPATENTED MINING CLAIM. Unpatented mining claim means a claim to a valuable mineral deposit established by a company or individual on land owned by the United States, under the Mining Law of 1872, giving the owner the possessory right to develop and mine the mineral deposit. The term also includes non- mineral millsites located pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872. Paramount title to the land is owned by the United States. LODE CLAIM. Lode claims have a maximum size of 1,500 feet by 600 feet and may be established on veins or other mineralization in solid rock. The holder of each unpatented mining claim must pay a \"claim maintenance fee\" of $100 per claim on or before August 31 of each year through 1998. To locate new unpatented claims, the locator must pay a $100 per claim maintenance fee for the initial assessment year and a $25 per claim location fee. Until a valuable mineral deposit has been demonstrated to exist within an unpatented mining claim, the claim may be subject to challenge by third parties or by the United States. PROVEN ORE RESERVES. That part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve estimation. Proven ore reserves are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.

      "Unpatented Lode Mining Claims\nOur unpatented lode mining claims, including those subject to the Arkose Mining Venture, are located on minerals owned by the federal government and open to location, with the surface being owned either by the federal government or private individuals. In addition, the unpatented lode mining claims are recorded in the appropriate county and filed with the state office of the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”). The unpatented lode claims do not have an expiration date. However, affidavits must be filed annually with the BLM and respective county recorder’s offices in order to maintain the claims’ validity. All of the unpatented lode claims have annual filing requirements ($140 per claim) with the BLM, to be paid on or before September 1 of each year. Most of the above-mentioned unpatented lode claims are located on Stock Raising Homestead land where the United States government has issued a patent for the surface to an individual and reserved the minerals to the United States government subject to the location rights by claimants as set forth in the federal Mining Act of 1872. Mining Leases\nOur leasehold interests within our 100% owned properties are subject to the various terms as set forth in the applicable leases. The state leases and leases on fee mineral lands usually have annual payments, royalty obligations, and the term of the leases vary, but for the most part can be extended by production. The fee surface and mineral leases apply only to uranium and other fissionable minerals and typically have a 10-year term with the right to extend the leases with production. Commingling of production from adjacent lands is allowable under the fee mineral leases. Surface Rights\nThe Powder River Basin area has surface rights under applicable laws that allow for exploration disturbance, road construction and facility siting. The claimant must first notify the surface owner of its intention to locate unpatented lode mining claims on the owner’s surface and then try and reach an agreement with the surface owner to pay for damages caused by the claimant’s operations."

It consists of over 2,000 acres of owned real property and is accessible by using major highways, including U.S. Interstate 90. The facility utilizes natural gas, propane and electricity to process sand. Processed material is shipped via rail using the Canadian Pacific railroad. The Tunnel City facility is unit train capable with over 42,000 linear feet of rail. Annual capacity is approximately 3.2 million tons per year and the average utilization rate over the past three years was 64%. The total net book value of the Tunnel City facility’s real property, fixed assets, and right-of-use assets was $28.3 million at December 31, 2019. The sand reserve is mined from the open-pit mine with ripping and dozing to feed the crushing facility. The mine operations are completed on a year-round basis. The silica sand is processed via two steps of crushing and is then wet sized, dried and screened to produce API grade silica sand proppants. It utilizes “advanced technologies” to minimize water and energy consumption, implemented process and design controls to help minimize impacts to the surrounding environment and is working to re-establish pine barren habitat, oak savannah habitat and native prairie plants to the landscape. Through its Tunnel City facility, Covia is also a Wisconsin DNR Habitat Conservation Partner for the Karner Blue Butterfly and is helping to re-establish a bat hibernaculum as a partner in the Wisconsin DNR’s Bat Habitat Program. The sand reserve mined from the open-pit is the Ironton and Galesville members of the Wonewoc Sandstone. The silica sand product contains a minimum silica content of 99% and meets API standards for proppant applications. The sandstone section is mined in two benches to optimize production of frac sand products. The upper bench derives sand feed primarily from the medium to coarse to fine grained sandstone section (Ironton-upper Galesville) and the underlying bench is comprised largely of medium to fine grained sandstone (Galesville).",
      "We extract crude clay ore feed from multiple mining pits to optimize blending capabilities. Crude clay grades are primarily delineated using water loss and loss on ignition testing (LOI). These clay grades are subsequently mined and blended to formulate the facility’s ceramic clay products.

Processed sand is shipped via truck and rail via the BNSF Railway. The open-pit operations at the Roff facility utilize some surface equipment to transport material to a hydraulic mining and screening system for feed to the facility. The facility hydraulically transports the material to the plant for further wet screening, beneficiation, drying and final product screening. The facility produces material for the frac, glass, foundry and fiberglass industries. Products are only shipped in bulk containers via truck and or rail. Over the last five years, Covia has invested in infrastructure improvements (rail) at the Roff facility, production capacity for frac and glass and land acquisitions to improve the resource base. The Roff facility derives its silica sand ore from the Oil Creek Formation. As a local facility, the Roff facility has a built-in cost advantage against sand that is shipped in from outside the basin.

    "documentation": [
      "From May through year-end 1994, the first seven months Devon owned the field, production from the Grayburg-Jackson Field was 234 MBoe. This was approximately 3% of Devon's total 1994 production. For 1995, production increased to 920 MBoe as additional drilling was completed and Devon owned the field for the full year. *For 1996 production is expected to again increase as development continues.* Currently about 50% of the Grayburg-Jackson Field reserves are classified as \"proved developed.\" The remaining reserves are considered \"proved undeveloped. \"\nWorland Property. In December, 1995 Devon completed the acquisition of properties from a major oil company for approximately $50.3 million. All of the properties are located on a 25,000-acre federal unit in Big Horn and Washakie Counties, Wyoming. Of the $50.3 million purchase price, $46.3 million was allocated to 38 producing wells, 16 proved undeveloped locations and a natural gas processing plant. These acquired assets, combined with the small interest Devon previously owned, had total estimated proved reserves of 16.0 MMBoe as of year-end 1995. The remaining $4 million purchase price was allocated to undeveloped leasehold on the unit, which constitutes about 60%, or 15,500 acres, of the total acreage acquired. *In 1996 Devon expects to invest an additional $9 million to begin the exploitation of this property. Projects scheduled for 1996 include drilling development wells, optimization of the existing gas processing plant and gathering system, additional stimulation of existing wells and drilling wells to extend the productive limits of this property. *\nIn early 1996 Devon increased its working interest in the proved property to 98% through several smaller acquisitions totaling $7 million. These acquisitions also increased the Company's interest in the gas processing plant and undeveloped leases to 100%. The property consists of three separate fields located along a major geologic structure. It is the single largest gas producing feature in the Bighorn Basin.",
      "Since 1987, Devon has made four significant acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin. These acquisitions have enabled Devon to obtain prospective acreage in areas in which leasehold positions could not otherwise be established. This large and well- situated leasehold position continues to provide Devon with numerous exploration and development opportunities. Devon has also initiated enhanced oil recovery projects to further expand reserves. Devon's activity in the Permian Basin was limited in 1998 and will continue to be limited in 1999 due to low oil prices. Grayburg-Jackson Field. Devon acquired the Grayburg-Jackson Field in 1994. The property consists of approximately 8,600 acres located in the southeastern New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin. The field produces from an 800-foot thick interval of the Grayburg and San Andres formations at depths between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. The Grayburg-Jackson Field contains approximately 14% of Devon's proved oil reserves and is the Company's largest oil property. Production in this field was first established in the 1930's. However, most of the current producing wells were drilled since 1970. When Devon acquired this property in 1994, drilling by previous owners had developed the property on an average spacing of over 40 acres per well. Additional oil reserves were recovered from similar properties in the immediate vicinity by infill drilling to 20 acres per well spacing and subsequent waterflooding. Based upon analogy to these properties, Devon initiated a $75 million capital development project in 1994 that included drilling approximately 184 infill wells, converting selected producing wells to water injection wells and optimizing the existing waterflood. Devon substantially completed the infill drilling phase of the project in 1996. The majority of the field was in the initial phases of water injection by mid-1997. Completion of the waterflood facilities over the remainder of the field will require the additional conversion of about 39 producing wells to injection wells."

    "question": "A Bermuda exempted company, such as the Company, is not subject to income taxes in Bermuda. However, the Company has a deferred tax liability of $343 million related to undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has asserted the permanent reinvestment exception in ASC 740 on approximately $130 million of undistributed earnings, which means that U.S. withholding taxes of approximately $39 million are not provided on those earnings. Considering the Company's intention to utilize those earnings in the U.S. operations due to debt service obligations and for other liquidity needs, and assuming the 2014 trend in quarterly domestic operational profitability continues, what is the most likely outcome for the Company's tax provision in the next 12 to 18 months, and how will it impact the valuation allowance?",

      "We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2014, we had reserves of $138 million for taxes, associated interest, and other related costs that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. The Company is a Bermuda exempted company and is not subject to income taxes in Bermuda. The Company has asserted the permanent reinvestment exception in ASC 740 on approximately $130 million of undistributed earnings of the U.S. Company and therefore, U.S. withholding taxes of approximately $39 million are not provided on those earnings. Our intentions are to utilize those earnings in the Company's U.S. operations due to debt service obligations and for other liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries that are owned directly and indirectly by the U.S. Company are not permanently reinvested and a deferred tax liability of $343 million related to those undistributed earnings was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014. Inventory Valuation Methodology\nInventory is valued at the lower of standard cost or estimated net realizable value. We regularly review our inventories and write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Future demand is affected by market conditions, technological obsolescence, new products and strategic plans, each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning.",
      "After the valuation allowance is released, we anticipate an effective tax rate approaching the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The release of the valuation allowance has a minimal, if any, impact on current or projected cash income taxes. Cash taxes paid by the Company will continue to be driven by income in foreign jurisdictions until domestic income exceeds available tax attributes. Additionally, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized after considering all positive and negative factors as to the recoverability of these assets. At December 31, 2014, valuation allowances of $43 million have also been recorded on certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions. We have reserves for taxes, associated interest, and other related costs that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are fully supported, we have established reserves recognizing that various taxing authorities may challenge certain positions and our tax positions may not be fully sustained. The tax reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statues of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, resolution of tax audits, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices, identification of new issues, and issuance of new regulations or new case law. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have an impact on our tax provision, net earnings and cash flows. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to record additional income tax expense (benefit) or adjust valuation allowances.",
      "The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The Company will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. There were no significant matters determined to be unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that have been recorded on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the tax provision. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no interest or penalties related to income taxes that have been accrued or recognized. INVENTORIES - Inventories, consisting primarily of finished skylight units and parts for sale, are recorded using the average cost method. Inventory acquired from the prior company was booked at the historical cost of the prior company. EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share is computed in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 260 (SFAS No. 128, \"EARNINGS PER Share\"). Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as adjusted for the dilutive effect of the Company's outstanding convertible preferred shares using the \"if converted\" method and dilutive potential common shares. Potentially dilutive securities include warrants, convertible preferred stock, restricted shares, and contingently issuable shares.",
      "In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income limited weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment. •\nTax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. As of December 31, 2014, we have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that our domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized in their entirety, and therefore, we have retained a valuation allowance against substantially all the domestic deferred tax assets. In our assessment of the need for a domestic valuation allowance, we heavily weighted the following negative evidence: i) a lack of operational profitability in the U.S. Company, exclusive of foreign intercompany dividends, ii) forecasted reversal of existing temporary differences does not create taxable income, and iii) the Company operates in a highly cyclical industry. Valuation allowances of $1,193 million have been recorded on substantially all our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014. At the end of each quarter, we evaluate the valuation allowance by reviewing the factors discussed above. This ongoing assessment is based on estimates and requires significant management judgment. At this time, the Company believes it will not have cumulative losses (as described above) on a rolling twelve quarter basis at some point in the next twelve to 18 months, and it is reasonably possible such positive evidence may result in reversal of the valuation allowance within this time frame. For example, if the 2014 trend in quarterly domestic operational profitability continues throughout 2015, such valuation allowance reversal may occur in the next twelve to 18 months. Until we reverse the valuation allowance, consumption of tax attributes to offset profits will reduce the overall level of deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance. Any release of the domestic valuation allowance will be recorded as a non-cash deferred tax benefit, significantly increasing net earnings in the\nquarter in which the allowance is released."

The hills at the NBP are covered with sparse low brush including creosote, four-wing saltbush, rabbit brush and Nevada ephedra. The project is in the Basin and Range province, but the local topographic relief is only a few hundred feet. Most of the NBP area is characterized by low hills separated by modest width valleys. Beatty, Nevada is the closest town to the NBP and contains most basic services. The nearest major supply point that would support a major mining related activity is Las Vegas, Nevada about 160 km to the southeast. There are several accessible old mine workings. There are currently no other structures or infrastructure on the NBP. Major mining and construction equipment sales and service are readily available throughout Nevada; however, most major mining operations are located in the northern part of the state and are serviced from the cities of Reno and Elko.

The ratio had declined more recently as a result of a disposition program, which will be accelerated in 2001, for underutilized, unserviceable and overage revenue cars. The ratio rose in 2000 as a result of decreased maintenance activity. The locomotive bad order ratio rose in 1997, particularly in the early months of the year, as older units required additional servicing and some new units were out-of-service related to warranty work. By year-end 1997, the locomotive bad order ratio had returned to a level nearer that of prior years. The increase in the locomotive bad order ratio in 1999 was primarily due to the maintenance requirements of units being rented to meet short-term needs and to weather- related failures.

We have not achieved profitability in any of the years during which we have carried out test mining activities at the Nolan Gold Project. We did not carry out any gold recovery operations during 2004 and 2005 as we focused on lode exploration on the property, as opposed to test placer mining activities. We also did not carry out any gold recovery operations during the past three years (2008-2010), as we focused on the lode exploration program. During the winter of 2005, Silverado began an underground exploration and development program on the Swede Channel. Continuing into 2006, Silverado installed about 900 feet of exploration drifts by underground tunneling methods into the Swede Channel. Prior bulk sampling had shown the channel to contain gold in the basal gravels, so the project was designed to obtain a large bulk sample from the tunnel being advanced into the channel. The 2005-2006 winter stockpile contained 8,896 LCY of gravel material, and was processed between June 28th through July 20th of 2006, yielding 939.07 troy ounces of gold nuggets and dust. The Swede portal was re-opened in early November of 2006, and gravel extraction on the remaining sections of the Swede Channel continued until its completion by the middle of January 2007. A total of 8,963 LCY of gravel material was stockpiled from the remaining Swede Channel. In early January 2007, crews installed a portal into Mary’s East, and began an underground drift into the Mary’s East deposit. The Mary’s East project was completed at the end of March 2007 and 9,357 LCY of gravel material was stockpiled from this project. The 2006-2007 winter stockpile contained 18,320 LCY (Swede Channel and Mary’s East combined) of gravel material, and was processed from June through July of 2007 at the existing sluice plant location, yielding 2,811.74 troy ounces of gold nugget gold and over 207 pounds of concentrate that contained gold particles smaller than 1/4 inch in size."

      "Wholly Owned Properties\nStratford Square Mall\nOverview\nOn December 30, 2004, we acquired Stratford Square Mall for a base purchase price of $93.1 million. We are investing an additional $45.8 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Stratford Square Mall, of which $16.1 million was incurred through December 31, 2006, for an estimated total project cost of approximately $138.9 million. Stratford Square Mall is a 1.3 million square-foot, super-regional mall located in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Located in the rapidly growing and affluent DuPage County, a northwestern suburb of Chicago, the mall had an overall occupancy of 90.6% as of December 31, 2006 with shop tenant occupancy of 66.4% (excluding temporary and anchor tenants). The mall has six non-owned anchor tenants: Kohl’s, Sears, Carson Pirie Scott (a unit of the Saks Department Store Group), Marshall Fields, JCPenney and Burlington Coat Factory. Average mall shop sales for 2006 were approximately $286 per square foot, an amount that we intend to increase through capital expenditures focused on improving shopper traffic and tenant sales. Plans to boost shopper traffic and tenant sales include building a new multi-screen cineplex with stadium seating (estimated to be completed in the third quarter 2007), adding one or more junior anchor tenants, multiple sit-down restaurants, outdoor cafes and streetscape retail, new property signage and other general capital improvements. The mall’s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Forever 21, Abercrombie & Fitch, Pacific Sun, American Eagle, Claire’s, Bath & Body Works, The Children’s Place, The Gap, f.y.e., Limited Too and Victoria’s Secret. The shops are comprised of approximately 450,000 square feet and are accessed on two levels, with a central food court. Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop sales at Stratford Square in calendar 2006 were $286 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. We believe that in 2006 the Stratford Square Macy’s had approximately $19 million in sales, Sears had approximately $20 million in sales, JCPenney had sales of $20 million, Carson Pirie Scott had sales of $20 million, Kohl’s had sales of $20 million and Burlington Coat Factory had sales of $15 million."

Proceeds from the loan were used to fully refinance the $37.0 million mortgage loan secured by our Sunset Bronson campus that was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2011. The remaining proceeds were used to partially pay down our $200 million secured credit facility. Sunset Gower was removed from the portfolio of properties that secure our secured revolving credit facility in connection with the closing on this term loan. Sunset Bronson, Hollywood, California\nSunset Bronson is a 10.6 acre media and entertainment property located in the heart of Hollywood, one block west of the Hollywood (101) Freeway and in close proximity to the Sunset Gower property. The property encompasses a full city block, bordered by Sunset Boulevard to the north, Bronson Avenue to the west, Van Ness Avenue to the east and Fernwood Avenue to the south. The property, which was built in phases from 1924 through 1981, formerly served as Warner Brothers Studios’ headquarters and has been continuously operated as a media and entertainment property since the 1920s. The property includes a Historical-Cultural Monument designation for the Site of the Filming of the First Talking Film (The Jazz Singer) that is specific to the building structure that fronts Sunset Boulevard. Similar to nearby Sunset Gower, Sunset Bronson is a multi-use property with a full complement of production, post-production and support facilities that enable its media and entertainment focused tenants to conduct their business in a collaborative and efficient setting. In contrast to Sunset Gower, which typically serves single camera television and motion picture productions, Sunset Bronson caters to multi-camera television productions, such as game shows, talk shows or courtroom shows that record in video and require a control room to manage and edit the productions’ multiple cameras."

      "One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Canada, proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore Hebron field and onshore Cold Lake operations. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex.

      "Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement. 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nAt year-end 2013, approximately 8.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. This represents 34 percent of the 25.2 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 9.9 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2012. The net decrease is primarily due to project startups in Canada and Kazakhstan. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 1.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year-end. The largest transfers were related to Kearl Initial Development startup and new pad steam injection in the Cold Lake field in Canada, Kashagan field startup in Kazakhstan and the Groningen compression assessment in the Netherlands. One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves. However, the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years. During 2013, discoveries and extensions related to new projects added approximately 0.7 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. The largest of these additions were related to planned drilling in the United States and Upper Zakum field expansion in Abu Dhabi. Overall, investments of $25.3 billion were made by the Corporation during 2013 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $22.7 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional $2.6 billion for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves.",
      "The largest transfers were related to Kearl Expansion project start-up and drilling activity in the United States. Mainly due to low prices during 2015, the Corporation reclassified approximately 1 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves, primarily natural gas reserves in the United States, which no longer meet the SEC definition of proved reserves. One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.

However, the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years. During 2015, extensions and purchases primarily related to United States unconventional and Abu Dhabi drilling added approximately 1.7 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Overall, investments of $19.4 billion were made by the Corporation during 2015 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $17 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional $2.4 billion for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments represented 76 percent of the $25.4 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

During the third quarter, 2013, a total of 11,680 feet were drilled at 16 hole locations using reverse circulation air rotary methods. The drill program was designed to provide proof of concept information on the exploration model for the area and define mineralized zones worthy of resource definition drilling. The results of the 2012 Phase I drill program indicated that three areas merit additional exploration based on the following:\n1) Sediment hosted gold mineralization without significant lead-zinc grade is present on the property. Drill hole PRC 10 intercepted 190 feet of mineralization at 630 feet of depth grading 0.04 opt gold and 1.5 opt silver. Fifty feet of the intercept was oxidized while the remainder was in sulfides. Two other drill holes, PRC 19 and PRC 25 intercepted from 10 to 40 feet of gold mineralization grading 0.07 to 0.08 opt with 0.9 opt silver.",

      "Ownership of the remaining 50% interest is divided between the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine, each a state entity of Uzbekistan. The joint venture produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide material from the nearby government-owned Muruntau mine, located in the Kyzylkum Desert. The gold produced by Zarafshan-Newmont is sold in international markets for U.S. dollars. Zarafshan-Newmont sold 218,100 equity ounces of gold in 2003. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan-Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 242.5 million tons of ore to Zarafshan-\nNewmont from various areas of the stockpiles designated into four different “Zones” under the agreement. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 124.3 million tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 118.2 million tons to be delivered (8.9 million tons from Zone 3 and 109.3 million tons from Zone 4). Initially, ore from all Zones was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In May 2003, the parties amended the grade and pricing structure of the ore supply agreement with respect to ore to be delivered from Zone 4. Under the May 2003 amendment the parties have agreed to a mine plan designed to achieve an average grade of at least 0.036 ounce of gold per ton for ore from Zone 4. The amount paid for this ore is dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period in which the ore is processed. In the event the State Committee and Navoi supply ore from Zone 4 having an average grade less than 0.036 ounce per ton in a given month and the average gold price during such month is less than $320 per ounce, the price of such ore will be discounted. At certain combinations of low ore grade and at gold prices less than $320 per ounce, the computed price may result in a credit to Zarafshan-Newmont, which will be offset against free cash distributions or future ore purchase payments due to the State Committee and Navoi.",
      "In accordance with its Contract of Work, Newmont made an offer of a 3% interest in Minahasa in 2002, but received no interest in the offer due in large part, we believe, to the imminent closure of the operation. Uzbekistan\nNewmont has a 50% interest in the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture in Uzbekistan. Ownership of the remaining 50% interest is divided between the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources and Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine, each a state entity of Uzbekistan. The joint venture produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide ore from the nearby government-owned Muruntau mine, located in the Kyzylkum Desert. The gold produced by Zarafshan-Newmont is sold in international markets for U.S. dollars. Zarafshan-Newmont sold 511,600 ounces (255,800 of equity ounces) of gold in 2002. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan-Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 220 million metric tons of ore to Zarafshan-Newmont. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 98.1 million metric tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 121.9 million metric tons. Initially, ore was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In 2000, however, the ore supply agreement was amended to modify the required grades and pricing structure. Under the 2000 amendment, the grade of ore that the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to provide is dependent on the forecasted gold price as determined by the board of directors of Zarafshan-Newmont, and the price is dependent on the average gold price during the period the ore is processed. Thus, at higher gold prices, the State Committee and Navoi may deliver lower grade ore, but receive a higher price. In October 2002, the parties reached tentative agreement to further amend the ore supply agreement. Under the new amendment, the pricing terms for approximately 99.5 million metric tons of the remaining 121.9 million metric tons will be determined by a formula whereby the amount paid for ore is dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period which the ore is processed."

      "On May 19, 1995, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 955,864 Common Shares relating to Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-II Partnership units and up to 310,000 Common Shares issued in one of SCI's prior private placement offerings; such registration statement was declared effective on June 26, 1995. Through December 31, 1997, limited partners had exchanged 555,654 of their Partnership units in SCI Limited Partnership-II for 555,651 Common Shares (and cash payments for partial units). As a result of these conversions and additional capital contributions by SCI, SCI's general partnership interest increased from 81.2% to 97.6% and 90,213 limited partnership units remain outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-II. Limited partners are also entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreement, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, SCI as general partner is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale. SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV\nOn October 28, 1994, SCI acquired $91.7 million of additional properties and related assets through two Partnerships, SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV.",
      "SCI Limited Partnership-IV contained approximately $81 million of properties and related assets at December 31, 1997, and is structured as a distinct entity to maintain the credit rating of the secured notes assumed by such Partnership. A total of 583,512 limited partnership units were issued by these two Partnerships to certain previously unaffiliated parties. SCI contributed $35.4 million of cash to these Partnerships in 1994 to retire debt, pay part of the aggregate property purchase price, make capital improvements and pay closing costs. $47.1 million of mortgage debt was assumed by these\nPartnerships. During 1995, SCI contributed an additional $11.9 million to SCI Limited Partnership-III for property acquisitions which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 50.4% to 71.8%. In 1996, SCI contributed $4.2 million to SCI Limited Partnership III in connection with property acquisition. In the aggregate, these contributions increased SCI's general partnership interest from 71.8% to 75.6%. On October 23, 1997, SCI filed a registration statement to register the resale of 583,508 Common Shares issuable upon exchange of SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV units. The registration statement was declared effective on November 6, 1997. In the fourth quarter of 1997, 105,000 partnership units were converted to 105,000 SCI Common Shares, bringing SCI's general partnership interest to 80.6% at December 31, 1997. During 1996 and 1997, SCI contributed $2.5 million to SCI Limited Partnership IV in connection with tax deferred exchanges of real estate which increased SCI's general partnership interest from 96.36% to 96.65% at December 31, 1997. There were 409,900 and 68,612 partnership units outstanding in SCI Limited Partnership-III and SCI Limited Partnership-IV, respectively, at December 31, 1997. The Partnership agreements for these Partnerships are substantially similar to the Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II and permit holders of limited partnership units to exchange each unit for a Common Share beginning on October 29, 1995.",
      "SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, has complete discretion and control with respect to all management matters, including disposition of assets, except for certain restrictions on the retirement of assumed debt. Limited partners are entitled to fully cumulative quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid in respect of a Common Share and any unpaid distributions will bear interest at prime plus 1%. Until the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares, limited partners are entitled to receive all cumulated and unpaid distributions (together with interest thereon). After the 10th anniversary of the date of the Partnership agreements, limited partners are not entitled to receive cumulated and unpaid distributions (or interest thereon) upon any exchange of Partnership units for Common Shares unless the fair market value of a Common Share for which a unit is exchangeable is less than 110% of the amount paid by a limited partner for a unit. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner. In the event that the Partnerships sell any of their respective properties, SCI or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, as general partner, is entitled to a distribution of all net proceeds from such sale, except (during the first 10 years of the Partnerships only) to the extent of unpaid distributions and interest thereon. SCI DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\nSCI Development Services Incorporated (\"SCI Development Services\") was incorporated in Delaware in August 1994 for the purpose of acquiring, developing, operating, and selling distribution space facilities either for its own account or for third parties. SCI owns 100% of the nonvoting preferred stock of SCI Development Services and an unaffiliated third party owns 100% of the voting common stock and, as a result, SCI has no control over the operations of SCI Development Services.",
      "Additionally, the limited partners are entitled to receive fully cumulative quarterly distributions per Partnership unit equal to the quarterly distributions payable in respect of Common Shares. In the event that the Partnership sells any of its properties, limited partners are entitled to a pro rata distribution of the net proceeds of such sale, with a corresponding downward adjustment in the number of Common Shares for which a unit may be exchanged. Each limited partner has agreed that, from and after the time that such limited partner has exercised its right to exchange a Partnership unit for a Common Share and for a period of four years after the date of the Partnership agreement, the limited partner will not, during any calendar year, sell Common Shares owned by the limited partner if such sale would exceed 33% of the aggregate number of Partnership units and Common Shares outstanding on the date of the Partnership agreement. All cash flow available after payment of distributions to limited partners will be distributed to SCI, as general partner. SCI Limited Partnership-II\nIn exchange for approximately 645,867 Partnership units, the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II contributed the following properties: (i) 437,542 square feet of industrial property in SCI's Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas target market; (ii) 217,504 square feet in SCI's Austin, Texas target market; (iii) 132,605 square feet in SCI's San Francisco (East Bay Area), California target market; (iv) 51,750 square feet in SCI's Denver, Colorado target market; (v) 493,894 square feet in SCI's Charlotte, North Carolina target market; and (vi) 270,000 square feet in SCI's El Paso, Texas target market. The foregoing properties had an aggregate purchase price to SCI of $45.5 million. None of the limited partners of SCI Limited Partnership-II is affiliated with SCI. The Partnership agreement governing SCI Limited Partnership-II granted to limited partners the right to exchange each Partnership unit for a Common Share beginning on February 15, 1995.",
      "Distributions by the Operating Partnership with respect to Preferred Units and Common Units provide the funds to enable the Company to make distributions to the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock. The partnership agreement also provides that, after the June 30 or December 31 next succeeding the first anniversary of any issuance of Common Units (or earlier in the event of certain extraordinary transactions), each holder of Common Units other than the Company will have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem its Common Units at a per unit redemption price equal to the then market value of a share of Common Stock. Such redemption will be in cash, except that the Company may assume the redemption obligation and pay the redemption in form of shares of its Common Stock. During 1999, approximately 297,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately 297,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During 1998, approximately 41,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately $596,000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for issuance upon the potential redemption of approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 partnership units, respectively. UNISSUED REGISTERED SECURITIES: At December 31, 1999, the Company had registered for issuance an aggregate of $202,144,000 of unissued securities under various shelf registration statements. 9. PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK\nMARKET QUOTATIONS\nMarket quotations are from the New York Stock Exchange. At December 31, 1999, there were 2,156 holders of record of the Company's shares. 10. STOCK OPTIONS The Company has a stock option and incentive plan which expires in 2006 and is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A maximum of 2,950,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options or other stock-based awards that may be granted under the plan."

      "Obvious extensions of drilling, soil and rock gold anomalies and high grade veins in old workings suggest not only an excellent chance of increasing the known resource of open pit mineralization but of finding a world class bonanza gold/silver deposit at depth. The vast majority of the previous resource drilling was vertical and did not test for these potentially higher grade fault zones. During 2005 the Company undertook an exploration program on the Hercules Property. The program consisted of geologic mapping, geochemical sampling, compilation of previous drilling data, and a re-evaluation of geophysical surveys. Also, a total of 105 soil samples were collected on the north end of the property. The geophysical targets on the northern portion of the claim block were reviewed and evaluated. The information developed from previous exploration groups was combined with new information from the geophysical surveys and recent mapping to place 7 reverse circulation holes to determine strike, dip and stratigraphy within the A, B, C, West Cliffs and Bread Loaves mineralized zones. The structures believed to be present in these areas would provide a pathway for mineral rich fluids. The fluids should pond within certain porous rock types below impermeable stratigraphy. Six drill holes were located on the margins of the previously defined mineralized zones. The seventh hole tested a parallel alteration zone to the west of any previous drilling. Seven drill holes were completed for 2,470 feet (753 m). The drilling extended the known precious metals mineralization near surface and between pods A-C. The holes also defined several fault zones that fed these mineralized areas. Generally, the fault zones were encountered within an impermeable mudstone unit. The faults were represented by bleaching, iron oxide and clay alteration within the mudstone. The faults were 3 to 8 meters wide and contained anomalous gold values in the 0.01 to 0.05 g/t range. It is believed that this mudstone unit restricted the flow of mineralizing fluids and may have caused ponding of the fluids at its base."

The following describes the properties in which the Partnership owns an interest as of December 31, 1995. The Charlotte Property\nOn May 9, 1988, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture acquired a two-story building containing approximately 70,752 net leasable square feet, located on a 9.54 acre tract of land located in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (the \"Charlotte Property\") for a purchase price of $8,550,000. While the entire project was originally leased under a net lease to IBM, IBM elected not to exercise its second three year option to extend its lease and vacated the building effective September 30, 1993, after paying a $425,000 lease termination fee. On May 1, 1994, First Union Bank assumed occupancy of the Charlotte property under a lease which expires April 30, 2001. The principal terms of the lease provide for First Union's sole tenancy of the project as a regional operations center for the initial term of seven years. Because First Union Bank invested approximately $1 million in tenant improvements at the Charlotte property, a lower rental rate was accepted for the first five years. There are presently no plans for improvement or further development of the project. The annual base rent during the initial term is $412,705 payable in equal monthly installments of $34,392.08 during the first two years, annual base rent of $454,651 payable in equal monthly installments of $37,887.58 during the third year, annual base rent of $489,650 payable in equal monthly installments of $40,804 during the fourth year and annual base rent of $524,625 payable in equal monthly installments of $43,718.75 during the fifth year. Rental rates during the remaining two years of the lease term will be determined by market rates.

THE ATRIUM/FUND II - FUND III JOINT VENTURE - -------------------------------------------\nOn April 3, 1989, the Fund II-Fund II-OW Joint Venture formed a joint venture (the \"Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture\") with Wells Real Estate Fund III, L.P. (\"Wells Fund III\"), a public Georgia limited partnership affiliated with the Partnership through common general partners. The investment objectives of Wells Fund III are substantially identical to those of the Partnership. In April 1989, the Fund II-Fund III Joint Venture acquired a four-story office building located on a 5.6 acre tract of land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center in metropolitan Houston, in the City of Nassau Bay, Harris County, Texas, know as \"The Atrium at Nassau Bay\" (the \"Atrium\")."

    "question": "The Bajo Pobré project's geology and mineralization are closely tied to the regional climate and geography. What are the primary environmental concerns associated with the overpopulation of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos in the Patagonia region, and how might these concerns impact the development of wind power generating stations in the area?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The overpopulation of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos poses a significant threat to the local ecosystem, as it can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, and water pollution. This, in turn, may hinder the development of wind power generating stations in the area due to the need for more extensive environmental impact assessments and mitigation measures.",
      "B) The overpopulation of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos is primarily a concern for the local economy, as it can lead to increased competition for resources and decreased tourism revenue. This, in turn, may impact the development of wind power generating stations in the area due to the need for more effective conservation strategies and sustainable resource management.",
      "C) The overpopulation of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos is a minor issue, as it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the local ecosystem or the development of wind power generating stations. This, in turn, may allow for more rapid development of wind power generating stations in the area, without the need for extensive environmental impact assessments.",
      "D) The overpopulation of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos is a result of the changing climate and weather patterns in the Patagonia region, which have led to a decline in the local economy and an increase in the number of wild guanacos, ostriches, and flamingos. This, in turn, may impact the development of wind power generating stations in the area due to the need for more efficient power generation systems and increased energy demand."

The nearest farms are Los Ventisqueros, Maria Esther, Las Vallas, La Florentina, La Laguna, La Josefina and Piedra Labrada. The local economy was formerly based largely on sheep herding and marine fishing but in the late-1980s, sheep herding began a steep decline because of the Hudson volcano eruption and a descending economy; for those reasons many of the former large sheep farms are now unoccupied and in disrepair. The prolific sheep herds have since been replaced by overpopulated herds of wild guanacos, ostriches and flamingos (in the playas). One hundred km southeast of the property is the gold-silver epithermal Cerro Vanguardia Mine owned by AngloGold Ashanti Limited and Fomicruz. Away from the towns and villages in Patagonia there are few power grids and scant telephone service. The many mineral exploration and development camps scattered widely throughout the Deseado Massif typically rely on diesel or gasoline generators for electrical power and satellite phones or radios for communications. Some communities in the region now have wind power generating stations and experimental hydrogen plants (Pico Truncado for example) and it is possible such stations might someday be utilized in mining camps to supplement their power requirements. However, the recent effort by the Santa Cruz Provincial Government to pave the Provincial Route 12, which runs within several kilometers of the project, may also include the construction of a power line which runs along the highway. Manpower is available in the larger communities to serve most exploration or mining operations.

      "The PUCO may cause the Ohio Companies to undertake, no more often than annually, a similar competitive bid process to secure generation for the years 2007 and 2008. Any acceptance of future competitive bid results would terminate the Rate Stabilization Plan pricing, but not the related approved accounting, and not until twelve months after the PUCO authorizes such termination. NJBPU Rate Matters\nJCP&L is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under NUG agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of December 31, 2004, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $446 million. New Jersey law allows for securitization of JCP&L's deferred balance upon application by JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey restructuring legislation are met. On February 14, 2003, JCP&L filed for approval of the securitization of the deferred balance. There can be no assurance as to the extent, if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization. In July 2003, the NJBPU announced its JCP&L base electric rate proceeding decision, which reduced JCP&L's annual revenues effective August 1, 2003 and disallowed $153 million of deferred energy costs. The NJBPU decision also provided for an interim return on equity of 9.5% on JCP&L's rate base. The decision ordered a Phase II proceeding be conducted to review whether JCP&L is in compliance with current service reliability and quality standards. The BPU also ordered that any expenditures and projects undertaken by JCP&L to increase its system's reliability will be reviewed as part of the Phase II proceeding, to determine their prudence and reasonableness for rate recovery. In that Phase II proceeding, the NJBPU could increase JCP&L’s return on equity to 9.75% or decrease it to 9.25%, depending on its assessment of the reliability of JCP&L's service. Any reduction would be retroactive to August 1, 2003.",
      "PUCO Rate Matters\nIn October 2003, the Ohio Companies filed an application for a Rate Stabilization Plan with the PUCO to establish generation service rates beginning January 1, 2006, in response to PUCO concerns about price and supply uncertainty following the end of the Ohio Companies' transition plan market development period. On February 24, 2004, the Ohio Companies filed a revised Rate Stabilization Plan to address PUCO concerns related to the original Rate Stabilization Plan. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO issued an order approving the revised Rate Stabilization Plan, subject to conducting a competitive bid process. On August 5, 2004, the Ohio Companies accepted the Rate Stabilization Plan as modified and approved by the PUCO on August 4, 2004. In the second quarter of 2004, the Ohio Companies implemented the accounting modifications related to the extended amortization periods and interest costs deferral on the deferred customer shopping incentive balances. On October 1 and October 4, 2004, the OCC and NOAC, respectively, filed appeals with the Supreme Court of Ohio to overturn the June 9, 2004 PUCO order and associated entries on rehearing. The revised Rate Stabilization Plan extends current generation prices through 2008, ensuring adequate generation supply at stabilized prices, and continues the Ohio Companies' support of energy efficiency and economic development efforts. Other key components of the revised Rate Stabilization Plan include the following:\n·\nextension of the transition cost amortization period for OE from 2006 to as late as 2007; for CEI from 2008 to as late as mid-2009 and for TE from mid-2007 to as late as mid-2008;\n·\ndeferral of interest costs on the accumulated customer shopping incentives as new regulatory assets; and\n·\nability to request increases in generation charges during 2006 through 2008, under certain limited conditions, for increases in fuel costs and taxes. On December 9, 2004, the PUCO rejected the auction price results from a required competitive bid process and issued an entry stating that the pricing under the approved revised Rate Stabilization Plan will take effect on January 1, 2006."

Investors in our common stock could lose part or all of their investment in our shares. FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK\nFrom its inception on October 31, 2008, the Company has been funded by its sole officer and director and from proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. We have generated no revenues or profits through December 31, 2010. We also have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. As of December 31, 2010, we had incurred a net loss of approximately $41,596 since inception. From December 2009, until March 23, 2010, we issued an aggregate of 2,932,559 shares to a total of 54 investors at a purchase price of $.01 per share for an aggregate amount of $29,325. We have generated no revenue since inception and our loss from operations was $38,339 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. There was no activity in the Company for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Net cash used by operating activities was $32,489 and net cash provided by financing activities was $32,545 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.",
      "The net cash used in or provided by operating activities for both years is mainly attributable to the net loss or the net income each year. There was no cash provided by or used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities was $51,882 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and was primarily from loan payable proceeds. Net cash used in financing activities was $16,100 for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily from member distributions. CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has financed operations primarily through cash flows from operations, officer advances, and debt and equity financings. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur capital, inventory, administrative and other expenses. The Company's current monthly \"burn rate\" is approximately $13,800, which includes aggregate monthly fees of $10,000 for two consultants that are being accrued until funds are available for payment. We are in the process of forming a funding strategy to raise approximately $500,000 in order to fully implement our business plan, which includes recruiting and hiring additional individuals, expanding our inventory and obtaining additional licenses and certifications, as discussed in the Business Development - Short-Term Growth section of the Description of Business. We have not decided on a funding strategy yet and we have no firm commitments from any investors to date. Our monthly \"burn rate\" will increase to approximately $17,250 per month if we are successful in raising the approximate $500,000 in funding. The Company will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. There are no additional financing requirements required to maintain and continue the Company's operations during the next twelve months."

Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore solely from underground sources in 2012, with mill feed\nNEWMONT MINING CORPORATION\nsupplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 333,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves. Tanami. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. We have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami Shaft Project, as we focus on (i) improving the execution and delivery at the existing operation, and (ii) gaining a better understanding of the impact of the nearer surface underground Auron discovery on the overall life-of-mine plan. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami Shaft Project in 2015. During 2012, the Tanami operations produced 183,000 ounces, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 2.2 million ounces of gold reserves. Waihi, New Zealand. Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 94 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Auckland and currently consists of the Trio underground deposit and the Martha open pit mine. The Waihi operation produced 67,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.\nDuketon. We have a 19.75% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold project, located approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of Kalgoorlie."

      "PF Chang’s is also widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw with typical annual sales volumes of $6.0 million. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. A lease was also executed with Barnes & Noble for a 33,000 square-foot store including an exterior entrance facing Wolf Road, as well as an entrance fronting onto the main mall corridor. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. A lease was also executed with L.L. Bean for an approximately 30,000 square-foot store. This will be L.L. Bean’s first store in the state of New York. We expect the store to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop tenant sales for Colonie Center in 2006 were $302 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. However, the mediocre shop sales are in sharp contrast to the mall’s strong anchor tenant sales. We believe that in 2006, the Colonie Center Macy’s had approximately $61.5 million in sales and Sears had approximately $51 million in sales. We also believe that each will continue to operate as anchor tenant strongholds for Colonie Center. Boscov’s had annual sales of $28 million in 2006. In addition, Christmas Tree Shops reported sales in 2006 of $21 million, which equates to sales of over $379 per square foot. Collectively, the Colonie Center anchor tenants reported approximately $163 million in combined sales in 2006. We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the property’s rental revenue. Financing\nIn June 2005, we completed a $50.8 million first mortgage bridge financing collateralized by the Colonie Center Mall. Subsequently, in September 2006, we refinanced the bridge loan with a new construction loan that currently has a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $116 million. The new construction loan matures in October 2008. A portion of this loan, in the amount of $50.8 million, has a fixed interest rate of 6.84%.",
      "One of these newly signed leases was executed with Regal Cinemas. The new Regal Theater at Colonie will be a 60,000 square foot, luxury and state-of-the-art stadium-seated 14 screen movie theater. The theater will rise nearly 10 stories in height and will be situated over the existing roof of the mall. The height of the theater is expected to create dramatic sight lines to Interstate 87. One of the newly signed leases is the Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake Factory is widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw. The average Cheesecake Factory has sales of over $11.0 million per annum. Typical wait times for a Cheesecake Factory are one to two hours. As a result of this unusually long waiting time, an enormous amount of additional mall traffic is anticipated. In addition, a lease was recently executed with PF Chang’s China Bistro for approximately 7,000 square feet. PF Chang’s is also widely known for its unusually high sales volumes and powerful draw with typical annual sales volumes of $6.0 million. A lease was also executed with Barnes & Noble who will open a 33,000 square foot store including an exterior entrance facing Wolf Road, as well as an entrance fronting onto the main mall corridor. Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop tenant sales for Colonie Center in 2005 were $283 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. However, the mediocre shop sales are in sharp contrast to the mall’s strong anchor tenant sales. We believe that in 2005, the Colonie Center Macy’s had approximately $61.5 million in sales and Sears had approximately $49 million in sales. We also believe that each will continue to operate as anchor tenant strongholds for Colonie Center. Boscov’s at Colonie Center had annual sales of $28 million in 2005. In addition, Christmas Tree Shops (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond), reported sales in 2005 of $23 million, which equates to sales of over $400 per square foot. Collectively, the Colonie Center anchor tenants reported approximately $162 million in combined sales in 2005.",

Anchor Tenant Sales Versus Shop Tenant Sales\nShop tenant sales for Colonie Center in 2004 were $283 per square foot, which categorizes this mall as a Class B mall. However, the mediocre shop sales are in sharp contrast to the mall’s strong anchor tenant sales.

Collectively, the Colonie Center anchor tenants reported approximately $160 million in combined sales in 2003. We believe that there is an opportunity to increase shop tenant sales per square foot and thereby grow the property’s rental revenue. Financing\nWe financed the acquisition of Colonie Center from the net proceeds from our recent initial public offering and proceeds from the Stratford Square Mall mortgage. We may elect to place mortgage financing on the property and use the proceeds from such financing to acquire additional properties. Renovation and Repositioning Plan\nOur opportunity, with respect to Colonie Center, is to take advantage of the mall’s unusually strong anchor tenant sales and leverage such sales into higher shop tenant sales. In addition, with approximately 123,000 square feet of shop space available, there is an opportunity to create value for our stockholders through an ongoing leasing program.",

Colonie Center is a 1.2 million square-foot, super-regional mall serving Albany, New York and its surrounding areas. Colonie Center is anchored by four major department stores: Macy’s, Sears, Boscov’s and Christmas Tree Shops (a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond). In addition, the mall has two important “junior anchors”, which are Steve & Barry’s and an f.y.e. super store. The mall’s anchor tenants are complemented by numerous nationally recognized retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Bath & Body Works, Bombay Company, The Children’s Place, The Gap, Limited Too and Victoria’s Secret.

    "question": "Etec Systems, Inc. has a lease agreement with Registrant for the office and manufacturing facilities in Hayward, California. As part of the lease, Etec Systems, Inc. granted Registrant warrants to purchase 159,314 shares of Etec common stock. In 2002, Registrant exercised these warrants, and as a result, Etec Systems, Inc. received a payment of approximately $6,479,000. However, the lease agreement also included a security deposit equal to three months of the initial annual rent, which was refunded to Etec Systems, Inc. in August 1996. The refund was applied to the mortgage loan, and the lender reamortized the loan. The existing lease was modified to extend the initial term by nineteen months to August 31, 2011, and annual rent was reduced by $347,289 to $1,023,036. Considering the changes to the lease agreement and the exercise of the warrants, what is the current outstanding balance of the mortgage loan on the Etec Systems, Inc. property, taking into account the impact of the construction of a 60,000 square foot addition and the changes in rent and loan terms?",

      "A balloon payment of approximately $6,479,000 will be due in February 2002. In addition, Etec posted a security deposit equal to three months of the initial annual rent, which security deposit will be applied against the last three months rent or, if such rent has been paid, against any other amounts due to Registrant. The security deposit may be commingled with other funds of Registrant. - 8 -\nEtec has also agreed to allow Registrant to exercise its remaining 68,764 warrants by either paying the cash exercise price or by a cashless exercise in which Registrant would receive shares equal to the fair market value less the exercise price of such shares. Etec is a leading producer of electron beam and laser lithography equipment. These systems are used in the manufacturing of masks for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. PROPERTY LEASED TO WAL-MART STORES, INC.\nOn February 10, 1995, Registrant, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased a warehouse/distribution facility in Greenfield, Indiana leased to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Wal-Mart\") for $3,584,905. Concurrently with the acquisition of the property, the lease was assigned to Registrant. Registrant is required to pay the cost of insurance and taxes up to the amount of $41,280 in any lease year. The initial term of the lease ends January 31, 2005. Wal-Mart has the right to extend the lease for three five-year renewal terms. Annual basic rent is $397,235, payable monthly. During each renewal term, the lease provides for rent increases of 12% over the rent payable during the previous term. Registrant received limited recourse mortgage financing of $2,500,000 on the property in September 1995. The loan has a term of ten years, an interest rate of 8.23% per annum and provides for 36 monthly payments of interest and principal of $22,223 based on an 18 year amortization schedule followed by 84 monthly payments of interest and principal in the amount of $21,270 based upon a 20-year amortization schedule, with a balloon payment for the entire outstanding principal balance due at maturity.",
      "The lease had a term of 15 years, with four five-year renewal terms with annual rent of $1,370,325 with such rent adjusted during the first five lease years to reflect any increases or decreases in monthly debt service payments due under the loan. In August 1996, Registrant entered into a modification agreement with Etec. In consideration for the Registrant agreeing to cancel its rights for 90,546 warrants, Etec refunded $2,633,973 of the original purchase price of the property to Registrant. The refund was applied as a prepayment to the mortgage loan, and the lender reamortized the loan. The existing lease was modified to extend the initial term by nineteen months to August 31, 2011 and annual rent was reduced by $347,289 to $1,023,036. Registrant also made a commitment to fund the construction of a 60,000 square foot addition at the Etec property. The funding of the addition will consist of three installments through January 31, 1998 with a first installment of $5,000,000 made in February 1997. The lease terms will be modified upon each installment payment. With the January 1997 installment, annual rent increased by $574,000 to $1,597,036. For the second and third installments, rent will increase by an amount equal to the monthly amortization payment required to repay the installments over the remaining initial term of the lease based on an annual interest rate of 8.28% for contributions of up to $2,500,000 and an annual interest rate of 8.43% for contributions in excess of $2,500,000. The commitment to fund the addition is for a maximum of $9,000,000 including the $5,000,000 of mortgage financing, plus structuring, development and acquisition fees payable to an affiliate. In connection with the August 1996 loan prepayment, the loan was modified from interest at a variable rate to 8.03% per annum. Upon receipt of the $5,000,000 mortgage financing for the first installment of the new construction, the existing loan was increased to a balance of $8,220,000. The terms of the loan were further modified to provide for $6,300,000 of the loan to be at a fixed rate of 8.03% per annum and the remaining amount at a variable rate with monthly principal payments based on a 15-year amortization schedule.",
      "On October 14, 1994, Registrant acquired an additional 49.99% interest in the general partnership in exchange for a payment of approximately $4,840,000.\n- 7 -\nThe cost of acquiring the Gensia property and of completing the facility was $23,200,000. The general partnership financed a portion of the purchase price and the cost of completing the facility with a limited recourse mortgage loan in the amount of $13,000,000, which mortgage loan bears interest at the rate of 8.125% per annum and is fully amortizing over a term of 15 years. The initial term of the lease is 15 years, with four ten-year renewal terms. The lease provides annual rent to $2,618,000, with rent increases every five years based on a formula indexed to increases in the Consumer Price Index (the \"CPI\") with a cap of 4% in any one year. Payment of monthly installments of basic rent during the first five years of any 10-year renewal term will be in an amount equal to 95% of the Fair Market Rent (determined pursuant to the lease) of the property and is subject to adjustment at the end of the fifth year of such renewal term to reflect the percentage increase in the CPI as set forth above. In no event will the basic rent payable during the first five years of any 10-year renewal term increase or decrease by more than 22% from the basic rent in effect at the end of the prior term. Gensia is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products primarily for the treatment and diagnosis of human diseases. PROPERTY LEASED TO ETEC SYSTEMS, INC.\nOn February 9, 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant purchased from Etec Systems, Inc. (\"Etec\") the office/ manufacturing facilities of Etec in Hayward, California and entered into a net lease with Etec. Registrant contributed equity of approximately $5,610,000 to the purchase of the Etec property and obtained $6,250,000 of limited recourse mortgage financing. Registrant also was granted warrants to purchase 159,314 shares of Etec common stock.",
      "In 2002, Registrant leased approximately 2,660 square feet of such retail space (plus 1,000 square feet of storage space) for an approximate annual rent of $298,000. One of the existing retail tenants, leasing approximately 2,950 square feet for an approximate annual rent of $414,000 is delinquent in its rent payments; Registrant may evict this tenant after drawing down the letter of credit held as security for this lease. Registrant has been engaged in discussions to lease its remaining vacant retail space but has yet to enter into any binding lease agreements. During 2001, Registrant experienced vacancies in office space aggregating approximately 29,950 square feet (with aggregate annual rents of approximately $1,200,000) at 475 Fifth Avenue. One of such leases (for 14,470 square feet and annual rents of approximately $607,000) was terminated early in exchange for a fee in the approximate amount of $720,000. In late 2002 and early 2003, Registrant has experienced additional office vacancies and relocations of tenants to smaller spaces aggregating approximately 14,770 square feet, with approximate annual aggregate rent of $525,000. Registrant is currently negotiating a lease buy-out on approximately 14,860 square feet of office space (annual rent of approximately $452,000) and, as described above, has been receiving only a portion of the rent due from another office tenant (approximately 13,825 square feet at an approximate annual rent of $553,000) that will vacate the space when Registrant obtains a replacement tenant. Registrant did not enter into any new leases for office space in 2002, but in the first quarter of 2003 it has entered into leases for an aggregate of approximately 19,940 square feet at an approximate annual aggregate rent of $711,000 (after free rent periods). Registrant's leases generally provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of a porter's wage and real estate tax escalation factors; Registrant may\nincrease the electricity charge if a review demonstrates that Registrant's cost of obtaining such electricity exceeds the charge imposed on tenants. Certain tenants (leasing approximately 20% to 25% of the space in the building) have leases that provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of operating expense and real estate tax escalation factors."

      "SFAS 109 also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Hedging Activities -- The Company periodically enters into ------------------ agreements with third parties to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in future oil and gas prices. Gains or losses on such agreements are deferred and recognized as oil and gas revenue when the hedged production occurs. At December 31, 1996, the Company was a party to a crude oil swap agreement and a crude oil collar arrangement, each with a contract volume of 10,000 barrels per month through December 31, 1997. The swap agreement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the $18.32 per barrel contract price and the average closing NYMEX crude oil price during each month. The collar arrangement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the monthly average closing NYMEX price and the contract floor of $19.50 per barrel or the contract ceiling of $24.35 per barrel, if the monthly average closing NYMEX price falls outside of the range defined by such contract floor and contract ceiling. In accordance with SFAS 107, \"Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" the Company has estimated the fair value of its hedging arrangements utilizing the NYMEX crude oil strip at December 31, 1996. While it is not the Company's intention to terminate either of the arrangements, it is estimated that the Company would have been required to pay approximately $525,000 to terminate the arrangements on December 31, 1996. As of February 12, 1997, the estimated cost to terminate such arrangements was approximately $325,000, inclusive of the actual cost of contract settlements through that date. Due to the volatility of crude oil prices, the fair market value may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that will be realized by the Company in 1997. The Company recognized a reduction in oil revenue of $480,000, $115,000 and $95,000 under hedging agreements in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

    "question": "Nextel International's investment in Shanghai CCT McCaw is subject to a 10% withholding tax on interest payments. However, dividends paid to foreign investors are exempt from withholding tax. If Nextel International's Shanghai CCT McCaw subsidiary experiences a significant increase in its Renminbi earnings, which would allow for the conversion of Renminbi to foreign currencies for dividend payments, and considering the Company's 81% equity interest in Nextel Brazil and the Brazilian government's potential restrictions on the remittance of dividends to foreign investors, what is the potential impact on Nextel International's financial results, particularly in light of the Brazilian government's historical practice of granting SMR licenses for a 15-year period and the possibility of automatic license renewal upon submission of an application?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The Company's financial results would be positively affected, as the increased Renminbi earnings would allow for more dividend payments to be made to foreign investors, potentially leading to increased revenue and profitability.",
      "B) The Company's financial results would be negatively affected, as the increased Renminbi earnings would lead to a higher withholding tax on interest payments, offsetting any potential benefits from increased dividend payments.",
      "C) The Company's financial results would be unaffected, as the increased Renminbi earnings would not impact the Company's ability to remit dividends to foreign investors due to the exemption from withholding tax, and the Brazilian government's restrictions on dividend remittance would not significantly affect the Company's financial performance.",
      "D) Correct Answer: The Company's financial results would be negatively affected, as the increased Renminbi earnings would lead to a higher risk of the Brazilian government imposing restrictions on the remittance of dividends to foreign investors, potentially limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid, and the automatic license renewal policy could lead to increased costs and complexity in managing the Company's operations in Brazil."

      "Both markets operate at floating rates freely negotiated between the parties. The purchase of currency for repatriation of capital invested in the country and for payment of dividends to foreign shareholders of Brazilian companies is made in the commercial/financial floating market, provided that the original investment of foreign capital and capital increases were registered with the Central Bank of Brazil. In this case, there are no significant restrictions on the repatriation of share capital and remittance of dividends. The majority of the capital of Nextel S.A., the Brazilian subsidiary through which any dividends are expected to flow, has been registered with the Brazilian monetary authorities, and Nextel S.A. intends to structure future capital contributions to Brazilian subsidiaries to maximize the amount of share capital and dividends that can be repatriated through the commercial financial exchange market. There can be no assurance that Nextel S.A. can repatriate through the commercial financial exchange market share capital and dividends on foreign investments that have not been registered. Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments, the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil. The Brazilian government may also impose restrictions on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. Any such restrictions may hinder or prevent the Company from purchasing equipment required to be paid for in any currency other than Brazilian reais. Under current law, there is a 15% withholding tax on interest payments. Dividends paid out of profits generated after December 31, 1996 are currently not subject to withholding tax.

Nextel Mexico began offering commercial analog SMR operations in September 1993 and launched commercial ESMR service in Mexico City under the tradename \"Nextel(TM)\" during the third quarter of 1998.",
      "As a result of such devaluation, the Company will record a pre-tax charge (net of minority interests) of approximately $45.1 million on its consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 1999 related to foreign currency transaction losses. This amount has been calculated based on the outstanding amount of U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries, the average exchange rate of the Brazilian real during the first quarter of 1999 and the Company's percentage ownership interest in its Brazilian subsidiaries at the end of such period. Additionally, the Company will record a negative cumulative translation adjustment on its balance sheet (determined in a manner consistent with prior periods) of approximately $136.1 million based on the exchange rate as of the end of the first quarter of 1999, which will be reflected as an adjustment to the cumulative translation adjustment account within stockholders' equity. Although the Company cannot predict what other effects the devaluation of the Brazilian real will have on its results of operation and the value of its investments in Brazil, the devaluation could have significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations due to, among other things, (i) the additional amount in Brazilian reais that the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries will have to pay for U.S. dollar-denominated purchases of certain equipment and services; (ii) the Company's reduced U.S. dollar-converted revenue stream from its Brazilian subsidiaries; and (iii) the impact of the devaluation on the Brazilian economy, and on the economies of the other Latin American countries in which the Operating Companies conduct business.

      "The Company's investment in Shanghai CCT McCaw is carried on the Company's book at cost, which was approximately $15.7 million as of December 31, 1998. Pursuant to the current PRC Regulation on Foreign Exchange Control, Renminbi, the currency of China, is freely convertible under current account, however, it is not freely convertible under capital account. A foreign invested enterprise is permitted to convert its Renminbi earnings to foreign currencies for the purpose of enabling the foreign investors to receive dividends and interest payments. Conversion of Renminbi to foreign currencies for the purpose of repatriating foreign investors' capital contributions to, and principal payments from, a foreign invested enterprise is subject to approval by relevant government authorities, which approval will be granted upon showing that the foreign invested enterprise has been lawfully terminated and dissolved or the loan has been properly registered, as the case may be. The company's loan to Shanghai CCT McCaw has been registered with the relevant governmental authority. Under current law there is a 10% withholding tax on interest payments and no withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign investors out of the foreign invested enterprise. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs of December 31, 1998 , Nextel International owned 100% of its Operating Companies in Mexico and Argentina. The following is a description of the Company's contractual relationships with its partners in the other Operating Companies.\nBRAZIL. The Company owns 81% of the capital stock of Nextel Brazil, which entitles it to 90% of the voting rights. The Company, therefore, has the right to make management and operating decisions of Nextel Brazil. The Telcom Group owns 19% of the capital stock, which entitles it to 10% of the voting rights.

Nextel Brazil's subsidiaries are currently conducting analog SMR system installation with regard to a significant portion of such channels and are in discussions with Anatel regarding their proposed installation and loading plan. To the extent the Company is not able to acquire the balance of the ownership interest in a particular licensee, the Company believes that Nextel S.A., a subsidiary of Nextel Brazil and the holding company for Nextel Brazil's SMR licensee companies, would be able to continue to maintain its contractual right to render management services for the operations subject to the license held by such licensee pursuant to a service agreement and receive fees under such service agreement. Nextel Brazil, however, would not own such license and the its rights with respect to such license could be limited. There can be no assurance that Anatel would not challenge the validity of such service agreements. All of Nextel Brazil's channels in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are indirectly and entirely owned by Nextel S.A. and are not held pursuant to Option Agreements nor covered by the proposed installation and loading plan referred to above. While the Company believes it will receive Anatel approval for its installation and loading plan and Anatel approval for transfer of control when it has met the installation requirements under such plan and commenced commercial operations, no assurance can be given that such approval will be obtained. Since July 13, 1994, it had been the Brazil Ministry of Communication's practice to grant SMR licenses for a 15-year period and to renew such licenses for an equal period upon submission of an application to the Brazil Ministry of Communications. Certain of the Company's licenses granted prior to July 13, 1994 were granted for a term of five years and the Company has been informed by the Brazil Ministry of Communications that such licenses have been automatically extended for a term of 15 years from their original issuance date."

      "Assuming all renewal or extension options are exercised, the average remaining term is approximately seven years. Fees\nGenerally, the management agreements for franchised hotels contain a two-tiered fee structure in which the management company receives a base management fee and, if certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management\nfee, each calculated on a per hotel basis. The base management fees range from 2% to 3% of gross hotel revenue, with some base fees increasing over time. Almost all of the incentive management fees range from 15% to 30% of net operating income (or other similar metric, as defined in the management agreement) remaining after deducting a priority return typically equal to 9% to 11% of our total capital investment in the hotel. We also pay certain accounting services fees to the management companies under a majority of the agreements. Termination Events\nPerformance Termination\nAs with our management agreements for brand-managed hotels, most of the management agreements for franchised hotels provide us with a right to terminate the agreement if the management company fails to achieve certain criteria relating to the performance of the hotel. Generally, we may initiate a performance termination if, during any two consecutive year period, (i) the hotel fails to achieve a specified amount of operating profit, and (ii) certain operating metrics of the hotel, as compared to a competitive set of hotels in the relevant local market as agreed between the parties, fail to exceed a specified threshold as set forth in the applicable management agreement. In some of the management agreements for franchised hotels, the management company has a right, which can usually be exercised no more than once per hotel, to avoid a performance termination by paying an amount specified in the applicable management agreement. Early Termination and Liquidated Damages\nSubject to certain qualifications, notice requirements and applicable cure periods, the management agreements for franchised hotels are generally terminable by either party upon a material casualty or condemnation of the hotel or the occurrence of certain customary events of default, including, among others: the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party; a breach by either party of covenants or obligations under the management agreement, including a failure by us to provide required operating funds or our failure to make a payment when due and failure to cure such non-payment after due notice; a default by either party under the corresponding franchise agreement; a failure of either party to maintain a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages; and a failure by either party to maintain insurance policies required under the management agreement.",

BMCLP must assure that there is sufficient working capital on hand to make timely payment of all current obligations of the Hotel (including the annual management fee) and to assure the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the Hotel as a first class hotel development.

As of December 31, 1996 these financial obligations were met by BMCLP. Pursuant to an amendment to its management agreement in connection with the 1992 loan modification with BMCLP's prior lender, which remains in effect as to Hyatt under the newly amended and restated first and second mortgage loans, Hyatt agreed to reduce its basic management fee from 4% to 3% from December 31, 1991 to December 31, 1995. In return for this reduction, BMCLP agreed to modify the Owner's Remittance of the Hotel Management Agreement, by extending the Sixth Full Year by one additional year for each year that Hyatt reduced its basic fee. In addition, the calculation of the contingent incentive fee includes the basic fee at the original 4%. As of January 1, 1996, the basic management fee has returned to 4%.

      "By the end of the year, 4 holes, totaling 607 m, were completed. A bulldozer was also shipped in parts up the Inini River and reassembled on the project. Trenching was initiated and 199 m of trenches were opened. Guyanor incurred exploration expenditures for the Dorlin project of $1.0 million for 1996, all of which were reimbursed by Cambior under the above-mentioned agreement. The work program for 1997 calls for continued soil and auger sampling, trenching and 8,000 m of core drilling. The objectives for the program are to develop minable resources on the South-Inini area and carry out the investigation in the North-Inini area, which host three intrusive related targets known as Jadfar, Sept Kilo and Dartagnan. PAUL-ISNARD AND EAU-BLANCHE\nOn October 29, 1994, Guyanor acquired its interest in the Paul-Isnard and Eau-Blanche properties by way of its acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of SOTRAPMAG, a company incorporated under the laws of France and based in French Guiana. SOTRAPMAG holds a 99.7% interest in SGM, a societe en nom collectif incorporated under the laws of France, also based in French Guiana. Guyanor also directly acquired the 0.3% interest in SGM not owned by SOTRAPMAG. SOTRAPMAG holds, directly or indirectly, eight mineral concessions (the \"Paul-Isnard Concessions\") and four type \"B\" exploration permits (the \"Eau-Blanche Permits\"). Pursuant to an agreement (the \"Cermi Agreement\") dated October 29, 1994, between SOTRAPMAG and Cermi S.A.R.L. (\"Cermi\"), a corporation owned by the previous owners of SOTRAPMAG, SOTRAPMAG granted Cermi the exclusive right to exploit alluvial minerals on a portion (the \"Elysee Creek area\") of two of the Paul-Isnard Concessions for a period of three years, renewable for an additional seven years. During the renewal period, SOTRAPMAG may, at its discretion, terminate the Cermi Agreement upon 90 days' notice. In consideration for this grant, Cermi agreed to pay SOTRAPMAG a royalty of 2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of gold produced from Cermi's alluvial operations in the Elysee Creek area.",
      "Mineralization is associated with quartz veining. At Elysee, channel sampling inside old adits from the Bureau Minier Guyanais indicated anomalous grades of gold. A detailed geological survey was\ninitiated. Total expenditures by all parties for 1996 were $1.4 million for Paul-Isnard and $0.1 million for Eau-Blanche, with joint venture recoveries totaling $1.5 million for the two projects in 1996. Guyanor's share of these expenditures were funded by ASARCO. The work program planned for 1997 includes ground geophysical surveys on Montagne d'Or, including induced polarization (\"IP\"), magnetics and downhole electro magnetics (\"EM\"). This work is intended to assist in preparing a core drilling program at Montagne d'Or. Additional geochemistry, ground magnetic surveys and trenching are planned for Emmanuel and Elysee in order to prepare core drilling program for the targets. A core drilling budget of 4,500 m has been budgeted to test the Paul-Isnard targets during 1997. Mining Operations\nSOTRAPMAG commenced alluvial gold production at the Paul-Isnard property in 1987. SOTRAPMAG has experienced continuing operating losses since its acquisition by Guyanor in 1994 with operating losses of $1.8 million in 1995 and $2.4 million in 1996. Outside consultants engaged in 1996 to review the operations and make recommendations on how to make the operations profitable concluded that without a significant capital investment to increase production, changes in certain work practices and a reduction in fuel taxes, the operation could not achieve profitability. As a result of these conclusions, Guyanor began implementation of a program to discontinue alluvial operations conducted by SOTRAPMAG and lay off all of SOTRAPMAG's employees. This procedure is subject to negotiations with the representatives of the workers and French authorities. The French government was formally notified of the closure plans in January 1997. In March 1997, the deadline for French government opposition to the closure plan expired, with no such opposition expressed by the government.",
      "Dorlin - Work Program\nExploration work on the Dorlin permits has focused on two zones, the South-Inini and North-Inini zones, situated on two different permits and covering a large area. During 1995, a total of 55 km of lines were cut on these two sectors and a total of 838 soil samples by manual augering and 242 samples by deep augering were taken. Extensive channel sampling of outcrop on the southern end of Montagne Nivre began. In 1996, outcrop sampling continued and 57 deep auger holes for a total of 565 m were drilled. In the second half of the year, Guyanor drilled 31 core holes, totaling approximately 2,000 m, and recompiled results from the 1986 BRGM-BHP drilling program, 19 holes, totaling approximately 4,323 m. Guyanor's drilling focused on the Sud Nivre zone on a prominent ridge known as Montagne Nivre while the BRGM-BHP drilling focused on the West Nivre zone to the north of Sud Nivre and on the west flank of Montagne Nivre. Guyanor established the presence of two zones of mineralization approximately 40 to 50 m wide over a strike length of approximately 750 m. Mineralization was encountered in approximately 74% of the core holes drilled by Guyanor, exhibiting average widths of 9.8 m at a weighted average grade of 1.9 g Au/t. Drilling conducted by the BRGM and BHP on the West Nivre zone and across the northern extension of the zones drilled by Guyanor encountered mineralization in approximately 79% of the core holes drilled, exhibiting average widths of 9.9 m at a weighted average grade of 1.9 g Au/t. Drilling to date has indicated the presence of mineralization over a strike length of approximately 1.5 km on the far southern end of a major hydrothermal breccia system which has been identified continuously over 5 km and discontinuously over an additional 4 km. Late in 1996, a second, 2,400 m drilling campaign was initiated to test gold mineralization discovered by Guyanor at greater depths and to infill drill on the zones of mineralization discovered by BRGM-BHP.",
      "Management currently anticipates to substantially complete the closure of the plan and local rehabilitation in the second quarter of 1997. Guyanor and the Company, through its ownership interest in Guyanor, incurred a fourth quarter charge to 1996 earnings of $3.2 million resulting from the write-down of certain fixed assets, inventories, capitalized exploration costs related to the alluvial mining operations, accrual of land rehabilitation and mine closure costs, and accrual of the severance and other costs associated with the discontinuation of alluvial production. The Company's share of these losses at December 31, 1996, was $2.2 million, after minority interest. Certain fixed assets, equipment and inventories owned by SOTRAPMAG will be utilized in the ongoing exploration at the Paul-Isnard project area and were not subject to the write-down. The final amount of severance and other costs associated with the discontinuation of alluvial production are contingent upon negotiations with the representatives of the workers and the French government. Guyanor also expects to incur operating losses of approximately $0.5 million during the first quarter of 1997. Exploration efforts conducted in 1996 have identified several target areas which hold potential to establish near surface mining reserves. Guyanor has budgeted approximately $1.0 million in 1997 for prospecting activities aimed at quantifying a near-surface mineralized inventory at the Paul-Isnard project area. This program is in addition to the hard rock exploration planned for 1997 which will be funded by ASARCO and LaSource, the Company's joint venture partners at the Paul-Isnard project area. REGINA EST\nOn April 26, 1994, Guyanor was granted a type \"B\" exploration permit covering a property known as Regina Est, located in northeastern French Guiana, 15 km southeast of the town of Regina and 80 km southeast of Cayenne. No significant work was conducted on the property in 1996. The permit, unless renewed, will expire on May 1, 1998.",
      "The results from the recent 9,200 metres of drilling at Dorlin are not reflected in the current estimate of mineralized inventories for Yaou and Dorlin, but are being incorporated into a new geologic model. Yaou was put on care and maintenance early in the third quarter of 1997 in order to direct the exploration budget defining further resources at Dorlin. Cambior and Guyanor are currently preparing a geologic model and conducting metallurgical test work and preliminary engineering and costing for the prefeasibility studies which are scheduled to be completed during the second half of 1998. Limited field work will be conducted at Yaou and Dorlin during the first six months of 1998 while the prefeasibility studies are being completed. The results of the prefeasibility studies will help determine the need for additional exploration activity at Yaou and Dorlin during the second half of 1998. During 1997, Guyanor's exploration expenditures on Yaou and Dorlin totaled $5.5 million, $4.7 of which was reimbursed by Cambior under the above-mentioned agreement. During 1996, Guyanor spent a total of $1.1 million on the Yaou project, of which $1.0 million was reimbursed by Cambior. Guyanor has budgeted $1.3 million in the first half of 1998, primarily for on-going geologic evaluation and reserve estimation and preparation of pre-feasibility studies. PAUL-ISNARD AND EAU-BLANCHE\nOn October 29, 1994, Guyanor acquired an interest in the Paul-Isnard and Eau- Blanche properties by way of the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of SOTRAPMAG.

In its 1992 patent application to the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior (“BLM”), Amax stated that the size and grade of the Mount Emmons deposit was determined to approximate 220 million tons grading 0.366% molybdenite. In a letter dated April 2, 2004, BLM estimated that there were about 23 million tons of mineable reserves containing 0.689% molybdenite, and that about 267 million pounds of molybdenum trioxide was recoverable.

In December 2008, an additional 160 acres of fee land in the vicinity of the claims was purchased for $4 million ($2 million in January 2009, $400,000 annually for five years).",
      "In the late 1970s, Amax delineated a large deposit of molybdenum on the properties, reportedly containing approximately 155 million tons of mineralized material averaging 0.44% molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). In 1981, Amax constructed a water treatment plant at the Mount Emmons molybdenum property to treat water flowing from the old Keystone mine workings and for potential use in milling operations. By 1983, Amax had reportedly spent an estimated $150 million in the acquisition of the property, securing water rights, extensive exploration, ore body delineation, mine planning, metallurgical testing and other activities involving the mineral deposit. Amax was merged into Cyprus Minerals in 1992 to form Cyprus Amax. PD then acquired Mount Emmons in 1999 through its acquisition of Cyprus Amax. Thereafter, PD acquired additional conditional water rights and patents to certain mineral claims. The exploration work conducted in the late 1970’s by Amax, Inc. as discussed in Cyprus Amax’s Patent Claim Application to the Bureau of Land Management dated December 23, 1992, defined the initial mineralized material at the Mount Emmons Project as follows: “Molybdenite is present in randomly distributed veinlets (i.e. stockwork veining) and in some larger veins that are up to two feet wide. This mineralized zone is found in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and in Tertiary igneous complex which acted as the source of the mineralization.” There also are a number of existing mine adits located on the property. Historic work completed by Amax, Inc. in the 1970s and early 1980s included: 2,400 feet of new drift with 18 underground diamond drill stations to facilitate underground drilling (consisting of 168 diamond drill holes for a total of 157,037 feet of core drilling). The majority of the drilling was concentrated within 3,000 feet north and south; 3,000 feet east and west and 2,000 vertical feet defining the area of mineralized material. A bulk sample\nwas collected from this area and sent off site for metallurgical testing.",

The Amax, Inc. EIS is now outdated. In its 1992 patent application, Cyprus Amax stated that the size and grade of the Mount Emmons deposit was determined to approximate 220 million tons of mineralized material grading 0.366% molybdenite.

      "The following table provides information relating to our mineral rights located in Colorado:\nNew Mexico\nIn December 2014, we staked 51 claims over the historic Dalton Pass project in the Crownpoint uranium district. Historic drilling at Dalton Pass by Pathfinder Mines indicates that the uranium mineralization occurs as both primary tabular and roll front deposits. Mineralization is hosted by the upper Westwater Canyon Member of the Morrison Formation, a sequence of stacked sands separated by discontinuous shale breaks, at depths ranging from 1,900 feet to 2,100 feet. The following table provides information relating to our mineral rights located in New Mexico:\nTexas\nAt July 31, 2018, we currently own various exploration projects located in the South Texas Uranium Belt. The location and acquisition of these leases are based on historical information contained within our extensive database, as well as current, ongoing geologic analyses by our exploration staff. Texas: Salvo Project\nThe Salvo Project is a 1,514-acre property located in Bee County, Texas. A Phase I exploration drill program was completed in April 2011 with a total of 105 holes drilled. Phase II drilling began at the Salvo Project in October 2011 with two drilling rigs targeting Lower Goliad P and Q sand objectives. A total of 122 exploration and delineation holes for a total of 70,760 feet were drilled during Phase II which was concluded in May 2012. 29 holes (23%) met or exceeded a grade-thickness (“GT”) cutoff of 0.3 GT. Interpretation of our exploration and delineation drilling, along with historic data from 1982 to 1984 exploration drilling by Mobil and URI, revealed the existence of two ore-bearing redox boundaries within the area, which has the potential to become PAA-1. A significant under-explored extension to this area which exhibits strong mineralization remains open-ended. Future plans would include further exploration/delineation drilling in this area in order to fully identify the extent of the mineralized zones in proposed PAA-1. Historic and recent Company drilling results are being reviewed for future exploration/delineation activities in the Salvo Project in order to fully identify the extent of the mineralized zones."

      "BACKGROUND\nThe Kemess South mine is located 182 miles northwest of Mackenzie, British Columbia, and to the east of Thutade Lake. Access to the area is by air from Smithers or Prince George to the 5,225-foot long gravel airstrip on site, and from the south by an all-weather private road from Fort St. James or Mackenzie. In May 1993, Royal Oak acquired a 39.3% controlling interest in Geddes Resources Limited whose only significant asset was a 100%-interest in a block of mineral claims located in the vicinity of Windy Craggy mountain in northwestern British Columbia. In June 1993, the British Columbia provincial government announced that it would permanently protect, as a provincial park, the region that included Windy Craggy, and would provide compensation for holders of mineral claims in the area. Subsequently, in December 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, which includes Windy Craggy, a World Heritage Site. In May 1995, the British Columbia provincial government commenced active negotiations with Geddes pertaining to compensation respecting Windy Craggy. In order to facilitate such negotiations, Royal Oak indicated to the British Columbia provincial government a willingness to purchase and develop the Kemess and Red Mountain properties, on condition the British Columbia provincial government provided appropriate project support and investment arrangements. In January 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of Geddes, El Condor Resources Ltd. and St. Philips Resources Inc. at a total cost of approximately $202 million. The remaining outstanding shares of Geddes were acquired for shares of Royal Oak and cash with a total acquisition cost of $40.9 million. The outstanding shares of El Condor were acquired for shares of Royal Oak and cash valued at $110.6 million, and the outstanding shares of St. Philips were acquired for $38.6 million in cash. El Condor and St. Philips owned the Kemess South property and El Condor owned the Kemess North property.",

      "A total of 24 rock samples were submitted for analysis with the best results reporting 294 ppb gold. Most samples over 50 ppb gold were from boulder float. Elevated arsenic amounts up to 5194 ppm were returned. As with the high gold results, the majority of the elevated arsenic results are from boulder float samples. Although a large gold bearing epithermal system had been outlined in the central claim area covering approximately 20 square kilometers, gold tenors are generally very low, rarely exceeding 500 ppb. Goodall (Global Geological): 1996 - 2003\nThe Bako 1 to 16 claims were subsequently staked by Geoff Goodall, P. Geo. In 1996 to cover previously identified zones of alteration and mineralization. A prospecting program was conducted on the Bako 1 to 5 mineral claims in the spring of 2002. These claims cover eight zones of hydrothermal alteration typified by pronounced bleaching of the host felsic volcanics and are characterized by intense argillic alteration accompanied by multi-stage intense quartz veining, weak to strong silicification, and/or hydrothermal brecciation. The work program consisted of prospecting traverses and rock geochemical sampling of areas adjacent to and within previously discovered zones of alteration. A total of fifty-two rock samples were collected. A strong correlation was shown to exist between anomalous gold values and anomalous silver\nvalues. Samples with anomalous concentrations of antimony also had anomalous levels of arsenic, and mercury was weakly anomalous. Bard Ventures: 2003 - 2004 The property was optioned to Bard Ventures in late 2003 and Global Geological Services established two geophysical grids over the Discovery and Brooks Zones totaling 24.5 line kilometers. Previous mapping and sampling programs within these areas uncovered concentrations of quartz rich boulder float with grab samples indicated anomalous gold values. Regional Geology\nThe Clisbako property is located in the northern part of the Chilcotin Plateau. Specifically, it is situated in the south central part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt along an east-west trend defined by three peralkaline shield volcano complexes (Rainbow Range, Ilgachuz Range, Itcha Range) that comprise the western part of the belt.",
      "The bulk of the work has been concentrated within a 2 kilometer by 4 kilometer north trending corridor in the centre of the project area. Prior to 1989, there is no recorded work on the Clisbako Property. Eighty Eight Resources Ltd.: 1989 - 1991 In 1989, a regional reconnaissance exploration program was conducted within the Nechako Basin by Eighty Eight Resources Ltd. Epithermal quartz float collected on the property returned weakly to moderately anomalous gold, silver and arsenic values. Subsequent work traced these samples to their source and led to the discovery of several extensive areas of epithermal silicification and argillic alteration in 1990. A property consisting of 15 contiguous claims (Clisbako 1-15) covering 7,500 hectares was staked by Eighty-Eight Resources Ltd. to cover these areas. Dawson Geological Consultants Ltd. were contracted to complete a compass and flag grid covering the 4 main mineralized zones (North, Boulder, Central and South Zones). Crews collected 1,320 soil samples from grids covering the mineralized areas, and a total of 253 rock samples were collected from areas of epithermal silicification as well as from mineralized float believed to be locally derived. Geological mapping was also completed.\nMinnova Inc.: 1991- 1992 The property was subsequently optioned to Minnova Inc., and five more claims (Clisbako 16-20) were added to the property in April, 1991, following a compilation of data and re-interpretation of the 1990 field work. Minnova then proceeded to fly an airborne magnetic and electro-magnetic survey over the entire property. Grid line spacing over the pre-existing grid was tightened to 100 meters line spacing and grid lines were extended 1 kilometer to the west. The entire gridded area was geologically mapped and sampled, the results of which delineated the Gore and Pond epithermal alteration zones. A total of 18 trenches were excavated covering 5 mineralized zones (North, South, Central, Discovery and Trail Zones), all of which were mapped in detail and sampled."

The Company anticipates constructing its own milling facility near the mouth of the Kellogg Tunnel. Initially the mill capacity will be 1500 tons per day, and the mill will be designed for ready expansion when needed. The Company has identified multiple tailings disposal sites to the west-northwest of where the mill will be located. As noted above, the E.P.A. for several decades has provided mine water treatment services for the Bunker Hill Mine.

      "Historically the Kellogg Tunnel (or “KT” for short) was used in this manner when the mine was producing upwards of 3000 tons per day of mined material. The Company has inspected the KT for its entire length and has determined that significant timbered sections of the tunnel will need extensive repairs. These are areas that intersect various faults passing through the KT at normal to oblique angles and create unstable ground. The Company has also determined that all of the track, as well as spikes, plates and ties holding the track will need to be replaced.

It is anticipated that earliest production will come from the upper levels of the mine where company personnel have observed mining faces of mineralized material that are readily mineable, as they were left behind by past operators in a more or less fully developed state. These upper mineralized material zones could achieve limited mining at perhaps a rate of 500 tons per day by haulage out through the Russell Tunnel and then trucked from the Milo Gulch landing to one or more potential nearby custom milling facilities. Although the Company believes that the potential does exist for early production by shipping mineralized material to a custom mill, the Company has not yet undertaken discussions with mill owners, but anticipates such discussions could occur within the next one to three months. Longer term, the Company anticipates constructing its own milling facility near the mouth of the Kellogg Tunnel. Initially the mill capacity will be 1500 tons per day, and the mill will be designed for ready expansion when needed.",
      "Upon initiating mine production from the UTZ, Newgard, and Quill zones at rates of approximately 1500 tons per day, the Company would anticipate mining approximately 540,000 tons per year of material. The three aforementioned zones are believed to have sufficient mineral to supply the Company mining needs for approximately 8 years. Once the repairs are completed to the Kellogg Tunnel, mineralized material haulage will be able to immediately occur out of this tunnel, which will enhance the production capabilities of the mine by several magnitudes. Some mineralized material will continue to be transported by rubber-tired equipment directly out the Russel Tunnel, but the majority of mineralized material will be dropped down existing internal passes and be hauled out of the KT on rail. By this time in the restart program the Company would expect to be in production at around 1500 tons per day, which is approximately the planned mill capacity. If all items proceed as planned, the Company believes a steady state production of 1500 tons per day is achievable in approximately 36 months from the time of takeover of operations. Additionally, once the KT repairs are completed, work on the repairs of the shafts and hoists can proceed with greater speed and the lower levels of the mine can be dewatered. The shaft work and pumping should commence at about year two of mine operations. Numerous other past-producing mineral bodies will begin to be revealed as the water levels are lowered and the mine is drained to the fullest. Some of these mineral bodies are lead-silver rich zones such as the Emery, Shea, Veral and the “J”, while others will add more material containing zinc such as the Tallon, Rosco, or Tony, while still others are best described as polymetallic such as the New Landers or the Francis. The Company geologists and engineering personnel have studied the past records thoroughly and conclude that very good exploration and discovery potential exists at depth on downward rakes of known structures."

      "Such channel deposits are characteristically 1.5 to 3 kilometers wide, trending in a north-south direction. CEC Deadwood 8-12-91-22W5\nThis Bluesky test was drilled in March 2013 based on a positive seismic signature that suggested a deep valley fill cut and therefore a thick sandstone deposit. Forty-two meters of core were recovered over the Wilrich shales (caprock) and the Bluesky and underlying Shunda zone (bottom seal). The core was sent to AGAT Laboratories for porosity, permeability, oil saturation, and oil viscosity and oil API gravity analysis. The main goal of the drilled well was to determine the presence of oil, oil quality and where to subsequently shoot a 3-D seismic program should the well be considered successful. Well Logging\nThe well was logged by Baker Hughes after the well was drilled and cored. Resistivity (induction), SP (spontaneous potential), sonic, neutron-density, Pe, gamma ray and caliper logs were run from surface casing to depth. Identified were the glauconitic sandstone between 424 to 427.5 m, the shaley, bioturbated sandstone and sandy shale zone between 427.5 to 443.5 m and the thick sandstone (may be Gething) between 443.5 to approximately 470 m.\nAn oil-water contact is indicated at approximately at 449.5 m (or 451.50 m in core). A sample for oil analysis was taken at approximately 445 m (447.44-447.68 m in core). Core Description and Core Analysis\nCore descriptions by AGAT Laboratories show that the overlying Wilrich shales are grey to earthy grey with fine, disseminated pyrite and traces of carbonaceous material and glauconite. The upper Bluesky interval consists of medium to dark brown oil-stained sandstone with excellent intergranular porosity, even to spotty brown oil staining and dull yellow to orange fluorescence. The middle Bluesky interval consists of both sandstone and shale with banded to spotty oil staining throughout, variably laminated and bioturbated with pyrite, carbonaceous material and occasional glauconite. The lower zone consists of dark brown oil-stained sandstone with excellent intergranular porosity, grading to spotty oil stain with depth.",
      "Cores were obtained from the prospective zones of interest and submitted to AGAT Laboratories for porosity, permeability, oil saturation, and oil viscosity and API oil gravity analyses. Based on the existing data from the public domain, three heavy oil play types have been identified on North Star lands in the Manning area:\n1) Mississippian Elkton Member (Elkton) erosional edge carbonates,\n2) Mississippian Debolt Formation (Debolt) erosional edge carbonates, and\n3) Cretaceous Bluesky Formation (Bluesky) estuarine valley fill sandstones\nDuring fiscal 2014 North Star completed two production test wells - one horizontal in the Elkton Member (9-4-92-23 W5) - currently suspended and one vertical in the Bluesky/Gething Formation (7-10-91-22 W5M) - subsequently abandoned/reclaimed, as well as a 4 mi sq 3D seismic program. In July 2014 North Star drilled a horizontal production well which has been put on production. Bluesky Channel (Estuarine Valley Fill) Prospect\nThe Bluesky Formation is the major producing zone in the Peace River area of northern Alberta. It is a sandstone that was deposited in the Lower Cretaceous within a marginal marine environment. Major operators south of Manning include Shell, Baytex, PennWest, Koch and Murphy. The heavy oil and bitumen-filled sandstones are exploited by primary recovery multi leg horizontal wells and secondary steam methods such as CSS. In the Manning area, a Bluesky deposit was identified by a combination of geological and seismic evaluation. Comparison of selected well logs from the south to the north Peace River Bluesky suggests petrophysical similarities, indicating potential for good porosity and heavy oil presence. Oil Trapping and Seismic Evaluation\nHeavy oil trapping in the Bluesky Formation is different than in the Elkton and Debolt. Oil is trapped statigraphically in porous sandstones with lateral and vertical seals (i.e., Wilrich shales) created by variations in lithology such as sandstones grading into sandy shales. Seismic evaluation is particularly instrumental in determining thick channel deposits such as those discovered south of Manning."

      "In addition to Base Rent, beginning in 1997 Participating Rent may be payable by the Initial Lessees. Participating Rent is calculated based on increases in the Gross Golf revenue from a base year of 1996 as adjusted. Consequently, no calculation of Participating Rent is included above. (2) The Heathland, Moorland and Parkland courses are subject to a single Participating Lease providing for gross Base Rent of $4,669,905, and the Base Rent is allocated equally among these three courses. The Participating Leases provide for the Company to receive, with respect to each Initial Lessee, the greater of Base Rent or an amount equal to Participating Rent plus the Initial Base Rent payable under each Participating Lease. Participating Rent is equal to 33 1/3% of any increase in Gross Golf Revenue over Gross Golf Revenue for the 1996 base year, as adjusted in determining the initial Base Rent, which base year will be reset to the year immediately preceding the date on which the Prior Owner exercises the Lessee performance Option, if applicable. Base Rent will increase annually by the Base Rent Escalator (i.e. the lesser of (i) 3% or (ii) 200% of the change in CPI for the prior year) during the first five years of each Participating Lease term and, if the Lessee Performance Option is exercised, an additional five years thereafter from the date of exercise. Annual increases in Lease Payments are limited to 5% during the first five years of the initial lease terms. \"Gross Golf Revenue\" is generally defined as all revenues from a Golf Course including green fees, golf cart rentals, range fees, membership dues, membership initiation fees and transfer fees, excluding, however, food and beverage and merchandise revenue. For the recently opened Golf Courses, the base year Gross Golf Revenue is based on an estimate by the Company and the Initial Lessee of such courses, which estimate was also the basis for the valuation of those Golf Courses. Increases in the Lease Payments under the participating Leases are limited to 5% during the first five years.",
      "At a minimum, the Company will be paid rent of $54,000 per year ($4,500 per month) until January 31, 1998 unless the Wherehouse exercises its one time option to terminate the lease on March 31, 1998. If the lease is not terminated, the Company will be paid $82,800 per year ($6,900 per month) thereafter to January 31, 2003. The Amendment also provides that commencing January 20, 1997, the gross rent will be adjusted to an amount equal to 6.5% of gross sales from the previous eleven months, but such rent shall never be less than the rent paid during the said period. On April 20, 1998 and each three months thereafter, the gross rent will be adjusted to an amount equal to 8.2% of gross sales from the previous calendar quarter, but the rent shall never be less than the rent paid during the said quarter. At this time, the Company does not feel that the gross rent calculation will exceed the minimum rental amount payable in 1998. The Wherehouse will also pay for any percentage increase in property taxes over and above the amount assessed for calendar year 1996, on its pro rata share of occupied space of the property. The terms and conditions pertaining to options to renew the lease remain unmodified and are described below. As a result of the Amendment, the monthly rent payments (based on minimum rental amounts) was decreased from $1.28 per square foot to $.75 per square foot (or $4,500 per month) effective February 1, 1997. In addition, the Company expects to absorb an additional $18,000 in operating expenses that were previously allocated to The Wherehouse. The total decrease in income as a result of the Amendment is therefore estimated to be $38,160 per year until February 1, 1998 when the total decrease will be reduced to $28,800 per year. Based on approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company outstanding as of December 31, 1997, the Amendment decreased distributable income by approximately $.01 to $.02 per share per year in 1996 and 1997, and thus was not material to the operating results of the Company."

      "Hillard (1969) also reports the presence of alunite and montmorillinite. As reported by Hillard (1969), the surface exposure of the bertrandite mineralization occurs in altered rhyolite tuff along projected fault zones. The mineralized outcrop as identified by the USBM sampling program demarcates a zone of higher-grade bertrandite approximately 100 feet long and 30 feet wide, with additional historical drilling demonstrating mineralization to a depth of 190 feet. The historical USBM drill hole results indicate that mineralization is tightly confined to discrete, narrow zones. Hillard (1969) also reports a zone of weaker beryllium mineralization south of the main mineralized outcrop, which may be due to irregularities in the local fault geometry. Griffitts and Alminas (1968) suggest that the bertrandite was introduced into faulted volcanic rocks, and is unrelated to local base-metal mineralization. The host rock for the mineralization is hydrothermally altered rhyolite-tuff agglomerate, and Hillard (1969) reports that local beryllium “ore” consists of an altered rhyolite tuff fault breccia with a montmorillonite matrix. Coatings of bertrandite on the fault breccia and spheres of radiating bertrandite crystals in the fine fault material indicate that beryllium mineralization occurred after faulting. Exploration. We commenced exploration at our Warm Springs property in 2010. Our initial exploration efforts consisted of a phase one, 5-hole core drilling program designed to determine the boundaries of the beryllium mineralization and determined the extent and size of that mineralization. The first drill hole (location DH5) was completed to a depth of 1,000 feet. Five-foot interval samples were submitted to ALS Mineral for assay. Hole DH5 intersected a beryllium mineralized zone in excess of 100 feet in thickness. Maximum grades in the mineralized zone exceeded 1% as BeO.

No significant exploration is known to have been conducted on the Warm Springs property except for that described herein and previously by Griffitts and Alminas (1968), Hillard (1969) and Meeves (1966). Interpretation and Conclusions. Mineralization at Warm Springs is typical of volcanic-exhalative deposits. RC drilling on the property has confirmed the presence of anomalous beryllium mineralization associated with local faulting as previously reported by Meeves (1966), Griffitts and Alminas (1968) and Hillard (1969). Drill hole BE18A, located adjacent to the bertrandite mineralized outcrop, intercepted a zone of potentially economic mineralization over a distance of thirty feet at a depth of 160 feet, which combined with the results reported by Meeves (1966) suggests that beryllium mineralization associated with the mineralized bertrandite outcrop may continue at depth.",
      "From relative positioning and age dating it has been established that the earliest mineralizing event occurred between 20.5m.y. to 17m.y. before present. The later mineralization event occurred around the end of the emplacement of the Fraction Tuff. At Three Hills the gold bearing discontinuous, irregular, narrow, brecciated chalcedony quartz veinlets, and stockworks occur in a zone of pervasive silicification of the Siebert Formation immediately above the contact with the Fraction Tuff. At Hasbrouck, some gold-silver mineralization is seen within the Fraction Tuff, near its contact with the overlying Siebert formation, which hosts the bulk of the gold-silver mineralized veinlet and stockwork deposits. These occur as erratic bodies of hydrothermal breccia accompanied by strong pervasive silicification with associated adularia and pyrite. Adularia associated with mineralization at the Divide deposit was dated at between 16.3m.y. and 16.4 m.y. before present. ●Previous Exploration Work\nThis mine was cut in 1908 as far as our research could determine. But it was worked for 23 years prior to 1940. The mine appear to have been a medium-sized operation - maybe by 2 to 3 miners at the most based on the size of the workings. When part of the General Thomas Mine was split up into smaller properties for sale (owned by the Tonopah-Belcher Mining Co. at that time as well as the General Thomas Of Tonopah Co. before the split), this mine was likely called the Tonopah-Belcher Mine. Classified by a 1904 USGS report as a “past producer of Gold, Lead, Silver (Primary) and Copper (Secondary) -this area is a legendary part of Tonopah that has history dating as far back as 1863 when the district was founded. ●Exploration Plans\nRecent exploration phase for these properties has been completed. ●Sampling and Analysis\nTwenty-Three minerals were analyzed at each sample point by a Niton XL3T 980 GOLDD+ XRF. Values were recorded in ppm (parts per million) for each sample along with GIS coordinates from a Garmin E-trex 30x for georeferencing.",
      "The location of the USBM drill holes and trenches were not able to be verified in the field by the authors of the Technical Report. The accuracy and validity of the historical results were therefore not established by the authors of the Technical Report. A total of fourteen exploratory RC drill holes for a total of 7,576 feet were completed in 2001 and 2002 in the general vicinity of the bertrandite mineralized outcrop located by the USBM program. The Beryllium Group, LLC was in control of the project from 2001 to 2002. GWE was in control of the project from February 2004 to October 1, 2007. BE has been in control of the property since October 1, 2007. The initial six drill holes were completed and the remaining eight drill holes were sealed with a concrete plug with the exception of BE20 and BE25, which were left as water wells for the property owner. All drilling was done with a reverse circulation air-rig with six-inch down-the-hole hammer and tri-cone bit as required. Drill hole collar locations were determined by Mr. David Tognoni using a Magellan SporTrak Pro handheld GPS unit. No drill-hole surveys were undertaken. Regional Geology. The Warm Springs property lies within the eastern edge of the Datil-Mogollon volcanic field of southern New Mexico. The volcanic field consists of mafic to silicic extrusive units of Tertiary age and Quaternary basalts. The volcanic field is cut along its eastern margin by multiple north-striking normal faults which formed a series of eastward-tilted fault blocks in the Sierra Cuchillo. The Datil-Mogollon volcanic field is bordered on the east by the Rio Grande rift, where a series of rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs have been exposed. Beneath the ash-flow tuffs are latite conglomerates, mud-flow deposits and sandstones representing the alluvial apron which surrounded the Datil-Mogollon field prior to its ignimbrite climax. The base of the volcanic pile rests unconformably upon rocks ranging from late Eocene to Precambrian in age. Much of the area lies on the northeast flank of a major Laramide uplift from which the Mesozoic rocks were stripped by early Tertiary erosion."

    "question": "An insurance company's underwriting profit is calculated by dividing the difference between premiums earned and losses and expenses incurred by the total premiums earned. However, the company's combined ratio, which is a measure of underwriting profitability, is calculated by dividing the sum of losses and expenses incurred by premiums earned. If the company's loss and expense ratio is 120% in the first quarter of 2005, and the expense ratio is 32.6% in the same period, and considering that the company's reinsurance segment has a lower expense ratio of 25.8% in the first quarter of 2005, what is the combined ratio for the insurance company's property and casualty insurance segment, assuming that the loss and expense ratios are calculated on a GAAP basis?",

      "An underwriting profit indicates that a sufficient amount of premium income was received to cover the risks insured. An underwriting loss indicates that premium income was not adequate. The combined ratio is a measure utilized by insurance companies to gauge underwriting profitability and is calculated by dividing losses and expenses incurred by premiums earned. A number less than 100 generally indicates an underwriting gain; a number greater than 100 generally indicates an underwriting loss. Insurance companies collect cash in the form of insurance premiums and pay out cash in the form of loss and settlement expense payments. Additional cash outflows occur through the payment of acquisition and underwriting costs such as commissions, premium taxes, salaries and general overhead. During the loss settlement period, which varies by line of business and by the circumstances surrounding each claim and may cover several years, insurance companies invest the cash premiums and earn interest and dividend income. This investment income supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings. EMC INSURANCE GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED\n(Unaudited) Additional information regarding issues affecting the insurance industry is presented in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company's 2004 Form 10-K.\nMANAGEMENT ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES\nDuring the first quarter of 2005 management focused its attention on three primary issues affecting the Company. These issues include establishing and maintaining adequate loss and settlement expense reserves, balancing profitability and production as the insurance marketplace becomes increasingly competitive and preparing to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These issues are discussed further in the following paragraphs. A discussion of other issues affecting the Company is presented in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company's 2004 Form 10-K.\nManagement has long recognized the importance of adequate capitalization for its insurance subsidiaries and has strived to maintain a strong capital position by investing their assets conservatively and, more importantly, maintaining a consistent level of loss and settlement expense reserve adequacy.",
      "The Company received $1,357,000 and $1,576,000 of dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries and paid cash dividends to its stockholders totaling $2,039,000 and $1,730,000 in the first quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. EMC INSURANCE GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company's insurance company subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met; however, because of their participation in the pooling agreement and the quota share agreement, they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance or reinsurance company. This is due to the fact that under the terms of the pooling and quota share agreements, Employers Mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the Company's reinsurance subsidiary, and then settles the inter-company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis. At the insurance company subsidiary level, the primary sources of cash are premium income, investment income and maturing investments. The principal outflows of cash are payments of claims, commissions, premium taxes, operating expenses, income taxes, dividends, interest and principal payments on debt, and investment purchases. Cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses, either individually or in the aggregate. Accordingly, the insurance company subsidiaries maintain investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments. The Company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the availability of funds to pay claims and expenses.",
      "\" The following table reflects, on a GAAP basis, the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, expense ratios and combined ratios of the Syndicate and Alpine for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is calculated by dividing incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses (determined on a statutory or GAAP basis, as the case may be) by earned premium (determined on a statutory or GAAP basis). The statutory expense ratio is calculated by dividing net incurred other underwriting expenses by net written premium. The GAAP expense ratio is calculated by\ndividing policy acquisition costs amortized by earned premium. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio plus the expense ratio on both statutory and GAAP bases. During 1996, the Company reduced its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 1995. See \"-- Financial Reporting; Delisting of Common Stock\" and \"-- Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" The reduction in the reserves (approximately $14.9 million) took effect in 1995 and reduced the Company's 1995 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The Company's 1995 statutory expense ratio was increased by profit sharing expense related to the foregoing reduction in reserves. The cessation of the Company's writing of direct business in 1996 (without a corresponding immediate reduction in expenses) adversely affected the Company's 1996 statutory expense ratio and combined ratio. IRIS Ratios and Risk Based Capital. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") utilizes eleven Insurance Regulatory Information System (\"IRIS\") ratios and has developed a risk-based capital formula to assist regulators in evaluating insurer performance and capital adequacy. Alpine failed certain IRIS ratio tests in 1995 and 1996, and its policyholders' surplus fell below a regulatorily prescribed early warning level of risk based capital in 1995 and 1996. See \"-- Regulation -- Insurance Regulatory Information System Tests\" and \"-- Regulation -- Risk Based Capital.\"\nREGULATION\nExstar's insurance company subsidiary, Alpine, is subject to a substantial degree of regulation, which generally is designed to protect the interests of Alpine's policyholders.",
      "This increase is primarily attributed to the Company's increased participation in the pooling agreement. The expense ratio (acquisition and other expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned) decreased slightly to 32.6 percent in 2005 from 32.7 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower commission expenses in the reinsurance segment. For the property and casualty insurance segment, the expense ratio increased to 34.4 percent in the first quarter of 2005 from 34.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in policyholder dividends, which reflects improved underwriting results on eligible accounts, and to a much lesser extent, an increase in agents' profit share expense. The property and casualty insurance subsidiaries incurred $6,519,000 of commission expense in connection with the change in the pooling agreement. This commission expense is used to reimburse Employers Mutual for the expenses it incurred to generate the additional insurance business that was transferred to the Company on January 1, 2005. However, due to the fact that acquisition expenses, which include commissions, are deferred and amortized to expense as the related premiums are earned, all of the $6,519,000 of commission expense was capitalized as a deferred policy acquisition cost, and is being amortized to expense as the unearned premiums become earned. This provides a proper matching of acquisition expenses and premium income. EMC INSURANCE GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED\n(Unaudited) For the reinsurance segment, the expense ratio decreased to 25.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005 from 28.8 percent in the first quarter of 2004. This decrease is attributed to a decline in both commission and contingent commission expense reported by the MRB pool. The commission expense for 2004 includes $1,033,000 related to an increase in participation in the MRB pool from 25 percent to 33 percent; however, this expense was partially offset by an increase in the asset for deferred policy acquisition costs."

      "Three primary plays have been recognized within the basin. The first is a conventional structural, shallow sweet oil play of 35° API gravity. The Bukalara, Hayfield, Jamison, and Moroak sands (and perhaps the Bessie Creek sand along the western margin) have potential for oil and gas accumulations in trapped and sealed geometries. Most of the eleven previous wells drilled within the basin had oil and gas shows, and the Jamison No. 1 well tested oil on a Drill Stem Test. Detailed petrophysical analyses have been performed on all wells and have identified significant potential in some of these tests. The second play is an unconventional fractured shale play within the Kyalla and Velkerri formations, not unlike the Barnett Shale play in Texas, although the Barnett Shale is of Paleozoic age and the Velkerri is older, being of the Proterozoic age. It is unknown whether the hydrocarbons will be gas or oil (or possibly both) for this exploration target; however, the Barnett Shale model and algorithms in our petrophysical analyses of these shales suggest they are viable targets. The Barnett Shale is a Paleozoic (Mississippian) black shale in Texas that ranges from a few feet to over 1,000 feet but is generally considered most favorable where the Barnett is 300 feet or more and is thermally mature with vitrinite reflectance values greater than 1.1% (Ro≥1.1) 400 feet thick and has TOC of between 1-5 weight percentage averaging between 2.5% and 3.5%. Barnett wells are typically stimulated to induce fracturing or enhance fracturing. The Barnett where it is the thermal maturity window of a vitrinite reflectance of 1.1 or above is considered to be in the gas window and thus prospective. The Velkerri Shale in the Beetaloo Basin is up to 2438 feet (800 meters) thick, but the prospective portion of the Velkerri where TOCs range from 4 to 12% commonly in the 4-7% range in a 140 meter interval (or about 425 feet). The Velkerri Shale which is PreCambrian (approximately 1.4 billion years old) is in the gas window throughout much of the Beetaloo Basin with equivalent thermal maturity values of 1.1 or higher.",

Finally, the Moroak and Bessie Creek sandstones offer a Basin Centered Gas Accumulation (BCGA) play at the center of the basin. It is an unconventional resource play characterized by a lack of a gas/water contact. Petrophysical analyses of several wells previously drilled in the basin demonstrate the presence of a BCGA in the basin. We spudded the Sweetpea Shenandoah No. 1 well on July 31, 2007 and drilled to 4,724 feet. Intermediate casing was run on September 15, 2007 and the well was then suspended with an intention to deepen the well to a depth of 9,580 feet. Because of its proximity and geological similarity to the Balmain No. 1 well, the Company regards this well as a twin to the Balmain No. 1 well that was drilled by an unrelated third party in 1992. The original plan to drill the Shenandoah No. 1 well under-balanced with air was modified due to encountering a shallow-sand formation that produced excessive water. The well was drilled with air along with water and mud. Oil and gas hydrocarbon shows in the Hayfield Formation and Kyalla Shale were confirmed. The mudlog exhibits gas shows and fluorescence starting at about 1,900 feet, in the Hayfield Formation, and continuing through to present depth of 4,550 feet. Over 700 feet of hydrocarbon shows have been encountered. Geologically, the Shenandoah No. 1 well has matched its prognosis and the drilling results correlate with the Balmain No. 1 well. To date, seven drilling locations have been identified based on extensive geological and geophysical analysis."

Exploration Potential\nBased on airborne geophysical survey data, we have identified five magnetic targets within our controlled land holdings surrounding the Batman pit. The targets are distinct magnetic highs located within sedimentary rocks that should have a low magnetic signature. These features are similar to those at Mt Todd, which, as a result of the included pyrrhotite, exhibits a strong magnetic high. Mineralization at the Quigleys deposit is interpreted to occur within a series of mineralized shears that strike north northwest and dip 30 to 35 degrees to the west. The main shear extends for nearly one kilometer along the strike and has been drilled to a vertical depth of 230 meters.

South Louisiana Region. The Company's operations in south Louisiana include its royalty interests in St. Mary Parish and a number of large-target prospects located both on its fee lands and in separate prospect areas in south Louisiana. The south Louisiana region accounted for 5% of the Company's estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 1996 or 1.5 MMBOE (100% proved developed, 84% gas). Fee Lands. The Company owns approximately 24,900 acres of fee lands and associated mineral rights in St. Mary Parish, located approximately 85 miles southwest of New Orleans. St. Mary also owns a 25% working interest in approximately 300 acres located offshore and immediately south of the Company's fee lands. Since the initial discovery on the Company's fee lands in 1938, which established the Horseshoe Bayou Field, cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowner's royalties, to the Company from its south Louisiana properties have exceeded $200 million. St. Mary owns royalty interests on these lands, including production from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle Fields on its fee lands. Approximately 15,500 acres are leased or subject to lease options and 9,400 acres are presently unleased. The Company's principal lessees are Texaco, Vastar and Oryx. Since 1994, several factors have contributed to renewed development and exploration activity on the Company's fee lands. In 1991 the Company's lessees conducted two separate 3-D seismic surveys over portions of the Company's fee properties. Subsequent interpretation of this data by the lessees has contributed to expanded drilling activity in 1995 and 1996 on the Company's fee lands, including successful completion of seven new wells, 31 recompletions and 18 workovers during this two year period. In addition, during the same time period, St. Mary undertook an independent geological and engineering review of its fee properties and developed a\ncomprehensive technical data base.",

St. Mary also owns a 25% working interest in approximately 300 acres located offshore and immediately south of the Company's fee lands. Since the initial discovery on the Company's fee lands in 1938, cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowner's royalties, to the Company from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle Fields on its fee have exceeded $215 million. St. Mary currently leases 17,556 acres of its fee lands and has an additional 7,358 acres that are presently unleased. The Company's principal lessees are Texaco, Vastar, Oryx, Mobil and Sam Gary Jr. and Associates, a private exploration company headquartered in Denver. St. Mary has encouraged development drilling by its lessees, facilitated the origination of new prospects on acreage not held by production and stimulated exploration interest in deeper, untested horizons. The Company's major discovery on its fee lands at South Horseshoe Bayou in early 1997 and a subsequent successful confirmation well in early 1998 proved that significant accumulations of gas could be sourced and trapped at depths below 16,000 feet. Net production from the Company's fee lands increased by 13% in 1997 and 16% in 1996 as a result of the continuing development of the shallower formations on the property and production from the deep gas discovery at South Horseshoe Bayou. The Company's fee properties contributed approximately $8.8 million, or 11.6%, of St. Mary's gross oil and gas production revenues in 1997 and currently have gross production of over 60 MMcf and 1.8 MBbls per day. St. Mary granted 3,088 acres of new leases on its fee lands during 1997 and received associated cash bonus payments of $757,000. New leases provide the Company with a 25% royalty on all production and the option to participate as up to a 25% working interest owner. Accordingly, as in the case of the discovery and confirmation well at South Horseshoe Bayou, St. Mary bears 25% of the costs but receives approximately 40% of the revenues.",

In October 1995 the Company began participation as a working interest owner in its fee lands in St. Mary Parish with a 25% working interest in this project; resulting in a net revenue interest ranging from 36% to 40% due to its previously existing royalty position. The St. Mary Land & Exploration No. 1 well, under a turn-key contract, commenced drilling toward a target depth of 19,000 feet. In February 1996 this well began encountering severe pressure and mechanical problems that could not be corrected and in July 1996 the well was plugged without reaching total depth. The drilling rig was skid and the drilling of a new well commenced on the same site. In February 1997 the Company announced a significant deep gas discovery at the St. Mary Land & Exploration No. 2 well. This well was completed in the 17,300 foot sand, and in January 1998 a confirmation well, the St. Mary Land & Exploration No. 3, was completed in the same interval.",

      "For 2005, through a combination of equity for our actively managed retail partnerships and direct equity for AmREIT, ASC expects to raise approximately $120-$150 million directly through the independent financial planning community. Retail Partnerships\nAmREIT manages retail partnerships that sell limited partnership interests to retail investors, in which AmREIT indirectly invests as both the general partner and as a limited partner. The Company strives to create a structure that aligns the interests of our shareholders with those of our limited partners. These partnerships were formed to develop, own, manage, and add value to properties with an average holding period of two to four years. Value is created for AmREIT through our affiliates which serve as general partners of the retail partnerships. These general partners manage the partnerships and, in return, receive management fees as well as profit participation interests. The retail partnerships are structured so that the general partner, an affiliate of AmREIT, receives a significant profit only after the limited partners in the funds have received their targeted return, again, linking AmREIT’s success to that of its limited partners. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, AmREIT earned fees of $1.8 million, $634 thousand and $668 thousand, respectively, by providing real estate services to the retail partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, AmREIT directly managed, through its four actively managed retail partnerships, a total of $52.7 million in contributed capital. These four partnerships have or will enter their liquidation phases in 2003, 2008, 2010, and 2011, respectively. As these partnerships enter into liquidation, the Company, acting as the general partner, will receive economic benefit from our profit participation, after certain preferred returns have been paid to the partnerships’ limited partners. During 2004, AmREIT recognized approximately $869 thousand related to its general partner interest in AmREIT Opportunity Fund, Ltd. (AOF).",
      "During 2004, ASC raised approximately $25 million for AmREIT Monthly Income and Growth Fund II, Ltd., an affiliated retail partnership sponsored by a subsidiary of AmREIT. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company fully subscribed its class C common share offering which it started in August 2003. The offering was a $44 million offering ($40 million offered to the public and $4 million reserved for the dividend reinvestment program), issued on a best efforts basis through the independent financial planning and broker-dealer communities. The Company primarily used the proceeds for the acquisition of new properties and to pay down existing debt. ASC is also the dealer manager on our newest offering, a $170 million class D common share offering ($150 million offered to the public and $20 million reserved for the dividend re-investment program). This offering, a publicly registered, non-traded class of common shares with a stated yield of 6.5%, was launched on June 25, 2004. The class D common shares are convertible into our class A common shares after a seven-year lock out period at a 7.7% premium on invested capital and are callable by the Company after one year from the date of issuance. We have raised $20.9 million through this offering as of December 31, 2004, including shares issued through the dividend reinvestment program. Since capital is the lifeblood of any real estate company, having the unique opportunity to raise capital through both underwritten offerings and the independent financial planning community adds additional financial flexibility and dependability to our income stream. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, ASC generated securities commission revenues from capital-raising activities of $7.7 million, $3.0 million and $847 thousand, respectively. ASC incurred commission expenses of $5.9 million, $2.3 million and $653 thousand which were paid to non-affiliated broker-dealers in conjunction with such capital-raising activities.",
      "This property was owned 60% by us and 40% by an affiliated fund. The transaction was completed at fair market value pursuant to an independent appraisal process. We owned a 3% interest in the Woodlake Square property, a 205,522 square foot retail shopping center located in Houston, Texas, through a joint venture arrangement with affiliates of our General Partner, MIG IV (6% ownership interest) and ARIC (1% ownership interest) and an unaffiliated third party institutional partner (the remaining 90% ownership interest). The joint venture commenced redevelopment of this property in the third quarter of 2010 and completed the redevelopment in April 2011. On February 23, 2012, the joint venture sold a parcel of land that resulted in a gain of approximately $437,000. Our 3% share of this gain is included in our equity in losses from non-consolidated entities on our consolidated statement of operations. On September 18, 2013, the joint venture sold the shopping center to AmREIT for $41.6 million based on arm’s-length negotiations between AmREIT and our third party institutional partner that owned a 90% interest in the property. Our 3% ownership interest in the joint venture also included a promoted interest in cash flows once an 11.65% preferred return threshold was me on the project. The joint venture recorded a gain on sale of $10.4 million. Our share of this gain is included in our income (loss) from non-consolidated entities. We received a distribution of approximately $1.0 million in connection with this sale. Location of Properties and Concentration of Credit Risk\nWe have geographic concentration in our property holdings as all of our properties are located in Texas. The economies of the Texas metropolitan markets where we own investments have a significant impact on our cash flow and the value of our properties. Although a downturn in the economies of these metropolitan areas could adversely affect our business, general retail and grocery-anchored shopping centers that provide necessity-type items tend to be less sensitive to macroeconomic downturns."

      "Marketing assumptions allow for our internal consumption of TiO2 feedstocks, and future sales prices for mineral products. Mining cost assumptions are based on operating expenses for comparable extraction methods at our operating mines and heavy mineral processing experience at our three mine support products facilities and costs for conversion of ilmenite to slag and pig iron in South Africa and to synthetic rutile in Western Australia. Heavy Mineral Reserves\nAt December 31, 2014, our total HM reserves were approximately 1.26 billion metric tons (“MT”) of ore at a group-wide, weight-averaged grade of 6.7% total heavy mineral (“THM”), or a total in-place reserve of 69.4 million MT contained THM. Our group-wide estimated in-place valuable heavy minerals amount to 31.5 million MT of ilmenite, 5.4 million MT of rutile and leucoxene, and 6.7 million MT of zircon. Recoveries of valuable heavy minerals vary widely, and our reserve estimates account for VHM losses during mining and processing. Other than titanium minerals and zircon, other minerals of potential value are often present to variable degrees in our HM reserves. No speculative values from these by-product minerals have been factored into our reserve estimates. The following table summarizes our heavy mineral ore reserves and their contained in situ THM and heavy mineral assemblages as of December 31, 2014. Downward or upward movements in our total heavy mineral estimates from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 are indicated. Notations for the above HM reserves table:\nMT - All measures of mass are expressed in MT, including Ore Reserves based on the in-place content of THM. ORE RESERVES - The portions of our inventories of mineralized material that can be economically and legally mined and processed at the time of the reserves determination. Reserves are supported by iterative technical and economic evaluations that allow for mining and processing recoveries and estimated costs, marketing costs and assumptions, environmental, regulatory, social and other relevant factors.",
      "The economic modeling determines extraction boundaries based on positive future cash flows from commercial minerals (zircon, rutile, leucoxene, non-integrated ilmenite) and upgraded ilmenite products (Ti-slag, synthetic rutile, pig iron), net of mining and processing costs. Marketing assumptions allow for our internal consumption of TiO2 feedstocks, and future sales prices for mineral products. Mining cost assumptions are based on operating expenses for comparable extraction methods at our operating mines and heavy mineral processing experience at our three mine support products facilities and costs for conversion of ilmenite to slag and pig iron in South Africa and to synthetic rutile in Western Australia. Commercial sales of our mineral concentrates and processed mineral products are sold under long-term and short-term private contracts, the terms of which are confidential. The TiO2 industry is an oligopolistic market, and a public disclosure of contractual unit prices could be detrimental to our relationships with our customers. We do not believe that historic sales prices are reliable indicators for future prices, and we apply forward-looking sales price assumptions based on our long-term contract prices, internal market intelligence, and forecasts by independent industry research consultancies such as TZ Minerals International Pty Ltd (“TZMI”).

Based on average total HM assemblage data, the in-place reserves contain approximately 31 million MT of ilmenite, approximately 5 million MT of combined rutile and leucoxene, and approximately 6 million MT of zircon, for a total VHM content of approximately 42 million MT.\nReported reserve estimates in the table below are in-place portions of inventories of mineralized material that have been previously classified as Measured Resources or Indicated Resources under the SAMREC or JORC codes.",
      "Abbreviations, Definitions, and Notations\nOne metric tonne = 1.10231 short tons) Ore Reserves -the portions of our inventories of mineralized material inclusive of dilution, determined to be economically and legally exploitable as of December 31, 2019, classified as either Probable Reserves or Proven Reserves, based on level of confidence. THM - total heavy minerals, densities >2.85 g/cm3 regardless of commercial value\nVHM - valuable heavy minerals, including Ilmenite, Rutile, Leucoxene & Zircon, reported as percentage of THM. Change from 2018 - Increase (decrease) in percent change of in-place THM from 2018\nKey Assumptions - economic viability is determined by techno-economic modeling constructed from geological, analytical and geotechnical databases, mining parameters, metallurgical recovery assumptions, pit optimizations, and economic assumptions based on current operating costs, foreign exchange rates, and projected product sales prices at time of production. Historical sales prices by themselves are unreliable predictors of future prices, and our revenue forecasts are based on multiple factors, including market research, existing private contracts, and external consultant opinions. Our forecast production of commercial-quality titanium mineral and zircon concentrates from reserves is based on mining rates, the heavy mineral assemblage and grade distributions, our experience in valuable mineral recoveries, and other inputs to our techno-economic models. Mining recoveries are typically high but metallurgical recoveries vary widely as a function of mineral characteristics. Processing efficiencies are affected by many factors, including mineralogical diversity, grain size, morphology and surface coatings of the heavy minerals. To a practical extent, mineral separation technology is customized for each mining operation. Cumulative recovery factors for VHM in our mine feeds, inclusive of VHM concentration at the mine and production of mineral concentrates at the separation plant, are generally in the range of 60% to 90%.",
      "All commercial products, including slag feed to our own TiO2 pigment plants, are exported from Richards Bay. The following table compares the heavy mineral reserves reported for the three years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: The above three -year total heavy mineral reserves for the Tronox Mineral Sands Division are expressed as millions of MT in-place THM for the years ended 2014 through 2016. Life-of-Mine Plans for each operation may include some non-reserve mineralized material not currently determined to be reserves under the guidelines of SEC Industry Guide 7, and the mine lives in the LOMPs may be longer than what can be supported by the reserves. At current mining rates, our reserves can sustain mining for over 25 years at Namakwa, over 12 years at KZN, and over 20 years in Western Australia. HM Deposit Geology and Mining Operations\nOur vertical integrated TiO2 business is anchored by our three large heavy mineral mining and processing operations: Namakwa Sands and KZN Sands on the West Coast and East Coast, respectively, of South Africa and Tronox Western Australia. HMs are defined by densities of at least 2.9 grams per cm3, and heavy mineral placers are accumulations of high-density minerals sufficiently durable to survive erosion and water transport to co-depositional sites, as a consequence of their similar hydrodynamic characteristics. However, placers of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile accompanied by significant percentages of zircon (ZrSiO4) are a distinctive class of heavy mineral deposit that provides most of the world’s supply of titanium and zirconium raw materials. Index\nAll ore deposits are accidents of geology resulting from unusual circumstances, and deposits with long-term mine lives are rare. Our three integrated mineral sands operations are based on large HM deposits of high-quality heavy minerals. These resources are examples of coastal plain Ti-Zr heavy mineral deposits, but their individual mineralogy, ore characteristics and extraction methods are different."

(1) Proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in-house and are subject to periodic audit by others, although audits are not performed on an annual basis. Associated Mining Consultants, Ltd. completed an independent audit of the 2004 year-end reserves at Mina Isidora in 2005. Our estimates of proven and probable reserves were based on a gold price of $500, $400 and $350 per ounce, respectively, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. (2) Proven and probable ore reserves at Mina Isidora are based on diamond drill hole spacing of 30 to 35 meters, and estimated using geostatistical modeling. Cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices, anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs. (3) The changes to the Mina Isidora ore reserves in 2006 compared to 2005 are attributed to additional drill data, changes in modeling techniques, changes in mining assumptions, mining depletion and costs. The cutoff grade at Isidora is 0.26 ounces of gold per ton. Exploration work at Mina Isidora in 2007 will include drilling of known mineralized zones to determine if these areas could be mineable. In addition, exploration will be performed to the west along strike of the Isidora trend and to a depth of approximately 100 to 150 meters below the known mineralization. Outside the Mina Isidora area, other exploration work on the Block B concessions included geologic mapping, geophysical surveying, geochemical sampling and 20,000 meters of exploration diamond drilling. This work lead to the discovery of two mineralized zones, the Twin and Conductora mineralized zones, located approximately one-kilometer northeast of the Mina Isidora orebody. The Twin structure was discovered through drilling during in the second quarter of 2004, and is host to a large mineralized zone known as the Twin mineralized zone.",

Associated Mining Consultants, Ltd., whom has referred to Mina Isidora as “the Isidora Gold Project” within their consent included as exhibit 23.5 to this document, completed an independent audit of the 2003 year-end reserves at Mina Isidora in 2004. Our estimates of proven and probable reserves were based on a gold price of $400, $350 and $335 per ounce, respectively, in 2005, 2004 and 2003. (2)\nProven and probable ore reserves at Mina Isidora are based on diamond drill hole spacing of 30 to 35 meters, geostatistical modeling.

(3) The changes to the Mina Isidora ore reserves in 2005 compared to 2004 are attributed to additional drill data, changes in modeling techniques, changes in mining assumptions and costs. The cutoff grade at Isidora is 12 grams of gold per tonne. Outside the Mina Isidora area, other exploration work on the Block B concessions has included geologic mapping, geophysical surveying, geochemical sampling and 20,000 meters of exploration diamond drilling. This work has lead to the discovery of two mineralized zones, the Twin and Conductora mineralized zones, located approximately one-kilometer northeast of the Mina Isidora orebody.

The Twin mineralized zone has a minimum strike length of 750 meters and a minimum vertical extent of 350 meters, and is still open down dip and along strike. Mineralization is somewhat erratic with values ranging from three grams per tonne to over 18 grams per tonne and widths from one meter to over 20 meters. The gold mineralization is associated with disseminated pyrite in a moderate-to-strong schistose shear zone, with moderate-to-intense ankerite/sericite alteration and minor quartz veining.",

In addition, there were 32 employees contracted to fill-in for vacation and absentee purposes, and 38 employees at the administrative office in Puerto Ordaz as of December 31, 2006. Information with respect to the La Camorra mine’s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below. (1) The company’s estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on a gold price of $500, $400 and $350 per ounce, respectively, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in-house and are subject to periodic audit by others, although audits are not performed on an annual basis. An independent audit of the 2004 year-end reserves at the La Camorra mine was completed in 2005 by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc (“RPA”). (2) The 2006 year-end proven and probable reserves decrease in tonnage and grade, as well as an associated decrease in ounces when compared to the 2005 year-end proven and probable reserves, are a result of mining depletion of 114,044 tons in 2006, not extending reserve limits in 2006 and encountering lower than expected grade in development areas compared to the grade estimated in the 2005 reserve estimate. (3) The 2005 year-end reserves show an increase in tonnage and decrease in grade resulting in a decrease in ounces when compared to the 2004 year-end reserves. The changes resulted from a combination of new drill data and underground sampling information, a revision of ore shoot limits and the increase in mine dilution being applied to the Betzy vein material together with a depletion of reserves by mining. (4) At the end of 2006, the La Camorra mine development of the vein system is complete within 25 meters vertical of the reserve limit. Accordingly, proven and probable ore reserve estimates at the La Camorra mine are primarily based on polygonal estimates from development headings and drilling with spacing of 30 to 50 meters.",
      "(2)\nProven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in-house and are subject to periodic audit by others, although audits are not performed on an annual basis. Our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices:\n(3)\nReserves are in-place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery. Mill recoveries are expected to be 93% for silver, 93% for lead and 76% for zinc. (4)\nWe are currently developing the 5900 level, which is expected to reach full production levels in mid-2006. Due to increased data made possible from this development, proven and probable reserves reported at December 31, 2005, doubled after accounting for production during 2005. (5)\nThe changes in reserves in 2004 versus 2003 are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices, which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates, partially offset by depletion due to production. Ultimate reclamation activities contemplated include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas. No final reclamation activities were performed in 2005, and at December 31, 2005, approximately $0.5 million had been accrued for reclamation and closure costs. The net book value of the Lucky Friday unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately $15.6 million as of December 31, 2005. The construction of the facilities at Lucky Friday ranges from the 1950s to 2005, and are in good physical condition. In 2005, we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries. Additions included a third-stage crushing system, increased flotation capacity and a new flash cell, new column cells and tailings thickeners. The plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside trade specialists as required. At December 31, 2005, there were 171 employees at the Lucky Friday unit."

      "The Company charges nominal financing fees on late payments. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for bad debts when the Company has exhausted all reasonable means of collection. At December 31, 2012, Management deemed that an allowance of $23,425 should be recorded based on expected collections. Inventory - Inventory consists of finished units, parts and packaging materials and is stated at lower of historical cost or current cost. Management will establish a reserve for damaged and discontinued inventory when determined necessary. At December 31, 2012 no reserve was required. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at historical cost, which consists of the net book value of the assets carried on the prior company's books. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method generally over a 3- to 5-year period. Leasehold improvements will be amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the related lease. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the account and any gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations. Depreciation expense for property and equipment is recorded as either cost of goods sold or general and administrative expense, depending on the use of the assets. Stock Offering Costs - During 2010 and 2011, the Company recorded the organizational costs associated with the private placement offering as additional paid in capital and expensed the costs associated with taking the company public. Impairment of Long Lived Assets - The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment, in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flow on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related assets."

Below is a breakdown of square feet by location and use as of December 31, 2002. OFFICE SPACE\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of the Merchandise Mart Properties office revenues by tenants' industry during 2002: The average lease term ranges from three to five years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for large tenants. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenants' share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for a building over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a submetered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. None of the tenants in the Merchandise Mart Properties segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenue. Below is a listing of the Merchandise Mart Properties office tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Merchandise Mart Properties' revenues in 2002:\nOn December 30, 2002, the Company entered into a lease modification agreement with Bankers Life and Casualty (\"Bankers\") to (i) extend the term for 107,000 square feet from November 30, 2008 (the date it was scheduled to expire) to November 30, 2018, (ii) maintain 70,000 square feet through November 30, 2008, (iii) surrender 83,000 square feet on March 1, 2003, (which the Company has re-leased to RBC Mortgage Company for a 15-year term) and (iv) vacate the remaining 43,000 square feet. Bankers is not part of the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Conseco.

      "FEDERAL REGULATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE\nThe most significant federal environmental laws affecting the Company are RCRA, the Superfund Act and the Clean Water Act. RCRA. RCRA is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA has established a comprehensive, \"cradle-to-grave\" system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous waste. States, such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Ohio, that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA, have been authorized by the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA's program. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA license from the EPA or an authorized state agency and must comply with certain operating requirements. Under RCRA, hazardous waste management facilities in existence on November 19, 1980 were required to submit a preliminary license application to the EPA, the so-called Part A Application. By virtue of this filing, a facility obtained Interim Status, allowing it to operate until licensing proceedings are instituted pursuant to more comprehensive and exacting regulations (the Part B licensing process). Interim Status facilities may continue to operate pursuant to the Part A Application until their Part B licensing process is concluded. Of the Company's eleven waste management facilities, eight are subject to RCRA licensing; of the eight, only the Virginia waste oil facility operates under interim status. The other seven have been issued Part B licenses, one of which is under appeal. RCRA requires that Part B licenses contain a schedule of required on-site study and cleanup activities, known as \"corrective action,\" including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility. The EPA estimates that there are approximately 4,300 facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes, which can be compelled to take corrective action when necessary.",
      "Accordingly, the hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal activities of the Company's Braintree, Natick, Woburn, Bristol, Chicago, Baltimore and Cincinnati facilities are regulated by the relevant state agencies in addition to federal EPA regulation. Some states, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts, classify as hazardous some wastes which are not regulated under RCRA. For example, Massachusetts considers PCBs and used oil as \"hazardous wastes,\" while RCRA does not. Accordingly, the Company must comply with state requirements for handling state regulated wastes, and when necessary obtain state licenses for treating, storing, and disposing of such wastes at its facilities. The Company believes that each of its facilities is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of RCRA and state laws and regulations. Ten of the Company's eleven waste management facilities have been issued final licenses; the one for the Braintree facility is under appeal. The Richmond facility operates under interim status. Once issued, such licenses have maximum fixed terms of a given number of years, which differ from state to state, ranging from three years to ten years. The issuing state agency may review or modify a license at any time during its term. The Company anticipates that once a license is issued with respect to a facility, the license will be renewed at the end of its term if the facility's operations are in compliance with applicable requirements. However, there can be no assurance that regulations governing future licensing will remain static, or that the Company will be able to comply with such requirements. The Company's wastewater treatment facilities are also subject to state and local regulation, most significantly sewer discharge regulations adopted by the municipalities which receive treated wastewater from the treatment processes. The Company's continued ability to operate its liquid waste treatment process at each such facility is dependent upon its ability to continue these sewer discharges."
