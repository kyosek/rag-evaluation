Passage 1:
Hedwig of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
Hedwig of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (Hedwig Eleonore; 12 January 1666 – 9 August 1735), was a German noblewoman member of the House of Mecklenburg and by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Merseburg-Zörbig.
Born in Güstrow, she was the eighth of eleven children born from the marriage of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Magdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp.

Passage 2:
Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg [-Güstrow] (26 February 1633 – 6 October 1695) was the last ruler of Mecklenburg-Güstrow from 1636 until his death and last Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg from 1636 to 1648.

Life
Gustav Adolph was born at the ducal residence in Güstrow, the son of Duke John Albert II and his third wife Eleonore Marie (1600–1657), daughter of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg.
As Gustav Adolph was a minor when his father died in 1636, his uncle Duke Adolph Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin at first became regent at Güstrow. This was fiercely opposed by Gustav Adolph's mother. In 1654 he came of age and married Magdalene Sibylle, a daughter of Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp. Their marriage produced eleven children:

Johann, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (2 December 1655 – 6 February 1660).
Eleonore (1 June 1657 – 24 February 1672).
Marie (June 19, 1659 – 6 January 1701), married on 23 September 1684 to Duke Adolph Frederick II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
Magdalene (5 July 1660 – 19 February 1702).
Sophie (21 June 1662 – 1 June 1738), married on 6 December 1700 to Duke Christian Ulrich I of Württemberg-Oels.
Christine (14 August 1663 – 3 August 1749), married on 4 May 1683 to Louis Christian, Count of Stolberg-Gedern.
Charles, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (18 November 1664 – 15 March 1688), married on 10 August 1687 to Marie Amalie of Brandenburg, a daughter of Elector Frederick William.
Hedwig (12 January 1666 – 9 August 1735), married on 1 December 1686 to Duke August of Saxe-Merseburg-Zörbig.
Louise (28 August 1667 – 15 March 1721), married on 5 December 1696 to King Frederick IV of Denmark.
Elisabeth (3 September 1668 – 25 August 1738), married on 29 March 1692 to Duke Henry of Saxe-Merseburg-Spremberg.
Augusta (27 December 1674 – 19 May 1756).The death of the only surviving son, the Hereditary Prince Charles, in 1688 at the age of 23, caused a succession crisis in Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Gustav Adolph's daughter Marie married her cousin Adolphus Frederick II of Mecklenburg, who after the death of his father-in-law claimed the Güstrow heritage, but could not prevail against the ruling duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. A younger daughter, Louise in 1695 married the Danish crown prince Frederick IV and in 1699 became queen consort of Denmark.
Gustav Adolph died in Güstrow at the age of 62. The subsequent inheritance conflict within the House of Mecklenburg was settled by the establishment of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1701.
Passage 3:
John Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg
John Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg[-Güstrow] (5 May 1590 in Waren – 23 April 1636 in Güstrow) was a Duke of Mecklenburg.  From 1608 to 1611, he was the nominal ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the actual ruler being the regent, his great-uncle Charles I.  From 1611 to 1621 John Albert and his brother Adolf Frederick I jointly ruled the whole Duchy of Mecklenburg.  From 1621, John Albert ruled Mecklenburg-Güstrow alone.

Life
John Albert was the son of Duke John VII and Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp.
He reigned from 16 April 1608, under the regency of his great-uncle Duke Charles I, jointly with his brother Adolf Frederick I in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin part of the country.  After Charles's death, the Emperor declared Adolf Frederick an adult and he ruled alone until John Albert came of age and they began to rule jointly.
In 1617 he converted to Protestantism. In the division of Mecklenburg of 1621, John Albert received Mecklenburg-Güstrow.
In 1623, both brothers joined a defensive alliance of the Lower Saxon Estates.  They tried to seem neutral during the Thirty Years' War, but they secretly supported the Danish troops of king Christian IV.  After the Imperial side won the Battle of Lutter, Tilly treated them as enemies.  On 19 January 1628, Emperor Ferdinand II issue a decree at Brandýs Castle declaring that the brothers had forfeited their fief and that Mecklenburg would be invested to Wallenstein.  In May 1628, the brothers left the Duchy, at the request of Wallenstein.  In May 1631, Wallenstein was overthrown by Swedish troops, and the brothers returned.
John Albert II died in 1636 and was buried in the Minster in Güstrow.

Marriage and issue
John Albert II was married three times.
(I) On 9 October 1608 he married Margaret Elizabeth (11 July, 1584 – 16 November, 1616), daughter of Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg.  The couple had the following children:

Passage 4:
Frederick IV of Denmark
Frederick IV (Danish: Frederik; 11 October 1671 – 12 October 1730) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1699 until his death. Frederick was the son of Christian V of Denmark-Norway and his wife Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel.

Early life
Frederick was born on 11 October 1671 at Copenhagen Castle as the eldest son of King Christian V and his spouse Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel. The newborn prince was baptised the same evening with the name Frederick by the royal confessor Hans Leth. His grandfather King Frederick III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the ruling King he was thus Crown Prince from birth. At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.
As Crown Prince, Frederick broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-storey building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.
Frederick was allowed to choose his future wife from a number of Protestant royal daughters in northern Germany. In 1695, he visited the court of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow in Güstrow. But his visit there was cut short by a message telling of his brother Prince Christian's serious illness (he had, in fact, already died in Ulm). Frederick later returned to Güstrow, where he was forced to choose the eldest of the unmarried princesses. On 5 December 1695 at Copenhagen Castle, he married Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, herself a great-great-granddaughter of Frederick II of Denmark. 
At the death of Christian V on 25 August 1699, the couple became King and Queen of Denmark-Norway. They were crowned on 15 April 1700 in the chapel of Frederiksborg Palace.

Reign
Domestic rule
Frederick's most important domestic reform was the abolition in 1702 of the so-called vornedskab, a kind of serfdom which had applied to the peasants of Zealand since the Late Middle Ages. His efforts were largely in vain because of the introduction in 1733 of adscription (stavnsbånd), a law that forced peasants to remain in their home regions, by which the peasantry were subjected to both the local nobility and the army.After the Great Northern War, trade and culture flowered. The first Danish theatre, Lille Grønnegade Theatre, was created and the great dramatist Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) began his career. He established the College of Missions which funded the missionary Hans Egede (1686–1758) in taking forward the colonisation of Greenland. Politically this period was marked by the King's connection to the Reventlows, the Holsteiner relatives of his second queen, and by his growing suspicion of the old nobility.During Frederick's rule Copenhagen was struck by two disasters: the plague of 1711, and the great fire of October 1728, which destroyed most of the medieval capital.  The King had been persuaded by astronomer Ole Rømer (1644–1710) to introduce the Gregorian calendar in Denmark-Norway in 1700, but the astronomer's observations and calculations were among the treasures lost to the fire.Frederik IV, having twice visited Italy, had two pleasure palaces built in the Italian baroque style: Frederiksberg Palace was extended during his reign, when it was converted into a three-storey H-shaped building, completed in 1709 by Johan Conrad Ernst, giving the palace a true Italian baroque appearance and Fredensborg Palace, both considered monuments to the conclusion of the Great Northern War.

Venetian journey
Frederick IV holds a memorable place in the social history of the city of Venice due to a visit he made during the winter of 1708–09. The King stayed in the city with an entourage of at least 70 people, formally incognito as Count of Oldenburg, not to be unknown, but in order to avoid the cumbersome and costly etiquette of a royal visit. During his nine-week stay, the King was a frequent guest at operas and comedies and a generous buyer of Venetian glass. During the visit to the state armoury, he received the republic's gift: two large ore guns and an ore mortar. A regatta on the Grand Canal was held in his honour and is immortalised in a painting by Luca Carlevarijs. The winter that year was particularly cold, so cold that the lagoon of Venice froze over, and the Venetians were able to walk from the city to the mainland. It was joked that the king of Denmark had brought the cold weather with him. He also paid a visit to the dowager grand-princess Violante at the grand-ducal court of the Medicis.

Foreign affairs
On his return from he led political negotiations with the Elector Augustus of Saxony and Frederick I of Prussia about the impending plans of war against Sweden. For much of Frederick IV's reign Denmark-Norway was engaged in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) against Sweden. In spite of the conclusion of the Peace of Travendal in 1700, there was soon a Swedish invasion and threats from Europe's western naval powers. In 1709 Denmark again entered the war, encouraged by the Swedish defeat at Poltava. Frederick IV commanded the Danish troops at the Battle of Gadebusch in 1712. Although Denmark-Norway emerged on the victorious side, she failed to regain her lost possessions in southern Sweden. The most important result was the destruction of the pro-Swedish Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which re-established Denmark's domination in Schleswig-Holstein. Between 1703 and 1711, Frederick sent military units to Hungary and supported Austria in the Rákóczi's War of Independence. The Danish regiments fought against the Kuruc army and French auxiliaries (Battle of Zsibó).
Much of the King's life was spent in strife with kinsmen. Two of his first cousins, Charles XII of Sweden and Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (the three men were the grandsons of Frederick III of Denmark), had waged war upon his father jointly. Initially defeated by the Swedes and forced to recognise the independence of Holstein-Gottorp, Frederick finally drove the next duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Duke Charles Frederick (who was Frederick IV's first cousin once removed) out of Schleswig in 1713, and avoided the revenge contemplated by Charles Frederick's mother-in-law, Catherine I of Russia.

Personal life
Frederick was deemed a man of responsibility and industry — often regarded as the most intelligent of Denmark-Norway's absolute monarchs. He seems to have mastered the art of remaining independent of his ministers. Lacking all interest in academic knowledge, he was nevertheless a patron of culture, especially art and architecture. His main weaknesses were probably pleasure-seeking and womanising, which sometimes distracted him. He was the penultimate Danish king to make a morganatic marriage (the last was Frederick VII with Louise Rasmussen aka "Countess Danner").

 Without divorcing Queen Louise, in 1703 he married Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg (d.1704). After the death of Elisabeth, he entered into a romance with her lady-in-waiting Charlotte Helene von Schindel, though he later lost interest in her. In 1711, Frederick fell in love with 19-year-old Countess Anne Sophie Reventlow, daughter of the then Grand-Chancellor Conrad von Reventlow. He carried her off from her home, Clausholm Castle near Randers, after her mother refused to let her daughter be a royal mistress. Frederick had seen Anne Sophie at a masquerade ball at Koldinghus, where the royal family resided during the plague that devastated Copenhagen. A secret marriage was held at Skanderborg on 26 June 1712. At that time he accorded her the title "Duchess of Schleswig" (derived from one of his own subsidiary titles). Three weeks after Queen Louise's death in Copenhagen on 4 April 1721, he legalised his relationship with Anna Sophie by a new marriage, this time declaring her queen consort (the only wife of a hereditary Danish king to bear that title who was not a princess by birth). It was undoubtedly a relief to regularise a relationship they both saw as sinful. Of the nine children born to him of these three wives, only two of them survived to adulthood: the future Christian VI and Princess Charlotte-Amalia, both from the first marriage. All the other children died in infancy.The Reventlows took advantage of their kinship to the King. Anna's sister, the salonist Countess Christine Sophie Holstein of Holsteinborg, was nicknamed Madame Chancellor because of her influence. Within a year of making Anna Queen, Frederick also recognized as dynastic the issue of the morganatic marriages of two of her kinsmen, Duke Philip Ernest of Schleswig-Holstein-Glucksburg (1673–1729) and Duke Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Plön-Norburg (1674–1706), to non-royal nobles. The other Schleswig-Holstein dukes of the House of Oldenburg perceived their interests to be injured, and Frederick found himself embroiled in complicated lawsuits and petitions to the Holy Roman Emperor. Also offended by the Countess's elevation were Frederick's younger unmarried siblings, Princess Sophia Hedwig (1677–1735) and Prince Charles (1680–1729), who withdrew from Copenhagen to their own rival court at the handsomely re-modelled Vemmetofte Cloister (later a haven for dowerless damsels of the nobility).

Later life
During the King's last years he had dropsy (oedema), and was also affected by the consequences of an accident in an explosion in a cannon foundry in Copenhagen. He also had private sorrows that inclined him toward Pietism, a form of faith that would rise to prevalence during the reign of his son. During his last years, Frederick IV asked for the loyalty of his son in order to protect Queen Anna Sophie. Despite the growing weakness, he set in 1730 on a muster travel; he reached Gottorp but had to return, and died in Odense, on the day after his 59th birthday. He was buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the site of the mausoleum of Danish royalty.

Passage 5:
Ulrich, Duke of Mecklenburg
Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg or Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (5 March 1527 – 14 March 1603) was Duke of Mecklenburg (-Güstrow) from 1555-56 to 1603.

Early life
Ulrich was the third son of Duke Albrecht VII and Anna of Brandenburg.  Ulrich was educated at the Bavarian court. Later, he studied theology and law in Ingolstadt.  After the death of his father, he took up residence in Bützow and succeeded his cousin Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin as Lutheran administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin in 1550.  Later, he married Magnus's widow, Elizabeth, a daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark. His wife was actually a first cousin of his maternal grandmother Elizabeth of Denmark, daughter of John, King of Denmark. They were first cousins, twice removed. After the death of Elizabeth he married Anna, daughter of Philip I, Duke of Pomerania.
After the death of his uncle, Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg, Ulrich participated in the national government, especially during Mecklenburg's participation in the Schmalkaldic War.  It erupted from an inheritance dispute, which was settled by the "Ruppiner dictum" of the Elector of Brandenburg.

Reign
On 17 February 1555, Ulrich succeeded his brother John Albert I in partitioned Mecklenburg-Güstrow. In 1556, he received, while maintaining common state government with his brother, the eastern part of Mecklenburg with the capital in Güstrow, while John Albert received the western part with the residence Schwerin.  After the death of his brother in 1576, Ulrich was made guardian of his offspring, among them his nephew and successor in Güstrow John Albert II.  Ulrich built the castle at Güstrow as his principal residence.  
Ulrich embodied an educated, modern prince, and was a devout Lutheran.  He developed into one of the leading princes of  the Mecklenburg dynasty.  He left behind, at his death, a fortune of about 200,000 guilders.  Ulrich participated in the exchange with Tycho Brahe and David Chytraeus in the scientific discourse of his time and corresponded with humanists like Heinrich Rantzau. In 1594, as Chief of Lower Saxony imperial circle, he organized military and financial assistance against the Turkish threat. 
In the dispute between Frederick II of Denmark and his brother-in-law Duke John Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp Ulrich served as a mediator, having excellent relations to both. As Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin he was succeeded by his grandson the last Bishop of Schleswig, Prince Ulrich of Denmark (30 December 1578 – 27 March 1624 in Rühn), who married with Lady Catherine Hahn-Hinrichshagen.
Ulrich's granddaughter Anne of Denmark married James VI of Scotland. In 1598 James VI was anxious to secure the throne of England. He sent his ambassadors to his wife's family and allies, to discuss his right to Elizabeth's throne and that the Princes of Europe should supported him against Spanish claims, with military help if required. Ulrich wrote to James on 20 August with a letter of cautious support, counselling that Elizabeth should name him her successor, and was lukewarm on a definite pledge of arms.

Family
Ulrich's only child from his marriage to Elizabeth of Denmark, Sophie, married King Frederick II of Denmark. Through her, Ulrich was a grandfather to Christian IV of Denmark and a great-grandfather of Charles I of England.
Passage 6:
Christine of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
Christine of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (14 August 1663 – 3 August 1749) was a German noblewoman of the House of Mecklenburg and by marriage Countess of Stolberg-Gedern.
Born in Güstrow, she was the sixth of eleven children born from the marriage of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Magdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp.

Passage 7:
Charles of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
Karl, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (18 November 1664 in Güstrow – 15 March 1688 in Güstrow) was the hereditary prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.  He was a son of Gustavus Adolph and his wife Magdalene Sibylle née Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, a daughter of Frederick III.

Life
Charles married on 10 August 1687 in Potsdam to Marie Amalie of Brandenburg, the daughter of the "Great Elector" Frederick William of Brandenburg.  The marriage remained childless.  He died unexpectedly of smallpox.  He was the last surviving son of his father, and his wife lost her child when she learned of his fate, so that the Mecklenburg-Güstrow line died out when his father died in 1695.
His brother-in-law, Duke Adolf Frederick II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz claimed Mecklenburg-Güstrow.  However Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin disagreed and the legal situation was unclear, leading to a long succession dispute.  The dispute was settled in the Partition of Hamburg, in which the relationship between Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz was redefined and Mecklenburg-Güstrow was given to Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Passage 8:
Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (28 August 1667 – 15 March 1721) was Queen of Denmark and Norway as the first spouse of King Frederick IV of Denmark.  In 1708–09, she was regent during her husband's trip to Italy.

Early life
Louise was born in Güstrow in the family of Duke Gustav Adolph of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Duchess Magdalena Sibylla of Holstein-Gottorp as a great-great-granddaughter of Frederick II of Denmark. Louise grew up into a tiny court characterized by pietistic feelings and rigid religiosity, led by her father, who wrote religious songs in pietistic spirit.
In 1695, Louise was selected by Crown Prince Frederick as his bride.  When it was deemed time for Frederick to marry and provide and heir to the throne, he was sent to a journey to Germany to choose a bride from some of the Protestant Princely houses.  When he reached Güstrow, he chose Louise because of her beauty, and his choice was wholeheartedly accepted as suitable from both the Danish royal house as well as from her family.  He reportedly also expected her to accept any potential adultery from his side without protests.

Crown Princess
On 5 December 1695, Louise married Crown Prince Frederik in Güstrow followed by their formal entry in to Copenhagen.  Initially, the marriage was described as happy; Louise reciprocated Frederick's attraction, and the French ambassador noted: "The crown princess loves her spouse intensely, and he lives with her in complete bliss".  Their children who reached maturity were King Christian VI of Denmark and Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark.

Queen
At the death of Christian V on 25 August 1699, the couple became King and Queen of Denmark-Norway. They were crowned on 15 April 1700 in the Chapel of Frederiksborg Palace. In parallel, Frederick's infatuation with Louise had passed, and he involved himself in a number of public affairs, notably with Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg (1699-1704), Charlotte Helene von Schindel (1704-11) and Anna Sophie Reventlow (1712–21). Frederick even entered two morganatic marriages; in 1703, he committed bigamy with his mistress Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg, and in 1712 with Anna Sophie Reventlow.   The day after Queen Louise's funeral, Frederick IV married Anna Sophie Reventlow again, and less than two months later he had her crowned.
Unlike Frederick IV, she never gained popularity with the population.  Louise figured in her role as queen at official ceremonies, but was otherwise ignored at court, and her isolated and quiet life has made her less known in history.     The official mistresses and wives by bigamy of the king were given their own titles, residences and courts, and their houses were frequented by the king and thereby by the nobility, while Queen Louise was ignored and deprived of her role as the female center in court life which her rank would otherwise have entitled her.   Her social isolation became particularly severe after the king's second bigamy with Anna Sophie Reventlow in 1712, and during her last nine years her life was described as a shadow, while she only appeared at the king's side in official ceremonies where the presence of the queen was demanded by etiquette.
Louise suffered because of her husband's infidelity.  It is mentioned that she caused embarrassing scenes at court during Frederick's affairs and that she had a bad temperament.  Her jealousy attracted great attention, and it was said that Frederick could not enter her rooms without Louise beginning to "cry, raise and walk about like a furie", which caused him to leave in anger, after which she "walked about for three or four hours, turning her hands and crying copiously."Queen Louise was strongly influenced by Pietism, and she sought solace in religion.   Her main interest was reading religious books.   Her collection of 400 books, which was donated to the royal library after her death, was mainly composed of ascetic religious literature in German.   After her death, her interest in religion was praised by the clergy, who compared her with the legendary Queen Esther and referred to her as a saint.  Louise was close to her son Christian, who was deeply influenced by her religious devotion and swore to avenge the sorrow his father's second bigamy with Anna Sophie Reventlow caused his mother on Reventlow, a promise he did keep after the death of his father.Very little is known about Louise, her interests and personality, because of her reclusive lifestyle, other than her jealousy over her husband's adultery and her religious devotions.  She did own a couple of estates as part of her dower as queen, notably Hørsholm, but does not appear to have taken any interest in them.
She died in Copenhagen and was buried in the Roskilde Cathedral.

Passage 10:
Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark
Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark and Norway (6 October 1706 – 28 October 1782) was a Danish princess, daughter of King Frederick IV of Denmark and Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.

Life
Charlotte Amalie never married. In 1725, she was placed on the list of 99 princesses regarded as suitable for marriage with Louis XV of France (which would require that she convert to Catholicism), but she was removed from the list because Denmark-Norway was an arch enemy toward Sweden, the traditional ally of France, and that such a marriage could potentially disturb the French-Swedish alliance.    In the early 1730s, her brother the king tried to arrange a marriage between her and Frederick, Prince of Wales, but the negotiations did not succeed and she remained unmarried.
As was the custom for unmarried princesses, she lived with her mother until her mother's death, and then with her stepmother. In contrast to her brother and sister-in-law, she had a good relationship with her stepmother, Anna Sophie Reventlow.  Charlotte Amalie tried to prevent the worst hostility toward her stepmother at court. She was separated from Anna Sophie when her brother succeeded to the throne in 1730. After this, she lived at the royal court in winters, and at Charlottenlund Palace in summer with her own court.
Charlotte Amalie was described by her contemporaries as a lovable character with the ability to keep the peace with most: she had a good relationship with her father and stepmother, and still managed to have a good relationship also with her brother, who hated his own father and stepmother. She had no influence upon the affairs of state, and lived a peaceful life at court her entire life.
On 8 April 1771, she was ordered to leave court. She spent the rest of her life with her nephew's widow, the queen dowager Juliana Maria. This meant that she continued to spend much of her time at court, when the queen dowager attended it: Juliana Maria became de facto regent in 1772.  
As she preferred black wigs, she had ordered her staff to wear them, and her court became known as "The court of the black wigs". After 1778, she no longer showed herself to the public, as she had become senile.Charlotte Amalie is known as the benefactress of the writer Charlotte Baden, who was the niece of one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, Anna Susanne von der Osten. Baden was raised at her court, and Charlotte Amalie provided her with an education and an allowance. In her will from 1773, Charlotte Amalie created a foundation, Prinsesse C.A.s stiftelse, to finance the upbringing of poor girls of all classes.

Legacy
Charlottenlund Palace, where she spent her summers, was built and named after her in 1731–1733.
