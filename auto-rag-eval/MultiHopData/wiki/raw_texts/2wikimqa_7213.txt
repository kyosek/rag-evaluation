Passage 1:
Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers
Major General Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers (c. 1628 – 14 September 1694) was an English nobleman and soldier.
He was the first son of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers by his wife Catherine, daughter of William Parker, 13th Baron Morley. His father was closely involved in the English Civil War on the Royalist side from 1641. Consequently, he lost his castles at Halton and Rocksavage and their contents were confiscated.
About 1647, he married firstly Elizabeth (b. 1627), illegitimate daughter of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland by his mistress Martha Jeanes. Their children included: Thomas, who married Charlotte, daughter of Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby; Richard, who succeeded as 4th Earl Rivers; Elizabeth; and Annabella. They also had other children who died young.He was widely believed to be a Roman Catholic, and during the Popish Plot he was denounced by informers, but the evidence was so flimsy that no charges were ever brought against him.
About 1684, he married secondly Arabella, daughter of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey. They had no issue.He died at his house in Great Queen Street in the Parish of St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex. A memorial to him by William Stanton was installed in St Michaels Church, Macclesfield.Documented evidence exists in the form of a pamphlet which details a murder by a Thomas Savage of St Giles in the Fields. It is likely the Thomas in question is the son of the 3rd Earl Rivers, or a family relation.
Passage 2:
Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey
Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey PC FRS (8 November 1630 – 8 May 1701), styled Lord Willoughby de Eresby from 1642 to 1666, was an English nobleman.
He was the son of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey and Martha Cokayne. He travelled on the Continent, in France and Italy from 1647 to 1652, attending the University of Padua in 1651. In 1654, he married Mary Massingberd, who died in the late 1650s, after bearing him one daughter:
Lady Arabella Bertie (d. 28 February 1716), married Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers.Before 1660, he married again to Elizabeth Wharton (d. 1669), daughter of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton, by whom he had five children:
Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven (1660–1723)
Rt. Hon. Peregrine Bertie (c. 1663–1711)
Hon. Philip Bertie (c. 1664–1728), married Elizabeth Brabazon, daughter of William Brabazon, 3rd Earl of Meath, without issue
Hon. Norris Bertie (c. 1666 – 27 August 1691)
Hon. Albemarle Bertie (c. 1668–1742)He contested Boston in 1661 and was returned to the Cavalier Parliament, in which he sat until he succeeded his father as Earl of Lindsey and Lord Great Chamberlain in 1666. In about 1670, he married a third time, to Lady Elizabeth Pope, daughter of Thomas Pope, 2nd Earl of Downe and widow of Sir Francis Lee, 4th Baronet. By her he had two children:
Hon. Charles Bertie (c. 1683–1727)
Lady Elizabeth Bertie, died unmarriedLindsey had inherited an electoral interest at Stamford, on which his brother Peregrine had been returned since 1665. In a 1677 by-election, Lindsey treated the voters lavishly and secured the election of his candidate against that of the 4th Earl of Exeter, heretofore the predominant interest in the borough. For a brief period, both Peregrine and their younger brother Charles Bertie sat for the borough, but the Exclusion crisis in 1679 temporarily destroyed Lindsey's influence and both were turned out. Lindsey's brothers regained both seats at the 1685 election, but in 1689, he compromised with the 5th Earl of Exeter and each chose one member, Lindsey's brother Charles holding the seat until 1711. In 1694, he put in his younger son Philip at a by-election alongside Charles, but the Exeter interest put up a candidate again in 1698 and Philip did not stand.
Passage 3:
Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey
Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey KG (16 December 1582 – 24 October 1642), previously (from 1601 to 1626) 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby was an English peer, soldier and courtier.

Early life
Robert Bertie was the son of Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby (b. 12 October 1555 – d. 25 June 1601) and Mary de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. Queen Elizabeth I was his godmother, and two of her favourite earls (Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex), whose Christian name he bore, were his godfathers.
He had been part of Essex's expedition to Cádiz, and had afterwards served in the Netherlands, under Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange. He was even given temporary command of English forces during the Siege of Rheinberg in the summer of 1601. The long Continental wars throughout the peaceful reign of King James I had been treated by the English nobility as schools of arms, as a few campaigns were considered a graceful finish to a gentleman's education.He succeeded his father as Baron Willoughby de Eresby in 1601. He was later created Earl of Lindsey on 22 November 1626 and took his title from the northern of the three parts of Lincolnshire, the old Kingdom of Lindsey.

The entrepreneur
The Lindsey Level in The Fens, between the River Glen and The Haven, at Boston, Lincolnshire, was named after the first Earl Lindsey as he was the principal adventurer in its drainage. The drainage work was declared complete in 1638 but the project was neglected with the onset of the Civil War so that the land fell back into its old state. When it was drained again, more than a hundred years later, it was called the Black Sluice Level. There is more information under the article Twenty, Lincolnshire.

The English Civil War
As soon as Lord Lindsey had begun to fear that the disputes between the King, Charles I and Parliament must end in war, he had begun to exercise and train his tenantry in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, of whom he had formed a regiment of infantry.

First Siege of Hull
Lord Lindsey accompanied the King in April 1642 as part of a party who tried to negotiate a handover of the magazine at Hull for the King's military use. This handover was turned down by the pro-Parliamentary governor, Sir John Hotham, who expelled the party, causing it to withdraw with the King to York. Early in July, the King returned from York with a force of 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, intent on besieging the city, now garrisoned by reinforcing Parliamentary troops commanded by Sir John Meldrum, returning to York while leaving Lord Lindsey in command through the siege.  Meldrum ordered some effective sorties out of the city, the last of which, on 27 July, blew up the arsenal Lindsey's troops had set up at Anlaby, west of Hull. Lindsey's force, whose cavalry were unsupported by the infantry who had withdrawn to Beverley, gave up the siege after this loss of their munitions and retreated back to York, lifting the siege.

Battle of Edgehill
As Lord Lindsey was a most experienced soldier of 59 years of age at the start of the English Civil War, King Charles I had appointed him General-in-chief of the Royalists for the Battle of Edgehill. However, the King had imprudently exempted the cavalry from Lindsey's command, its general, the King's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine, taking orders only from the King. Rupert was only 22 years old, and although an experienced soldier who had fought in the Thirty Years' War, he had not yet learnt that cavalry should also be used in support of infantry and not just against the enemy's cavalry.
With Lindsey was his son Montagu Bertie, Lord Willoughby who had seen some service against the Spaniards in the Netherlands, and after his return had been made a captain in the Lifeguards, and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. Anthony van Dyck has left portraits of the father and the son; the one a bald-headed, alert, precise-looking old warrior, with the cuirass and gauntlets of earlier warfare; the other, the very model of a cavalier, tall, easy, and graceful, with a gentle reflective face, and wearing the long lovelocks and deep-point lace collar and cuffs characteristic of Queen Henrietta's Court.
At eight o'clock, on the morning of 23 October 1642 King Charles was riding along the ridge of Edge Hill, and looking down into the Vale of the Red Horse, a fair meadow land, here and there broken by hedges and copses. His troops were mustering around him, and in the valley he could see with his telescope the various Parliamentary regiments, as they poured out of the town of Kineton, and took up their positions in three lines. "I never saw the rebels in a body before," he said, as he gazed sadly at the subjects arrayed against him. "I shall give them battle. God, and the prayers of good men to Him, assist the justice of my cause." The whole of his forces were not assembled till two o'clock in the afternoon, for the gentlemen who had become officers found it no easy matter to call their farmers and retainers together, and marshal them into any sort of order.
Lord Lindsey, who was an old comrade of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, who was by then the commander of the Parliamentarian forces, knew that he would follow the tactics they had both together studied in Holland, little thinking that one day they should be arrayed one against the other in their own native England. He had a high opinion of Essex's generalship, and insisted that the situation of the Royal army required the utmost caution. Rupert, on the other hand, had seen the swift fiery charges of the fierce troopers of the Thirty Years' War, and was backed up by Patrick Ruthven, Lord Ruthven, one of the many Scots who had won honour under King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. A sudden charge of the Royal horse would, Rupert argued, sweep the Roundheads from the field, and the foot would have nothing to do but to follow up the victory. The King, sad enough at having to fight at all with his subjects, and never having seen a battle, seemed entirely bewildered between the ardent words of his spirited nephew and the grave replies of the well-seasoned old Earl. Eventually the King, willing at least not to irritate Rupert, desired that Ruthven should array the troops in the Swedish fashion.
It was a greater affront to the General-in-chief than the king was likely to understand, but it could not shake the old soldier's loyalty. He gravely resigned the empty title of General, which only made confusion worse confounded, and rode away to act as colonel of his own Lincolnshire regiment, pitying his master's perplexity, and resolved that no private pique should hinder him from doing his duty. His regiment was of foot soldiers, and was just opposite to the standard of the Earl of Essex.
In the afternoon the Royal forces marched down the hill. Prince Rupert's charge was fully successful. No one even waited to cross swords with his troopers, but all the Roundhead horse galloped headlong off the field, hotly pursued by the Royalists. However, the main body of the army stood firm, and for some time the battle was nearly equal, until a large troop of Parliamentary cavalry who had been kept in reserve, wheeled round and fell upon the Royal forces just when their scanty supply of ammunition was exhausted. Step by step, however, they retreated bravely, and Rupert, who had returned from his charge, sought in vain to collect his scattered troopers, so as to fall again on the Roundheads. Some were plundering, some chasing the Roundheads, and none could be got together.

Death
Lord Lindsey was shot through the thigh bone, and fell. He was instantly surrounded by Roundhead cavalry; but his son, Lord Willoughby, seeing his danger, flung himself alone among them, forced his way forward, and raised his father in his arm, unheeding his own safety. The throng of Roundheads around called to him to surrender, and, hastily giving up his sword, he carried the Earl into the nearest shed, and laid him on a heap of straw, vainly striving to staunch the blood under watch of a Roundhead guard.
It was a bitterly cold night, and the frosty wind came howling through the darkness. Lord Lindsey himself murmured, "If it please God I should survive, I never will fight in the same field with boys again!"–no doubt deeming that young Rupert had wrought all the mischief. His thoughts were all on the cause, his son's all on him. It proved impossible to stop his wounds bleeding and gradually the old man's strength ebbed away.
Toward midnight the Earl's old comrade Essex had news of his condition, and sent some officers to enquire for him, and promise speedy surgical attendance. Lindsey was still full of spirit, and spoke to them so strongly of their broken faith, and of the sin of disloyalty and rebellion, that they slunk away one by one out of the hut, and dissuaded Essex from coming himself to see his old friend, as he had intended. The surgeon, however, arrived, but too late, Lindsey was already so much exhausted by cold and loss of blood, that he died early in the morning of 24 October 1642, as he was being carried through the gates of Warwick Castle where other Royalist prisoners were being kept. His son, despite King Charles' best efforts to obtain his exchange, remained a prisoner of the Parliamentary side for about a year. Lindsey is buried in St Michael and All Angels Church, Edenham, Lincolnshire.Lord Lindsey should not be confused with Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford, who also fought for the King at the Battle of Edgehill.

Marriage and issue
In 1605, Lindsey married Elizabeth Montagu (d. 30 November 1654, sister of Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton). They had thirteen children:

Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey (1608–1666)

Notes
Passage 4:
Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey
Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey, KG, PC (1608 – 25 July 1666), was an English soldier, courtier, and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1624 and 1626. He was created Baron Willoughby de Eresby by writ of acceleration in 1640 and inherited the peerage of Earl of Lindsey in 1642. He fought in the Royalist army in the English Civil War.

Early life
Bertie was born in Grimsthorpe Castle, Grimsthorpe, the eldest son of Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey, and his wife Elizabeth Montagu, daughter of Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton. After a brief term at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1623, Bertie then served as Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire in 1624 and Stamford from 1625 to 1626, when, upon his father's elevation to an earldom, he assumed the style of Lord Willoughby de Eresby.
At some point during his early life, he was also Captain of a cavalry troop in the Low Countries. He rose in favour with King Charles I and was appointed a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, High Steward of Boston, and Steward, Warden and Chief Ranger of Waltham Forest in 1634.In 1639, Willoughby raised The King's Life Guard of Foot, composed of four companies, for service in the First Bishops' War and was given a Captaincy in the regiment. The following year, he was appointed High Steward of the Honour of Bolingbroke and the Manor of Sutton. When the Long Parliament was convened on 3 November 1640, he was summoned to the House of Lords by a writ of acceleration as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. In October 1641, Lord Willoughby and four companions, including Endymion Porter, visited Scotland. Their sight-seeing was recorded in an anonymous poem, A Scottish Journie.

English Civil War
Both Lord Willoughby and his father supported the King and raised a regiment of cavalry in Lincolnshire on his behalf. Lord Willoughby commanded the Life Guards at Edgehill, where his father was mortally wounded by a shot through the thigh. Willoughby surrendered to the Parliamentarians in order to attend his father, whom he now succeeded as Earl of Lindsey and Lord Great Chamberlain. He was imprisoned in Warwick Castle, where he wrote a defiant declaration and justification of his loyalty to the King. He was not released until a prisoner exchange in July 1643, whereupon he rejoined the King at Oxford and was appointed a Privy Counsellor in December. As colonel of the King's Life Guards of Foot and subsequently lieutenant-general of the Life Guards "and all the foot", he fought at the First Battle of Newbury, Cropredy Bridge, Lostwithiel, Second Battle of Newbury, and was wounded at Naseby. In addition to his military services for the King, Lindsey frequently acted as a commissioner to treat with Parliament and persistently urged reconciliation. The King additionally honored Lindsey with the post of Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1643 until 1649, and Steward, Keeper and Ranger of Woodstock in 1644.Lindsey was present at the surrender of Oxford in June 1646, attended the King in 1647, and finally served as a commissioner for the Treaty of Newport in 1648. He continued to attend the King during his trial and accompanied the King's body to its burial at Windsor. Lindsey paid heavily for his allegiance, compounding for his estates in December 1646 at £4360 (later reduced to £2100), a sum he did not pay off until 1651.

Commonwealth and Restoration
After the execution of the King, Lindsey retired into private life, and although his movements were carefully monitored by the Council of State, particularly during the Penruddock uprising and Booth's rebellion, he apparently took no part in the Royalist movement.After the Restoration, Lindsey was re-appointed to the Privy Council, admitted as Lord Great Chamberlain, and appointed Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. He was made a Knight of the Garter on 1 April 1661 and officiated as Lord Great Chamberlain at the coronation of Charles II on 23 April 1661. In 1662, the office of Earl Marshal was placed in commission and he was named one of the commissioners. Lindsey died in 1666 at Campden House, Kensington, the home of his son-in-law, and was buried at Grimsthorpe.

At the 1708 British general election, he stood down at Lincolnshire to make way for his nephew, Lord Willoughby de Eresby and was returned instead for Cockermouth on the interest of his uncle, the 1st Earl of Wharton. He was probably the candidate put up by the Wharton interest at Appleby at the 1710 British general election, who withdrew before the poll expressing a desire to sit no longer in Parliament.Bertie stood for Lincolnshire again at a by-election in 1721, but was defeated. At the 1734 British general election, he was returned for Boston by his nephew, now the 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, but stood down again at the 1741 British general election and died the following year.

At the time of his death he was engaged to Lady Anna Waldegrave, daughter of James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave, and Maria Walpole, the illegitimate granddaughter of Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister. Lady Waldegrave, after her husband's death, married in secret Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, a younger brother of King George III, a marriage which outraged the King and led to the passing of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. After his death, his fiancée married Lord Hugh Seymour. He was buried on 22 July 1779 in Edenham. On his death, the Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlainship and the Barony Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between his two sisters, all other titles of his passed to his uncle.

He became 3rd Major of the regiment 12 March 1789 and 2nd Major on 8 August 1792.In 1793, he was promoted major-general, and was appointed colonel of the newly formed 81st Regiment of Foot on 19 September with instructions to recruit volunteers for it. In 1794, he obtained a colonelcy of an existing regiment, the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, instead. Bertie was promoted lieutenant-general in 1798 and general in 1803. In 1804, the Duke of York recommended him for the colonelcy of the 77th Regiment of Foot, then part of the Indian establishment, noting that "the difference of emolument is of great consequence" to Bertie. In 1808, he became commander of the 89th Regiment of Foot after John Whitelocke was cashiered and dismissed from the service.Bertie retired from active service in 1809 upon inheriting the title of Earl of Lindsey from his third cousin on 8 February 1809.

He held the seat until succeeding to his peerage in 1809, but demonstrated little activity in Parliament. Lindsey inherited the Irish title of Viscount Cullen by special remainder in 1810, but never claimed it nor was acknowledged in the title.
