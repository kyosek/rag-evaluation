Gilbert Talbot, 3rd Baron Talbot (c. 1332–1387) was an English nobleman and soldier.

Family
Talbot was the son and heir of Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot and his wife Elizabeth de Comyn. The Talbot family had been locally prominent in Herefordshire since the reign of Henry II of England, and had blood connections to both the Welsh and Scottish nobility. His father died in 1356, resulting in his succession as the third Baron Talbot.

Military career
Talbot served in several English military campaigns. He fought in the Hundred Years War under the Black Prince, and was with the royal fleet under Admiral Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk. During the Peasants' Revolt, he was one of the commissioners tasked with raising forces to fight the rebels. He served under the Earl of Cambridge in Portugal and Spain in 1381–1382, and was present at the capture of Higuera la Real. During this Iberian service, he was chosen as the ambassador of the English forces to the king of Portugal to demand their wages.

Death and legacy
Talbot died on 24 April 1387 and was succeeded by his son Richard. He seems to have been a spendthrift, and left significant debts at his death. A year earlier, he had been pardoned for outlawry after failing to answer the Earl of Arundel concerning a debt of £3000. The economic problems he left behind were still affecting the Talbot family in the time of his grandson, the fifth baron.
Passage 4:
Lawrie McKinna
Lawrie McKinna (born 8 July 1961) is a Scottish-Australian former football player, coach, and former Mayor of Gosford City Council.

Lawrie unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the September 2013 Federal election for the seat of Robertson. His campaign was backed by John Singleton to the tune of $380,000. While receiving 8.7% of the vote, Singleton and McKinna controversially decided the outcome of the seat by directing preference votes to the conservative Liberal Party candidate Ms Lucy Wicks. Ms Wicks formally thanked Lawrie & his backer John Singleton in her maiden speech in parliament.

Early life
McKinna was born in Galston in southwest Scotland.

Playing career

In May 2006 he signed a new five-year contract with the Mariners.McKinna was popular in the community for his insistence that all the players at the club engaged in community activities. This became a hallmark of his tenure at the fledgling club.
In the 2006/2007 season, McKinna gave an interview during which his team were struggling for on field success. Notably saying how it was frustrating for him when the press report losses in matches but don't mention the long-term injury's to the sides key players like Nik Mrdja, Andre Gumprecht and Noel Spencer.

Passage 5:
Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland
Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland (c. 1456 – 6 February 1499) was an English peer. He was the grandfather of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland.

Origins
He was born in about 1456, the only child of John Neville, Baron Neville (younger brother of Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland) by his wife Anne Holland, daughter of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter (1395-1447).

Career
Neville's father was slain fighting for the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, and attainted on 4 November of that year. On 6 October 1472 Ralph Neville obtained the reversal of his father's attainder and the restoration of the greater part of his estates, and thereby became Lord Neville (1459 creation).On 18 April 1475 Neville was created a Knight of the Bath together with the sons of King Edward IV. He was a justice of the peace in Durham. For his 'good services against the rebels', on 23 March 1484 King Richard III granted Neville manors in Somerset and Berkshire and the reversion of lands which had formerly belonged to Margaret, Countess of Richmond. In September 1484 he was a commissioner to keep the truce with Scotland. On 3 November 1484 his uncle, Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, died, and Neville succeeded as 3rd Earl of Westmorland and Lord Neville (1295 creation).After the Yorkist defeat at Bosworth, Westmorland entered into bonds to the new king, Henry VII, of £400 and 400 marks, and on 5 December 1485, he gave custody (and the approval of the marriage of his eldest son and heir), Ralph Neville (d.1498), to the King.Westmorland held a command in the army sent into Scotland in 1497 after James IV supported the pretensions to the crown of Perkin Warbeck.

Death
Westmorland's eldest son died in 1498. Westmorland died at Hornby Castle, Yorkshire, the seat of his son-in-law, Sir William Conyers, on 6 February 1499, allegedly of grief for his son's death, and was buried in the parish church there. His grandson, Ralph Neville, succeeded to the earldom as 4th Earl of Westmorland.

Marriage and issue
Before 20 February 1473, Neville married Isabel Booth, the daughter of Sir Roger Booth, esquire (1396–1467) and Catherine Hatton, and the niece of Lawrence Booth, Archbishop of York, by whom he had a son and a daughter:
Ralph Neville, Lord Neville (d. 1498). As noted above, on 5 December 1485, his father had granted his custody (and the approval of the marriage of his eldest son) to the King. Accordingly, Lord Neville married firstly, in the presence of King Henry VII and his Queen, Elizabeth of York, Mary Paston (born 19 January 1470), the eldest daughter of Sir William Paston (b. 1436 – died before 7 September 1496) by Lady Anne Beaufort, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. She died of measles at court, about Christmas 1489. There were no issue of the marriage.
Lady Anne Neville, who married firstly, William Conyers, 1st Baron Conyers, and secondly, Anthony Saltmarsh (1473–1550) of Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire.Lord Neville married secondly, again in the royal presence, Edith Sandys (d. 22 August 1529), sister of William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys, by whom he had three children:

Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland
a son who died young
Cecilia Neville, who married John Weston, son of John Weston Jr. and Virginia Alice Edshaw, and was the mother of Dr Robert Weston, Lord Chancellor of IrelandAfter Lord Neville's death in 1498, his widow Edith married Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy, who was beheaded on Tower Hill on 30 June 1537.

Footnotes
Passage 6:
Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet
Sir Archibald Acheson of Glencairn, Lord Glencairn, 1st Baronet (1583 – 9 September 1634), was a Scottish jurist.

Biography
Acheson was the son of Captain Patrick Acheson and Martha Drummond.On 31 March 1620, "Archibald Acheson, a Scotchman", was knighted at Theobalds by King James I, and in 1621 he was appointed Master in Chancery of Ireland. Sometime before 25 October 1626 he was appointed a Lord of Session of Scotland as 'Lord Glencairn'. On 21 October 1627, he was appointed by King Charles I as Royal Secretary of State of Scotland. On 1 January 1628, he was made a Baronet of Nova Scotia.Lord Glencairn died at Letterkenny, County Donegal, in the west of Ulster in September 1634.

Ireland
In 1610, at the start of the Plantation of Ulster, numerous land grants were made in the precinct of Fewes in County Armagh. One was of 2,000 acres to Sir James Douglas, Knt., of Spott, Haddingtonshire, subsequently sold the next year to Henry Acheson, who afterwards sold it to Sir Archibald Acheson. A further 1,000 acres originally granted to Henry was also sold on to Sir Archibald Acheson in 1628. Acheson does not ever appear to have resided in Ireland, however, and his position in the Court of Chancery there appears titular; his judicial duties were all in Scotland. He nevertheless became a "denizen" of Ireland on 12 February 1618, presumably in order to qualify for the lands he was receiving from his brother, Henry Acheson of Dromlech, County Armagh. Certainly Sir Archibald's second son, George, resided in Ireland.

Family
Acheson wed Agnes Vernor at some point before 1610, fathering an eldest son, Sir Patrick Acheson, 2nd Baronet (c.1611-1638). Sir John Scot (1754) states that this son died after his first year of marriage, to an English heiress, without issue.
After his first wife died, Sir Archibald remarried in 1622, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Hamilton and Johanna Everard, by whom he had a son, George (1629–1685).By his first wife he had a daughter, Jean, who married Sir Lewis Lauder of Over Gogar & Alderston, Knt., (c1599-c1640), Sheriff-Principal of Edinburgh and son of Sir Alexander Lauder of Haltoun, Knt. They had at least three known children. Jean was still living on 3 April 1663 as "relict of Sir Lewes Lauder of Over Gogar".Lord Glencairn may have had another daughter by one of his marriages, Isabella Acheson of Gosford, who married Hector Og Maclean (1583–1623). Sources list her as the daughter of "Sir Archibald Acheson", but because of her age, she may have been the daughter of Captain Patrick Acheson or one of his siblings. If she was the same age as Hector Og Maclean, she would have been born in 1583 and would have had her first child around 1600 at age 17. If she was the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson she would be born no earlier than 1610 the year Archibald married. This would make her at least 20 years younger than Hector Og Maclean, and would make her the same age as her own children. This is the error in the standard genealogy.His eldest son Patrick succeeded him to the baronetcy but having died without issue several years after his father, whereupon the title passed to his half-brother Sir George Acheson, 3rd Baronet, who relocated to Ireland and in 1657 was High Sheriff of Counties Armagh and Tyrone.

He became vice-admiral of Ulster, also received the Order of the Dannebrog, and the Order of the White Eagle (Russian Empire). Since there are two United Kingdom peerages (e.g. Baron Worlingham) subsumed in that Irish Earldom, he was entitled to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was Lord Lieutenant of Armagh from 1883 to 1920, and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household of Queen Alexandra from 1901.He was Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Fusiliers from 1899, and Vice-Admiral of Ulster.

Passage 10:
Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford
Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford,  (1 August 1776 – 27 March 1849), styled The Honourable Archibald Acheson from 1790 to 1806 and Lord Acheson from 1806 to 1807, was a British politician who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada and Governor General of British North America in the 19th century.

Early life
Acheson was born on 1 August 1776 at Markethill, County Armagh, Ireland.  Gosford was the son of Arthur Acheson, 1st Earl of Gosford, and his wife Millicent (née Pole). He succeeded his father to his titles and estates in 1807.

Career
Acheson sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Armagh from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom. Subsequently, he was a Member of the British House of Commons representing Armagh to 1807, when he succeeded to his father's Irish titles as Earl of Gosford. He entered the British House of Lords in 1811 upon being elected an Irish Representative Peer.In 1831 he was appointed the first Lord Lieutenant of Armagh for life, having previously been a Governor of Armagh since 1805. The new position incorporated the post of Custos Rotulorum of County Armagh which he also already held. He was created Baron Worlingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1835 and thus became a member of the UK House of Lords in his own right. He commissioned Thomas Hopper (1776–1856) to design a new house, Gosford Castle on his Gosford estate. The house would not be completed until after his death.
In 1835, he became Governor General of British North America (also Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada), and commissioner in the Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty's Subjects of Lower Canada. He was instructed to appease the reformists, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, without giving them any real power. Gosford attempted to distance himself from his predecessor, Lord Aylmer, who had exacerbated the hostility of French-Canadians to the British administration. Gosford officially established the Diocese of Montreal in 1836, though it had been unofficially created a few years before. In August of that year Gosford dissolved the Legislative Assembly when they refused to pass his budget.In November, Lord Gosford learned of the planned Lower Canada Rebellion and had many of Papineau's followers arrested, although Papineau himself escaped to the United States. The next month, he issued a reward for the capture of Papineau, and declared martial law in Lower Canada.
Lord Gosford resigned in November 1837 and returned to Britain the next year. His eventual successor, Lord Durham, implemented the Act of Union 1840, uniting Lower and Upper Canada, which Lord Gosford had unsuccessfully argued against.

Personal life
He married Mary Sparrow, the daughter and heiress of Robert Sparrow of Worlingham Hall, Suffolk, with whom he had a son and four daughters.
Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford (20 August 1806 – 15 June 1864), he succeeded his father upon his death.
Lady Mary Acheson (27 June 1809 – 13 March 1850). On 9 July 1835 she married James Hewitt, 4th Viscount Lifford. They had four sons, and four daughters.
Lady Millicent French Acheson (circa 1812 – 29 August 1887). She married Henry Bence Jones on 28 May 1842. They had three sons, and four daughters. The youngest son, Archibald, married a daughter of Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow.Lord Gosford died in 1849.

Legacy
It is believed the city of Gosford in New South Wales, Australia was named after him, the Governor of New South Wales having served with him in Canada.
