Passage 1:
Power Le Poer Trench
Power Le Poer Trench (1770–1839) was an Anglican clergyman who served in the Church of Ireland as firstly Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, then Bishop of Elphin and finally Archbishop of Tuam.

Life
He was the second surviving son of William Trench, 1st Earl of Clancarty, among his nine brothers and nine sisters was his elder brother Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty, and Lady Emily La Touche was a younger sister. Born in Sackville Street, Dublin, on 10 June 1770, he was first educated at a preparatory school at Putney, whence he went for a short time to Harrow, and afterwards at the academy of Mr. Ralph at Castlebar, in the immediate neighbourhood of his home. Trench matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 July 1787, where his tutor was Matthew Young, afterwards bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, and graduated B.A. on 13 July 1791. Later in the same year (27 November) Trench was ordained deacon, and, having received priest's orders on 24 June 1792, he was in the same month inducted into the benefice of Creagh, in which his father's residence and the great fair town of Ballinasloe were situated. In the following year (5 November 1793) he was presented to the benefice of Rawdenstown, County Meath. He obtained a faculty to hold the two cures together, and combined with their clerical duties the business of agent on his father's Galway estate. Trench was a man of great bodily strength and a fine horseman, and he retained a fondness for field sports to the end of his days. During the Irish rebellion of 1798 he acted as a captain in the local yeomanry raised by his father to resist the French invading army under Humbert.
In 1802 Trench was appointed to the see of Waterford, in succession to Richard Marlay, and was consecrated on 21 November 1802. In 1810 he was translated to the bishopric of Elpin, and, on the death of Archbishop Beresford, was on 4 October 1819 advanced to the archepiscopal see of Tuam. In May 1834, on the death of James Verschoyle, the united sees of Killala and Achonry were, under the provisions of the Irish Church Temporalities Act, added to the charge of Trench. By the same act, the archdiocese of Tuam was reduced, on Trench's death, to an ordinary bishopric.
In the history of the Irish church Trench chiefly deserves to be remembered for his activity in promoting the remarkable evangelical movement in the west of Ireland which was known in Connaught as the Second Reformation, and which, chiefly through the agency of the Irish Society, made a vigorous effort to win converts to Protestantism. From 1818 to his death Trench was president of the Irish Society; and it is evidence of his large-heartedness that the religious controversies in which his leadership of this movement involved no wise impaired the remarkable personal popularity which he enjoyed among his Roman Catholic neighbours. Holding strong views as to the paramount importance of the 'open bible,' Trench was a strenuous opponent of the mixed system of national education founded by Mr. Stanley (Lord Derby), and was one of the founders of the Church Education Society. Trench was a man of strong and masterful character, and during the twenty years of his archiepiscopate was one of the foremost figures in the Ireland of his day.
He died on 26 March 1839. Trench married, on 29 January 1795, his cousin Anne, daughter of Walter Taylor of Castle Taylor, co. Galway. By her, he had two sons, William and Power, and six daughters. Elizabeth, his third daughter, married Captain Henry Gascoyne in 1830. Another daughter Anne married James O'Hara, MP for Galway in 1823.

As a result, he did all in his power to dissolve the marriage.  When this was unsuccessful he stopped his son's allowance, and resorted to selling lands in order to diminish his heir's eventual income, but his daughter-in-law's income from the stage was too great for these expedients to have much impact.

Passage 9:
Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty
William Francis Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty, 7th Marquess of Heusden (18 September 1911 – 18 May 1995) was a prominent ufologist.  He was an Irish peer, as well as a nobleman in the Dutch nobility.

Biography
He was the fifth son of William Frederick Le Poer Trench, 5th Earl of Clancarty by Mary Gwatkin Ellis. He had four older half-brothers born to the 5th Earl's first wife, Isabel Maud Penrice Bilton, the actress known as Belle Bilton, who died of cancer in 1906. Brinsley was educated at the Pangbourne Nautical College.
From 1956 to 1959 Clancarty edited the Flying Saucer Review and founded the International Unidentified Object Observer Corps. He also found employment selling advertising space for a gardening magazine housed opposite Waterloo station.
In 1967, he founded Contact International and served as its first president. He also served as vice-president of the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). Clancarty was an honorary life member of the now defunct Ancient Astronauts Society which supported the ideas put forward by Erich von Däniken in his 1968 book Chariots of the Gods?.
In 1975 he succeeded to the earldom on the death of his half-brother, Grenville Sydney Rocheforte, 7th Earl of Clancarty, giving him a seat in the British Parliament. He used his new position to found a UFO Study Group at the House of Lords, introducing Flying Saucer Review to its library and pushing for the declassification of UFO data.
Four years later he organised a celebrated debate in the House of Lords on UFOs which attracted many speeches on both sides of the question. In one debate, Lord Strabolgi, for the Government, declared that there was nothing to convince him that any alien spacecraft had ever visited the Earth.

Private life
Clancarty first married, in 1940, Diana (1919–1999), daughter of Sir William Younger, Bt. This marriage was dissolved in 1947. He married secondly, in 1961, Mrs Wilma Belknap (née Vermilyea) (1915–1995) and that marriage was dissolved in 1969. His third marriage was in 1974, to Mrs Mildred Allewyn Spong (née Bensusan) (1895–1975). She died in 1975 but Clancarty remarried a fourth time, in 1976, to Mrs May Beasley (née Radonicich) (1904–2003).
He lived most of his life in South Kensington and died in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1995, leaving his extensive collection of papers to Contact International.
He was succeeded to the earldom by his nephew Nicholas Le Poer Trench (b. 1952).

Hollow Earth theory
In 1974, Trench published Secret of the Ages: UFOs from Inside the Earth, a book which theorised that the centre of the Earth was hollow, with entrances to its interior located at both the north and south polar areas. The interior, he suggested, consisted of large tunnel systems connecting a large cavern world. Trench also believed that the lost continent of Atlantis actually once existed and that these tunnels were probably constructed all over the world by the Atlanteans, for various purposes.
Trench believed that there was no actual North Pole, but instead a large area with a warm sea dipping gradually into the interior of the Earth. He said that humans were 'living on the deck of a ship, unaware of the life going on under our feet'. One argument he put forward for this theory was that whilst the Earth is spherical, it is flattened at the poles. Additionally, he questioned how all icebergs could be composed of frozen fresh water, if no rivers were flowing from the inside of the Earth to the outside. He had also suggested that a large proportion of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) emanated from the Earth's interior. These objects were likely to have been created by a group of much more technically advanced beings, similar to humans, but a group that likely possessed extrasensory abilities, as well as the ability to manipulate psychic phenomena. Another argument for the Hollow Earth theory was that everything he suggested, nebulae, comets and planets, are hollow and these conditions would certainly prove favourable for a hollow Earth.
Whilst Trench had in one of his earlier books disregarded the Hollow Earth theory, he admitted to at the time 'being educated along with millions of other people to believe that the Earth had a liquid molten core'.

Other claims
According to Trench in his book The Sky People, Adam and Eve, Noah and many of the other characters from the Bible originally lived on Mars. Trench believed that Adam and Eve were experimental creations of extraterrestrials. His claim was that the Biblical description of the Garden of Eden was inconsistent with what was on Earth and as Mars contained canals, that the Garden of Eden must have been located on Mars. He further claimed that the north polar ice cap melted on Mars, and this caused the descendants of Adam and Eve to move to Earth.Trench also claimed to know a former U.S. test pilot who said he was one of six persons present at a meeting between President Eisenhower and a group of aliens, which allegedly took place at Edwards Air Force Base on 4 April 1954. Clancarty reported that the test pilot told him "Five different alien craft landed at the base. Three were saucer-shaped and two were cigar shaped... the aliens looked something like humans, but not exactly."He claimed that he could trace his descent from 63,000 BC, when beings from other planets had landed on Earth in spaceships.
