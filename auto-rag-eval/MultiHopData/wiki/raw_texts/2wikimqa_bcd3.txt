Passage 1:
Marianne von Willemer
Marianne von Willemer (born 20 November 1784, probably in Linz; died 6 December 1860 in Frankfurt am Main; probably born as Marianne Pirngruber; also known as Marianne Jung) was an Austrian actress and dancer best known for her relationship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and her appearance in his poetry.

Biography
At the age of 14 she moved to Frankfurt am Main, where she became the third wife of Frankfurt banker Johann Jakob von Willemer. He introduced her to Goethe, who met Marianne in 1814 and 1815. Goethe immortalised her in the Buch Suleika of his late work West-östlicher Divan; she later revealed that several of its poems were authored by her.
Passage 2:
Mary Proctor
Mary Proctor  (1862 – 11 September 1957) was an American popularizer of astronomy. While not a professional astronomer, Proctor became well known for her books and articles written for the public – particularly her children's fiction.  Despite various claims as being an American, there is a passenger list of about 1924 where she gives nationality as British.

Early life
Mary Proctor was born in Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Mary and Richard Proctor. Proctor's mother died in 1879. Her father remarried in 1881 and her family immigrated to the United States settling in Saint Joseph, Missouri in 1882.Proctor's father was a British popularizer of astronomy, lecturer, and writer. As she grew up, Proctor often assisted her father in his work, looking after his library and correcting proofs of his books before they went to publication. She graduated from the London College of Preceptors in 1898.The crater Proctor on the Moon was named after her and Proctor on Mars was named after her father.)

Career
In 1881, Proctor assisted her father in founding and producing a journal called Knowledge. She wrote a series of articles on the topic of comparative mythology. After a well-received appearance at the World's Columbian Exposition 1893, she eventually developed a career as an astronomy lecturer. Her book-length debut, Stories of Starland (1898), was adopted by the New York City Board of Education. She worked as an astronomy teacher in private schools while attending Columbia University.

Works
Proctor authored many articles for newspapers, journals and published numerous popular books. Her articles and books were mostly aimed for young readers, which earned her the nickname "the children's astronomer." Her books were easy to read, accurate, informative and well illustrated. Known and respected by many professional astronomers, Proctor became an elected member of the British Astronomical Association in 1897 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1898.  On 11 February 1916, she was elected as a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Passage 3:
Lara Porzak
Lara Porzak (born April 14, 1967, in Rome, Italy) is an American fine art photographer, daughter of Pulitzer-prize nominated novelist, Marianne Wiggins.

About
Lara Porzak works predominantly with black & white film and is acclaimed for using labour-intensive, non-digital photographic methods, often utilizing vintage cameras and lenses from the late 1800s to create her photographs. According to The Los Angeles Times, "Her photojournalistic style combines with the romantic influences of European photographers from the 1930s and ‘40s to give her work a timeless quality with a strong sense of narrative."Porzak is "a real-deal fine art photographer" who has produced over 20 fine art photography shows and her work is part of the Getty museum's California Artist's Collection. The quality of her handmade photographs, using the gelatin silver process and tintypes has attracted many collectors throughout the world, as C Magazine so eloquently writes "If a picture is worth a thousand words, no doubt a Lara Porzak image is worth a great deal more." Her photographs have also appeared on many television shows & movies.Porzak started her own photography business in the late 1990s as a fine art wedding photographer with a photojournalistic style, and her talent for disappearing into her subjects soon elevated her to the top of her field; travelling the globe, capturing weddings with her artistic aesthetic. Porzak has photographed the weddings of (to only name a few, in alphabetical order): Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Kevin Costner, Ellen DeGeneres, Mariska Hargitay, Heidi Klum, Adam Sandler, Brooke Shields, Channing Tatum and Reese Witherspoon. When asked about her wedding photography in a magazine interview Porzak is quoted as saying, “my interest in photography isn’t just so people can remember what happened, but so they can remember how they felt.” Lured by the perfect light in which to make tintypes, she now lives in sunny Venice Beach, California.
Porzak is often quoted as saying 'the soul is not digital' and says with conviction "there is no separation between my work and my life."Her favorite color is whiskey.

Education
Lara Porzak attended Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School and received her degree from Dartmouth College. A self-proclaimed photography workshop junkie, Porzak has studied with Mary Ellen Mark, Graciela Iturbide and Christopher James amongst others.

Passage 4:
Alexandros Margaritis
Alexandros "Alex" Margaritis (Greek: Αλέξανδρος Μαργαρίτης; born 20 September 1984) is a Greek-German racing driver who is best known for competing in the German-based Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters touring car championship. Prior to that, his career had focused on formula single seater racing in Europe. Margaritis has dual nationality as a result of his place of birth and Greek parentage.

Karting and formula racing
Margaritis had his first experience of karting in 1996, and in 1997, he competed in the ICA Junior class, in which he secured the championship runner-up position. He spent the next two seasons competing in the International Junior class in Germany, finishing 4th overall in 1999. In the following year, Margaritis made his single seater formula debut in the Formula BMW ADAC championship. In 2001, he achieved three podium finishes and one pole position on the way to 6th in the championship standings.
After one season in German Formula Renault, in which he finished 7th overall, Margaritis made his Formula Three debut in the first season of the new Formula 3 Euro Series. He achieved one podium finish and two pole positions during the first year and retained a place in the series in 2004.

Touring cars
In 2005, Margaritis moved from formula racing to touring cars when an opportunity arose in one of Europe's most high-profile touring car championships. He was signed by Mücke Motorsport, which was making the same transition between disciplines.
In a 2004-specification AMG Mercedes C Klasse, Margaritis did not achieve any points finishes; his best finish was 9th place at Spa-Francorchamps. He then moved to Persson Motorsport as the third driver in its 2006 line-up alongside Mathias Lauda and Jean Alesi. He was classified 11th in the standings, with a total of 11 points, and achieved a best finish of 5th position in the season's first race. Persson retained his services in 2007 alongside Paul di Resta and Gary Paffett. He finished 10th in the overall drivers standings with 16 points, achieving two 4th places.
On 27 February 2008, Margaritis announced his intention to leave the DTM and seek a position in another championship or category, citing as a primary factor the handicap of competing in year-old cars against machinery of factory specification.

Grand Tourers
In 2008, Margaritis switched his focus to GT cars: He competed in the 24 Hours of Spa for Phoenix Racing. The Corvette C6.R failed to finish the race and was classified 37th.
After one season without racing in major series, Margaritis participated in the newly created FIA GT1 World Championship. He drove for Triple H Team Hegersport and Phoenix Racing. In spite of not participating in all events he finished 7th in the overall standings.
Margaritis switched to the ADAC GT Masters in 2011. He and his partner Dino Lunardi won the driver's championship in their BMW ALPINA B6 GT3. In 2012 Margaritis switched to Team Heico to share a car with Lance David Arnold. The pairing finished 18th in their Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3. 
Heico hired Magaritis for the 2011 and 2012 editions of the 24 Hours Nürburgring as well.
2013 saw Margaritis getting a part-time drive for H&R Spezialfedern GmbH & Co in the VLN.

Passage 6:
Sheila Atim
Sheila Atim  (; born c. 1991) is a Ugandan-British actress, singer, composer, and playwright. She made her professional acting debut in 2013 at Shakespeare's Globe in The Lightning Child, a musical written by her acting teacher Ché Walker.
Following critically acclaimed stage roles in the Donmar Warehouse's all-female Shakespeare Trilogy in 2016 among others, Atim won the 2018 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for her role as Marianne Laine in an original production of Girl from the North Country. She has composed songs for several productions and premiered her play Anguis at the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. She has also been cast in several television series, including the cancelled Game of Thrones successor series Bloodmoon, the BBC's The Pale Horse and Amazon's The Underground Railroad, directed by Barry Jenkins. In 2021, she starred in Netflix's successful sports drama Bruised, directed and produced by Halle Berry. In 2022, she won another Laurence Olivier Award, this time for Best Lead Actress, for her performance in the play Constellations.

Early life
Sheila Atim was born c. 1991 in Uganda and moved to the United Kingdom with her mother at the age of five months. She grew up in Rainham, London, and attended the Coopers' Company and Coborn School. She did some occasional modelling as a teenager after being recruited when she shaved the side of her head for a school prom. She appeared in a 2009 London Fashion Week event, All Walks beyond the Catwalk, organized by the British Fashion Council to showcase clothes for "real women". She later said that "modelling was never a big earner for me. I was unusual looking, so I couldn't go for commercial castings."

Career
Theatre
Atim graduated with a degree in biomedical science from King's College London and trained as an actor at the Weekend Arts Centre in Belsize Park, London. She became involved in a workshop for a new play, The Lightning Child, which led to her being cast by her acting teacher Ché Walker for her professional acting debut at Shakespeare's Globe in 2013. In 2020, she told the King's College alumni magazine that "I look back and feel a strong connection between my scientific and artistic sides. Science often comes up in my work – even the way I approach things in the rehearsal room is affected by having taken BioMed. Sometimes it’s little private parallels and analogies I make for myself."The Lightning Child, written by Walker and Arthur Darvill, ran for several weeks from mid-September 2013 and was the first musical staged at Shakespeare's Globe. It received mixed reviews, with the Financial Times describing it as "a bold experiment, but sadly not a successful one" and The Guardian review calling it "oddly conventional and pointlessly excessive". The Independent said that despite the production being overlong and having problems with the structure, it was "hard not to like" the show.
Atim played Keira, the physical embodiment of obsessive–compulsive disorder, in Ghost Town at the York Theatre Royal in early 2014. What's On Stage praised her "mesmeric physical presence" and The Yorkshire Times review said that Atim "dominated the stage". Following this, Atim appeared with Ako Mitchell in Walker's two-hander Klook's Last Stand, being praised by The Guardian for an energetic performance and "tremendous stage presence" by The Daily Telegraph. In the autumn of 2014 she appeared in Rachel at the Finborough Theatre and followed this by joining the touring production of Kae Tempest's Hopelessly Devoted. In addition to this, Atim played three roles in Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) productions: the Attendant in The Jew of Malta, Julia in Love's Sacrifice, and Assistant to Lady Politic Would-Be in Volpone. Walker's The Etienne Sisters, which included songs composed by Atim, opened two days before the end of her run in Volpone.

Leading roles
Atim's first major stage role was the non-speaking part of The Woman in Les Blancs at the National Theatre in 2016. The Stage said of her performance that "at the centre of the narrative is its most potent character: a gaunt, stooped and silent woman." The New York Times described a "spine-tingling production" and suggested that Atim's character may be an emblem of Africa. The Times later referred to her performance as "mesmerising".Atim received acclaim for her 2016 performances in the Donmar Warehouse's all-female Shakespeare Trilogy set in a women's prison, when she played Ferdinand in The Tempest, Gadshill and Lady Percy in Henry IV, and Lucius in Julius Caesar. The Guardian said Atim was "a glorious, giddy Ferdinand and a moving Lady Percy – [and] frequently seems to be physically stabbing the text as much as speaking it" and The Independent wrote "Sheila Atim (Ferdinand) and Leah Harvey (Miranda) are adorably funny and charming as they capture the giddy gaucheries of first love." Atim won a 2018 Clarence Derwent Award, presented to best supporting actors in London productions, for her roles in The Tempest and Les Blancs.Her leading role in Babette received a more mixed assessment, with The Times saying she was "the best thing about [the] production" while The Daily Telegraph review said "It's a pity ... that Babette, whose story this is, should remain, in Atim's somewhat remote performance, so distant a figure."She played Marianne Laine in the original run of the musical Girl from the North Country at The Old Vic in London from 26 July to 7 October 2017. Following the success of The Old Vic production, it transferred into London's West End at the Noël Coward Theatre from 29 December for a limited 12-week run until 24 March 2018. The play is set during the Great Depression and Atim's character Marianne Laine is a black woman, who was adopted by a white couple that run a struggling guesthouse. The character is pregnant and appears to have been forsaken by the father of her unborn child. The music for the show consists of songs by Bob Dylan and amongst the numbers that Atim performs are his "Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)" and "Idiot Wind". The Guardian described Atim as "outstanding" in the role, with delivery of "Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)" being "direct, unaffected and perfectly poised" and her performance of "Idiot Wind" a "beautiful reading". The Times stated that "Atim, in a strong cast, is standout," in an article that was headlined "She sings Dylan better than Bob." For her Girl from the North Country role, she received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Play at the 18th WhatsOnStage awards and won the 2018 Laurence Olivier award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical.In 2018, she played Emilia opposite Mark Rylance's Iago in Othello at Shakespeare's Globe, where according to The Independent, "she unleashed a fury that blew the greatest actor of his generation off the stage."Atim presented her first play as an author, Anguis, at the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It features Cleopatra being interviewed by a scientist and singing, Atim also having composed the songs. The Times considered it to be an "intriguing look at female power ... that marks [Atim] as a playwright to watch", whereas The Scotsman, while praising the songs and some performances, lamented that "the stories of the hugely privileged queen and the stressed-out modern black Londoner never quite come together as strongly as the situation promises."

Television, film, and music
Atim played Viola and Sebastian in a film version of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, and won the Screen Nation 2019 Best Female Performance film award. In 2018 she portrayed Limehouse Nell in ITV's Harlots.Atim plays piano, violin, bass, and drums. She composed the score for the play Time Is Love at London's Finborough Theatre in 2019, the year that she was named one of the cast of the Game of Thrones prequel series Bloodmoon. The planned series was cancelled following the pilot episode. She appeared as an alleged witch in the 2020 BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse and in 2021 she appeared in the television series The Underground Railroad and The Irregulars and the film Bruised.In June 2019, Atim was named an MBE for her services to drama. She is also on the Board of Trustees of The Old Vic Theatre Trust.
