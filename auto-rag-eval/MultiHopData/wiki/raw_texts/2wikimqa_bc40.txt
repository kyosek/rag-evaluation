Passage 3:
Paul Bartel
Paul Bartel (August 6, 1938 – May 13, 2000) was an American actor, writer and director. He was perhaps most known for his 1982 hit black comedy Eating Raoul, which he co-wrote, starred in and directed.
Bartel appeared in over 90 movies and TV episodes, including such titles as Eat My Dust (1976), Hollywood Boulevard (1976), Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), Get Crazy (1983), Chopping Mall (1986), and Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). He frequently co-starred with friend and former Warhol girl Mary Woronov; the pair appeared in 17 films together, often as husband and wife.
Bartel also directed 11 low-budget films, many of which he also acted in or wrote. He started in 1968 with the short The Secret Cinema, a paranoid delusional fantasy of self-referential cinema.  He graduated to features in 1972 with the horror-comedy Private Parts.  He would go on to direct such cult films as Death Race 2000 (1975), Eating Raoul (1982), Lust in the Dust (1985) and Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989).

Biography
Bartel studied film and theatre at UCLA, and spent a year on a Fulbright scholarship at the Centro Sperimentale film school in Rome, before returning to the US. He fulfilled his military service by talking his way into the Army Signal Corps Pictorial Center in Long Island City and later made films for the United States Information Agency.

Early films
Bartel's first films were made in high school, primarily abstract and animated 16mm shorts, including titles such as Cinema Experimental (1954), Non Objective Film (1956), Margaret Whiting Sings "The Money Tree" (1956), and Camel Rock (1957). After making the 35mm short Italian-language film Progetti (1962) while attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, Bartel produced The Secret Cinema (1966).  Shot on an extremely low budget in 35mm and with his own money, The Secret Cinema was the film that began his reputation as a new and unusual independent voice in narrative cinema.
He followed it with another short he wrote and directed, Naughty Nurse (1969). He co-wrote the feature Utterly Without Redeeming Social Value (1969), also starring in the lead. He worked as an actor only in Hi, Mom! (1970) directed by Brian De Palma.
Bartel's first feature as director was Private Parts (1972), a comedy horror film for MGM. It was produced by Gene Corman and Bartel was in the cast.

New World Pictures
Gene Corman's brother, Roger, ran a production company, New World Pictures, and hired Bartel to be second unit director on Big Bad Mama (1974), an action film. Bartel also played a small role.
Roger Corman gave Bartel the job of directing Death Race 2000 (1975), a satirical action comedy starring David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone and Mary Woronov. Bartel also played a small role. The film was a huge success at the box office and quickly established itself as a cult favorite.
Corman promptly offered Bartel the chance to direct a similar action film with Carradine for New World, Cannonball (1976). Bartel also worked on the script. The film is littered with cameos from people such as Joe Dante and Martin Scorsese. Bartel later said he worked for a year on Death Race 2000 for $5,000 "so when it was finished I desperately needed money. The only thing anybody wanted from me was another car picture, hence Cannonball. Corman had drummed into me the idea that if Death Race had been "harder" and "more real" it would have been more popular. Like a fool, I believed him. I am not, and never have been, very much interested in cars and racing" so he decided to load up the film with "cameos and character gimmicks that did interest me."Bartel was in much demand from other directors at New World to play small parts in their pictures: he appeared in Eat My Dust (1976) for Ron Howard, Hollywood Boulevard (1976) for Joe Dante and Alan Arkush (quite a large role, as a director, which Bartel credited for really kicking off his acting career), Mr Billions (1977) for Jonathan Kaplan (not a New World film but Bartel met Kaplan at the company), Grand Theft Auto (1977) for Howard, Piranha (1978) for Dante, and Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) for Arkush. Outside New World he appeared in The Hustler of Muscle Beach (1980) for Kaplan and Heartbeeps (1981) for Arkush.

Eating Raoul and after
Bartel wrote a script with Richard Blackburn, Eating Raoul (1982). Bartel managed to raise the finance and starred in the film along with Woronov. Made for $230,000 (raised by  himself and his parents) it was a hit on the art house circuit, grossing $10 million, and became a cult movie.
Bartel had small roles in White Dog (1982), directed by Sam Fuller and produced by New World alumni Jon Davison, Trick or Treats (1982), Heart Like a Wheel (1983) for Kaplan, and Get Crazy (1983) for Arkush.
The success of Eating Raoul enabled Bartel to raise $3 million in finance (ten times the budget of Raoul) for a screwball comedy he had co written and wanted to direct, Not for Publication (1984). It was a box-office disaster. More successful was Lust in the Dust (1985) starring Tab Hunter and Divine.
Bartel continued to be in demand as an actor, appearing in Frankenweenie (1984), a short for Tim Burton, Into the Night (1985) for John Landis, European Vacation (1985) for Amy Heckerling, and Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird (1985).
Bartel directed The Longshot (1986) based on a script by Tim Conway who starred. Bartel said he was a "director for hire" on the project. "My sensibility was on some level antipathetic to what Tim Conway wanted. I was trying to find interesting things under the surface, and he just wanted more surface."He appeared in an episode of Fame directed by Arkush, and reprised his Raoul character in Chopping Mall (1986) for Jim Wynorski produced by Julie Corman (Wynorski says Bartel and Woronov adlibbed their roles). He appeared in "The Jar", an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents directed by Burton, as well as the film Killer Party (1986).
He directed two episodes of Amazing Stories, both from his own scripts, both featuring him as an actor: "Secret Cinema" (a remake of his short film of the same name) and "Gershwin's Trunk".
He had roles in Munchies (1987) (produced by Roger Corman), Amazon Women on the Moon (1987) (in a segment directed by Dante), an episode of Crime Story, Baja Oklahoma (1988), and Shakedown (1988).
Bartel co wrote but did not direct Mortuary Academy (1988); he and Woronov also played small roles. He was an executive producer on Out of the Dark (1988), in which he had a small role. He had a role in Caddyshack II (1988) directed by Arkush.Bartel directed Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989), based on a story of his.He wrote a sequel to Eating Raoul called Bland Ambition, where Paul and Mary wind up running for Governor of California. It was about 10 days from the start of filming when Vestron withdrew its financial backing.Bartel appeared in Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog (1989), Far Out Man (1990), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) (for Dante), Dan Turner, Hollywood Detective (1990), an episode L.A. Law directed by Arkush, Liquid Dreams (1991), and Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (1991).
Bartel had a large supporting role in The Pope Must Diet (1991), directed by Peter Richardson of The Comic Strip, and was in The Living End (1992) from Gregg Araki, Soulmates (1992), and Posse (1993).
A musical adaptation of Eating Raoul premiered off Broadway in 1992.Bartel appeared in some episodes of The Comic Strip Presents..., even directing one ("Demonella"). He was in Acting on Impulse, Tales of the City and Grief (1993).
Bartel's last feature as director was Shelf Life (1993). Based on a play and done for a low budget, it struggled to find distribution.

Final years
Bartel appeared in Twin Sitters (1993), The Usual Suspects (1995), and The Jerky Boys (1995). He had a rare star role in The Wacky Adventures of Dr. Boris and Nurse Shirley (1995) but was normally seen in minor parts: Naomi & Wynonna: Love Can Build a Bridge (1995), Not Like Us (1995) for Corman's new company Concorde Pictures, A Bucket of Blood (1995) also for Concorde, Number One Fan (1995), Red Ribbon Blues (1996), Joe's Apartment (1996), Escape from L.A. (1996), and Basquiat (1996).
He directed 2 episodes of Clueless, "We Shall Overpack" and "Cher Inc". He also appeared in both.
He was in Prey of the Jaguar (1996), The Elevator (1996), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Boston Common, Skeletons (1997), The Inheritance (1997), Chicago Hope, The Devil's Child (1997), Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998), More Tales of the City, Race, Vengeance Unlimited, Dreamers, Hard Time: The Premonition, episodes of Ally McBeal and Snoops directed by Arkush, Good vs Evil, Zoo (1999), Hamlet (2000), Dinner and a Movie (2001) and Perfect Fit (2001).

Personal life
Bartel was openly gay; this influenced his career choice, as he found himself more accepted and afforded more opportunities within the independent film industry than he would have in Hollywood.In 1979, he was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival.

Death
Bartel died May 13, 2000, of a heart attack two weeks after liver cancer surgery; he was 61 years old. His final screen appearance was a posthumous role as "Dad" alongside Mary Woronov ("Mom") in the 2001 independent film Perfect Fit.

Legacy
The Belgian horror movie Calvaire paid a tribute to the late Bartel – the mad innkeeper character is named "Paul Bartel".
Two of Bartel's early directorial efforts, Progetti and The Secret Cinema, were restored by the Academy Film Archive.

Passage 5:
Raoul Walsh
Raoul Walsh (born Albert Edward Walsh; March 11, 1887 – December 31, 1980) was an American film director, actor, founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), and the brother of silent screen actor George Walsh. He was known for portraying John Wilkes Booth in the silent film The Birth of a Nation (1915) and for directing such films as the widescreen epic The Big Trail (1930) starring John Wayne in his first leading role, The Roaring Twenties starring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, High Sierra (1941) starring Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart, and White Heat (1949) starring James Cagney and Edmond O'Brien. He directed his last film in 1964. His work has been noted as influences on directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Jack Hill, and Martin Scorsese.

Biography
Walsh was born in New York as Albert Edward Walsh to Elizabeth T. Bruff, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants, and Thomas W. Walsh, an Englishman. Walsh was part of Omega Gamma Delta in high school, as was his younger brother. Growing up in New York, Walsh was also a friend of the Barrymore family. John Barrymore recalled spending time reading in the Walsh family library as a youth. Later in life, Walsh lived in Palm Springs, California. He was buried at Assumption Cemetery Simi Valley, Ventura County, California.

Film career
Walsh was educated at Seton Hall College. He began acting in 1909, first as a stage actor in New York City and later as a film actor. In  1913 he changed his name to Raoul Walsh. In 1914 he became an assistant to D. W. Griffith and made his first full-length feature film, The Life of General Villa, shot on location in Mexico with Pancho Villa playing the lead, and with actual ongoing battles filmed in progress as well as battle recreations.  Walsh played John Wilkes Booth in Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation (1915) and also served as an assistant director. This movie was followed by the critically acclaimed Regeneration in 1915, the earliest feature gangster film, shot on location in Manhattan's Bowery district.
Walsh served as an officer in the United States Army during World War I. He later directed The Thief of Bagdad (1924), starring Douglas Fairbanks and Anna May Wong, and Laurence Stallings' What Price Glory? (1926), starring Victor McLaglen and Dolores del Río.

In Sadie Thompson (1928), starring Gloria Swanson as a prostitute seeking a new life in Samoa, Walsh starred as Swanson's boyfriend in his first acting role since 1915; he also directed the film. He was then hired to direct and star in In Old Arizona, a film about O. Henry's character the Cisco Kid. While on location for that film Walsh was in a car crash when a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield as he was driving through the desert; he lost his right eye as a result. He gave up the part and never acted again. Warner Baxter won an Oscar for the role Walsh was originally slated to play. Walsh would wear an eyepatch for the rest of his life.

In the early days of sound with Fox, Walsh directed the first widescreen spectacle, The Big Trail (1930), an epic wagon train western shot on location, across the West. The movie starred John Wayne, then unknown, whom Walsh discovered as prop man named Marion Morrison, and he was renamed after the Revolutionary War general Mad Anthony Wayne; Walsh happened to be reading a book about him at the time. Walsh directed The Bowery (1933), featuring Wallace Beery, George Raft, Fay Wray and Pert Kelton; the energetic movie recounts the story of Steve Brodie (Raft), supposedly the first man to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and live to brag about it.
An undistinguished period followed with Paramount Pictures from 1935 to 1939, but Walsh's career rose to new heights after he moved to Warner Brothers, with The Roaring Twenties (1939), featuring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart; Dark Command (1940), with John Wayne and Roy Rogers (at Republic Pictures); They Drive By Night (1940), with George Raft, Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and Bogart; High Sierra (1941), with Lupino and Bogart again; They Died with Their Boots On (1941), with Errol Flynn as Custer; The Strawberry Blonde (1941), with Cagney and Olivia de Havilland; Manpower (1941), with Edward G. Robinson, Marlene Dietrich and George Raft; and White Heat (1949), with Cagney. Walsh's contract at Warners expired in 1953.
He directed several films afterwards, including three with Clark Gable: The Tall Men (1955), The King and Four Queens (1956) and Band of Angels (1957). Walsh retired in 1964. He died of a heart attack in 1980.

Outside interests

Their horse Sunset Trail competed in the 1937 Kentucky Derby won by War Admiral who went on to win the U.S. Triple Crown. Sunset Trail finished sixteenth in a field of twenty runners.Some of Walsh's film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.

When asked about his favorite films of his formative years Sandler said, "I fell in love with Jean Luc Godard’s Contempt and Weekend. I was blown away by Agnes Varda’s Cleo from 5 to 7. Michelangelo Antonioni’s films really struck a chord with me as well. After seeing L’Avventura and Blowup, I went online and ordered every film of his I could find. The Passenger’s penultimate shot blew me away. I watched that 7 minute shot over and over. It’s probably my favorite shot in the history of cinema."

Critical reception
Angelica Jade Bastien for Roger Ebert wrote of the film, "In 'Live Cargo,' director/co-writer Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions."Chuck Wilson for The Village Voice wrote, "The well-acted Live Cargo, which also features Robert Wisdom and Sam Dillon, is at its best when it observes character acting silently against landscape, as when Nadine goes snorkeling and uses a spear gun to jab at sharks, a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human fury typical of Sandler’s poetic approach.” Wilson as well called Sandler "a filmmaker to watch."Katie Walsh in her IndieWire review wrote, ”Anchored by a quartet of equally strong and understated performances, LIVE CARGO proves itself to be a singularly artful film of great emotional heft.”  Walsh gave the film an A - grade.Stephen Saito for The Moveable Fest in his review and interview wrote, "While there’s intrigue aplenty as anxieties rise higher than the tide, the assured hand of director Logan Sandler, who co-wrote the script with Thymaya Payne, guides 'Live Cargo' admirably as a thriller that may appear immediately as monochrome but shifts quickly into varying degrees of grey.”H. Nelson Tracey of Cinemacy wrote that Sandler's, “Live Cargo is an unforgettable debut and a promise of greater heights to come.”Justin Lowe of the Hollywood Reporter in his review stated, “A pronounced sense of style and place suffuses the entire film, boding well for Sandler’s future projects.”
