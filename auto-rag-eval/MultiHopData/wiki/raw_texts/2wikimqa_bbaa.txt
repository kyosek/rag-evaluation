Passage 6:
Inoue Masaru (bureaucrat)
Viscount Inoue Masaru (井上 勝, August 25, 1843 – August 2, 1910) was the first Director of Railways in Japan and is known as the "father of the Japanese railways".

Biography
He was born into the Chōshū clan at Hagi, Yamaguchi, the son of Katsuyuki Inoue. He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.
Masaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Chōshū fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Chōshū clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896. In 1909 he was appointed President of the Imperial Railway Association. He died of an illness in London in 1910, during an official visit on behalf of the Ministry of Railways.

Honors
Inoue and his friends later came to be known as the Chōshū Five. To commemorate their stay in London, two scholarships, known as the Inoue Masaru Scholarships, are available each session under the University College London 1863 Japan Scholarships scheme to enable University College students to study at a Japanese University. The value of the scholarships are £3000 each.
His tomb is in the triangular area of land where the Tōkaidō Main Line meets the Tōkaidō Shinkansen in Kita-Shinagawa.

Passage 7:
Ken Forsch
Kenneth Roth Forsch (born September 8, 1946) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right-handed pitcher from 1970 to 1984, most prominently as a member of the Houston Astros where he helped the franchise win its first-ever National League Western Division title and postseason berth in 1980. A two-time All-Star player, Forsch pitched a no-hitter for the Astros on April 7, 1979. He ended his baseball career playing for the California Angels.

Career
Forsch was born in Sacramento, California where he graduated from Hiram Johnson High School and later attended the Oregon State University where he played for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team through the 1967–1968 seasons. He was selected by the Houston Astros in the 18th round (399th overall) of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on September 7, 1970 at the age of 23.Forsch was selected to the All-Star Game in 1976 and 1981.On April 7, 1979, Forsch no-hit the Atlanta Braves 6–0 at the Astrodome. His brother Bob Forsch, who also pitched for the Astros, hurled two no-hitters while with the St. Louis Cardinals, making them the only set of brothers to pitch no-hitters in MLB history. The 1980 season went down to the wire, and Forsch was a part of the action. He went 12-13 during the season with a 3.20 ERA and on a then career-high 222.1 innings pitched; the rotation of him, Nolan Ryan, Joe Niekro, and J. R. Richard was slated to make a run at the National League West title, which they missed winning by one game the previous year. However, a stroke suffered by Richard late in the year saw the eventual end of his career. The Astros required a one-game playoff on October 6 after the Astros lost three straight games to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Dodger Stadium. Forsch had lost the first game on October 3 when trying to hang on to a precarious 2-1 lead. However, a single and a subsequent error set the stage for a Ron Cey base hit with two out to send the game into the 10th inning. On the first batter of the inning, Forsch allowed a home run that gave the Dodgers a 3-2 victory. The Astros prevailed in the tiebreaker game thanks to the efforts of Joe Niekro that set the Astros up in the 1980 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies for Game 1 on the following day of October 7. Forsch was selected to start the game, which was the first playoff game in the history of the Astros. Facing Steve Carlton at Veterans Stadium, Forsch went eight innings and allowed three runs on eight hits with a walk and five strikeouts, as the Phillies broke through in the 6th on a two-run home run by Greg Luzinski and an pinch hit RBI single by Greg Gross in the 7th that got the Phillies a 3-1 victory. In Game 5, the Astros were on the verge of a pennant but needed relief down the stretch. They were leading 5-2 in the 8th inning, but Nolan Ryan had been taken out after allowing three hits and a walk to make the score 5-3 with the bases loaded. Forsch was put in after Joe Sambito had got a groundout to make it 5-4 with one out and two on. He struck out Mike Schmidt, but when facing Del Unser, Forsch allowed a base hit to right field that tied the game at 5. Now facing Manny Trillo, Forsch delivered a pitch that was smacked for a triple to left to clear the bases and give the Phillies a 7-5 lead. Forsch was pinch hit for in the 9th, which saw the Astros tie the game in the eventual loss in the 10th inning. It was the last appearance of Forsch in an Astros uniform and his only experience in the postseason. He was traded to the California Angels for Dickie Thon in April of 1981, eschewing the idea of being relegated to the bullpen and demanding a trade when general manager Al Rosen had acquired Don Sutton and Bob Knepper in the offseason.
In the strike-shortened 1981 season, Forsch went 11-7 with a 2.88 ERA in 153 innings, pitching a league high four shutouts while having 55 strikeouts. He was named to the All-Star Game for the second and final time. He went 13-11 in 1982, but he did not pitch in the postseason run by the Angels that saw them lose in the ALCS in five games. He went 11-12 in 1983 before suffering a setback in 1984, where he pitched in just two games, as he suffered a dislocated shoulder on April 7 when diving to the bag on a fielding play that had him land on his right elbow. He returned as a free agent in 1986, pitching as a middleman in ten games for 17 innings that saw him have a 9.53 ERA before being released on May 25.
During his 16-year career, Forsch compiled 114 wins, 1,047 strikeouts, and a 3.37 earned run average. After his career ended, He worked in commercial real estate along with serving as a member of the Angels’ Speakers Bureau before applying to work for the Angels as their director of player development, which was accepted. He worked for four years before having a promotion to assistant general manager in 1998. He won a World Series ring when the Angels won the championship in 2002. He was dismissed in 2011.

Passage 10:
Jim Wilson (pitcher)
James Alger Wilson (February 20, 1922 – September 2, 1986) was an American professional baseball pitcher, scout and front-office executive. Although he was well-traveled as a player and compiled a career winning percentage of only .491 in 175 decisions, he threw the first no-hit, no-run game in Milwaukee's Major League history and was a three-time (1954–56) All-Star who represented both the National and American leagues.  During his front office career he served as the third general manager in the franchise history of the Milwaukee Brewers.

Career
As a player
A native of San Diego, Wilson threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He attended San Diego State University.
Wilson pitched in all or part of 12 seasons (1945–46; 1948–49; 1951–58) for five Major League franchises and six different cities: the Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Browns/Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston / Milwaukee Braves and Chicago White Sox.  He began his pro career during World War II in 1943 in the Red Sox' farm system and in his second year, 1944, he won 19 games with the top-level Louisville Colonels of the American Association. He made the 1945 Red Sox' roster coming out of spring training and started 21 games for them during the season's first four months. In his 21st start, on August 9 at Briggs Stadium,  Wilson worked into the tenth inning of a 3–3 game. With one out, Detroit Tigers' slugger Hank Greenberg hit a line drive back through the box that struck Wilson in the head, fracturing his skull and sending him to Henry Ford Hospital. The injury sidelined Wilson for the rest of the campaign and he would pitch only one more game for the Red Sox, on April 23, 1946.
Wilson returned to Louisville for the balance of 1946 and all of 1947, then was included in a trade to the Browns that yielded slugging shortstop Vern Stephens and starting pitcher Jack Kramer. But 1948 and 1949 saw Wilson bounce among four organizations—the Browns, Cleveland Indians, Tigers and Athletics—and make ineffective appearances in six total big-league games for the Browns and A's.  Finally, in 1950, he was acquired by the Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, managed by Paul Richards. Wilson won 24 games (losing 11) for a sixth-place team and led the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts. His contract was purchased by the Boston Braves at season's end, and Wilson returned to the Major Leagues for good.
Wilson's first All-Star season came in 1954 for the Milwaukee Braves; they had moved from Boston in March 1953. He no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies, 2–0 at Milwaukee County Stadium on June 12 of that season. The 32-year-old right-hander beat future Hall of Famer Robin Roberts in the one-hour and 43-minute contest. Wilson issued two bases on balls (both to Phillies' catcher Smoky Burgess) and struck out six. The no-hitter was the first in the Braves' Milwaukee history.  Wilson was named an All-Star in the midst of an 8–2 season in 27 games pitched with three other complete game shutouts for the contending Braves. But he did not get into the 1954 Midsummer classic, an 11–9 loss for his National League squad at Cleveland Municipal Stadium.
On the eve of the 1955 season, Richards, by now both the general manager and field manager of the Baltimore Orioles, purchased Wilson's contract and moved him into the starting rotation. Wilson led the American League in games lost (18) that season (as a team, Baltimore lost 97 games), but he again registered four shutouts and was selected to the AL All-Star team, chosen to play in the July 12, 1955, game at his old home field, County Stadium. But again Wilson did not appear and, again, his team was defeated, with the Senior Circuit winning 6–5 in 12 innings.

Wilson began 1956 by winning four of his first six decisions in seven starts for Baltimore despite sporting a high (5.03) earned run average. On May 21, Richards traded him to the first-division White Sox, and although he pitched more effectively, he registered only a 9–12 record for Chicago. Nevertheless, Wilson was selected to the 1956 American League All-Star team, and this time he played in the game at Griffith Stadium in Washington, working one inning in the AL's 7–3 loss, allowing two hits and one earned run, although he retired Willie Mays on a called third strike to register the final out.That set the stage for Wilson's most successful big-league season, with the 1957 White Sox. He won a career-high 15 games (losing eight), and led the American League in shutouts, with five. However, he did not earn a place on the 1957 AL All-Star team.  In 1958, the 36-year-old Wilson concluded his 16-season playing career, working in 28 games for the White Sox, 23 in a starting role. In his final MLB game, September 14 against the Washington Senators, he worked 82⁄3 innings and surrendered five earned runs, but was credited with the victory in a 6–5 Chicago triumph. That season he also continued his skein of errorless games as a pitcher. On June 15, 1955, as an Oriole, he muffed an eighth-inning foul pop-up by the White Sox' Jim Rivera for an error. It was the last miscue he would commit in his career, which spanned 116 games through his 1958 retirement. Wilson posted a career .988  fielding percentage, committing only 4 miscues in  333 total chances.
Altogether, Wilson appeared in 257 Major League games pitched, 217 as a starter. He compiled an 86–89 won-lost mark, with 75 complete games and 19 shutouts. In 1,539 innings pitched he notched 692 strikeouts. Wilson also allowed 1,479 hits, 608 bases on balls and 686 earned runs. His career earned run average was 4.01.

As a scout and executive
Wilson remained in the game as a scout for the Orioles and Houston Astros. He and scout Jim Russo signed Jim Palmer for the Orioles in 1963. Palmer recalled in a 1996 book that though 13 teams were interested in him, the Orioles scouts set themselves apart with their polite manners. In 1971, Wilson came back to Milwaukee as the director of scouting and player development of the Brewers, a three-year-old expansion team, and following the 1972 season, he succeeded Frank Lane as Milwaukee's general manager. Although Lane was renowned as a trader, Wilson completed a blockbuster transaction of his own with the Phillies on October 31, 1972, acquiring third baseman Don Money in a seven-player deal. Money would play 11 seasons for the Brewers and make four American League All-Star teams.  Then, in June 1973, during his first draft as Brewers' general manager, Wilson selected Robin Yount with the club's first pick (third overall).  After one season in minor league baseball, Wilson promoted the 18-year-old Yount to the 1974 Brewers, the beginning of a 20-season, Hall of Fame career for the shortstop and center fielder.
But Wilson's stay as general manager in Milwaukee was not a long one. After the 1974 season he returned to California to become executive director of the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau. He stepped down in 1985 after being stricken with cancer and died in Newport Beach at age 64 on September 2, 1986.
