Vane inherited the Tempest estates in County Durham (notably Wynyard and Brancepeth) upon condition he adopt the name and arms of Tempest. He therefore changed his surname to Vane-Tempest.
He accepted the Chiltern Hundreds in 1800 before returning to Parliament as representative for the County Durham from 1807 until his death from apoplexy in 1813. He was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim in 1805.Vane-Tempest inherited his father's baronetcy in 1794. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Durham volunteer cavalry in early 1797.

On Vane-Tempest's death without a male heir in 1813, the baronetcy became extinct.
