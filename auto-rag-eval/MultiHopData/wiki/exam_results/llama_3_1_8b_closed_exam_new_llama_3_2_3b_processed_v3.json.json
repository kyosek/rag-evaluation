    "question": "The Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage, led by Maud Arncliffe Sennett, was formed in response to the refusal of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to meet with a delegation of Scottish women who sought to extend the franchise to women. This event occurred in July 1913. According to historical records, Maud Arncliffe Sennett had previously convened the first meeting of the Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee in January 1867. However, it was not until her encounter with Lilly Maxwell, a widowed shop owner, that she became determined to fight for women's suffrage. Maxwell's name was mistakenly added to the voter register in Manchester, and Becker, a key figure in the movement, helped her to vote. This event took place several months after the first meeting of the Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee. The Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee had been influenced by the events of the 1297 Battle of Stirling Bridge, which exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The committee's efforts were also shaped by the experiences of the English magnates who opposed King Edward I's taxation policies, including the Remonstrances, a document that summarized their grievances. Becker had previously campaigned for women's suffrage in municipal elections and had been successful in securing the vote for women in 1869. She had also founded the Women's Suffrage Journal and organized speaking tours of women, which helped to raise awareness about the issue. In 1870, Becker was elected to the Manchester School Board, where she served until her death. The Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage was also influenced by the Women's Freedom League, which had a song, \"Justice For Ever,\" that was sung at their events. The song's lyrics emphasized the importance of women's suffrage and the need for action to achieve justice.",
