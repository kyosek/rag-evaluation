In some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true?",

Maria Isabel's mother, Carlota Joaquina, sent her eldest son, Pedro, to join his father and grandmother onboard the ship Principe Real, while she and the rest of her children boarded the Affonso d'Albuquerque. Upon their arrival in Brazil, Carlota and her children were forced to shave their heads and wear white muslin hats.\n\nMaria Isabel's mother, Carlota Joaquina, attempted to have King John VI deemed insane.
