    "question": "In 1840, Charles Wheatstone introduced a device called the chronoscope, which was used to measure minute intervals of time. This device was capable of distinguishing 1/7300 part of a second and was used to determine the speed of a bullet or the passage of a star. Wheatstone also exhibited an electro-magnetic clock at the Royal Society on 26 November 1840, which was capable of distributing the correct time to local timepieces. Alexander Bain, who worked as a mechanist for Wheatstone from August to December 1840, later accused Wheatstone of stealing his ideas for an electric clock and an electro-magnetic printing telegraph. However, Wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during May. In the same year, Bain mentioned his financial problems to the editor of the Mechanics Magazine, who introduced him to Wheatstone. Bain demonstrated his models to Wheatstone, who dismissed them as having no future. Three months later, Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his own invention. What was the primary purpose of the chronoscope introduced by Charles Wheatstone in 1840?",
