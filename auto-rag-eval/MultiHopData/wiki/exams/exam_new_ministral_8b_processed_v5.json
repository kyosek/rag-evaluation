    "documentation": [
      "Nonetheless, he grew up to become a strong, athletic, and imposing man. At 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) he towered over most of his contemporaries, hence his epithet \"Longshanks\", meaning \"long legs\" or \"long shins\". The historian Michael Prestwich states that his \"long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman. In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it turned white. The regularity of his features was marred by a drooping left eyelid ... His speech, despite a lisp, was said to be persuasive. \"In 1254, English fears of a Castilian invasion of the English-held province of Gascony induced King Henry to arrange a politically expedient marriage between fifteen-year-old Edward and thirteen-year-old Eleanor, the half-sister of King Alfonso X of Castile. They were married on 1 November 1254 in the Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas in Castile. As part of the marriage agreement, Alfonso X gave up his claims to Gascony, and Edward received grants of land worth 15,000 marks a year. The marriage eventually led to the English acquisition of Ponthieu in 1279 upon Eleanor's inheritance of the county. Henry made sizeable endowments to Edward in 1254, including Gascony; most of Ireland, which was granted to Edward with the stipulation that it would never be separated from the English crown; and much land in Wales and England, including the Earldom of Chester. They offered Edward little independence for Henry retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, and benefited from most of the income from those lands. Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester had been appointed as royal lieutenant of Gascony the year before and drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province. Around the end of November, Edward and Eleanor left Castile and entered Gascony, where they were warmly received by the populace. Here, Edward styled himself as \"ruling Gascony as prince and lord\", a move that the historian J. S. Hamilton states was a show of his blooming political independence.",
      "Edward travelled by way of Savoy to receive homage from his uncle Count Philip I for castles in the Alps held by a treaty of 1246.Edward then journeyed to Gascony to order its affairs and put down a revolt headed by Gaston de B\u00e9arn. While there, he launched an investigation into his feudal possessions, which, as Hamilton puts it, reflects \"Edward's keen interest in administrative efficiency ... [and] reinforced Edward's position as lord in Aquitaine and strengthened the bonds of loyalty between the king-duke and his subjects\". Around the same time, the King organised political alliances with the kingdoms in Iberia. His four-year-old daughter Eleanor was promised in marriage to Alfonso, the heir to the Kingdom of Aragon, and Edward's heir Henry was betrothed to Joan, heiress to the Kingdom of Navarre. Neither union would come to fruition. Only on 2 August 1274 did Edward return to England, landing at Dover. The thirty-five-year-old king held his coronation on 19 August at Westminster Abbey, alongside Queen Eleanor. Immediately after being anointed and crowned by Robert Kilwardby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward removed his crown, saying that he did not intend to wear it again until he had recovered all the crown lands that his father had surrendered during his reign. Early reign, 1274\u20131296\nConquest of Wales\nLlywelyn ap Gruffudd enjoyed an advantageous situation in the aftermath of the Barons' War. The 1267 Treaty of Montgomery recognised his ownership of land he had conquered in the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad and his title of Prince of Wales. Armed conflicts nevertheless continued, in particular with certain dissatisfied Marcher Lords, such as the Earl of Gloucester, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford. Problems were exacerbated when Llywelyn's younger brother Dafydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys, after failing in an assassination attempt against Llywelyn, defected to the English in 1274. Citing ongoing hostilities and Edward's harbouring of his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to the King."

      "Passage 1:\nJohn Vernou Bouvier III\nJohn Vernou \"Black Jack\" Bouvier III ( BOO-vee-ay; May 19, 1891 \u2013 August 3, 1957) was an American Wall Street stockbroker and socialite. He was the father of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and of socialite Lee Radziwill, and was the father-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Early life and education\nJohn Vernou Bouvier III was born in Manhattan in 1891. His nickname, \"Black Jack\", referred to his flamboyant lifestyle. Bouvier's great-grandfather, Michel Charles Bouvier (1792-1874), was a French cabinetmaker from Pont-Saint-Esprit, Occitania. Michel immigrated to Philadelphia in 1815 after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars, worked for Joseph Bonaparte, married, was widowed, and then married Louise Clifford Vernou (1811-1872).In addition to crafting fine furniture, Michel Bouvier had a business distributing firewood. To support that business, he acquired large tracts of forested land, some of which contained a large reserve of coal. Michel further grew his fortune in real estate speculation. His sons, Eustes, Michel Charles (M.C.), and John V. Bouvier Sr., distinguished themselves in the world of finance on Wall Street. They left their fortunes to their only remaining male Bouvier heir, Major John Vernou Bouvier Jr. (1866-1948), who used some of the money to buy an estate known as Lasata in East Hampton, Long Island. Major John Vernou Bouvier, Jr., a successful attorney, and Maude Frances Sergeant (1869-1940) had five children, of whom John Vernou Bouvier III was the eldest. Their other children were William Sergeant \"Bud\" Bouvier, who was born in 1893 and died from alcoholism in 1929; Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, who was born in 1895 and became the wife of Phelan Beale, Sr. and the mother of Edith Bouvier Beale, Phelan Beale, Jr., and Bouvier Beale; and twins Maude Reppelin Bouvier Davis and Michelle Caroline Bouvier Scott Putnam (born 1905).John Vernou Bouvier III attended Philips Exeter Academy and Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. He then studied at Columbia College, his father's alma mater, where he played tennis for two years before transferring to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University.",
      "Passage 1:\nH. H. Hunnewell\nHoratio Hollis Hunnewell (July 27, 1810 \u2013 May 20, 1902) was an American railroad financier, philanthropist, amateur botanist, and one of the most prominent horticulturists in America in the nineteenth century. Hunnewell was a partner in the private banking firm of Welles & Co. Paris, France controlled by his in-laws, which specialized in trade finance between the two countries. Practicing horticulture for nearly six decades on his estate in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he was perhaps the first person to cultivate and popularize rhododendrons in the United States. Early life\nHunnewell was born on July 27, 1810 in Watertown, Massachusetts. He was a son of Susanna (n\u00e9e Cooke) Hunnewell and Dr. Walter Hunnewell, who graduated from Harvard College in 1787, in the same class with John Quincy Adams. His paternal grandparents were Revolutionary War soldier Richard Hunnewell and Eunice (n\u00e9e Thompson) Hunnewell, and his maternal grandparents were Phineas Cooke and Abigail (n\u00e9e Durant) Cooke. Career\nHunnewell was a director of the Illinois Central Railroad from 1862 to 1871. He was a railroad entrepreneur in Kansas beginning in the 1860s, and president of the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Gulf Railroad and Kansas City, Lawrence and Southern Railroad around 1880. At the time of his death he was a director of 12 railroads and numerous mining, real estate, and other ventures. Philanthropy\nH. H. Hunnewell made a donation in 1873 that helped Asa Gray revise and complete his Flora of North America. He also funded the conifer collection at Arnold Arboretum, Boston, Massachusetts, and donated the Arboretum's administration building (now Hunnewell Building) in 1892. Hunnewell was a friend and neighbor of Henry Fowle Durant (1822-1881), who founded Wellesley College on Lake Waban directly across from Hunnewell's estate. Hunnewell made a donation to the College for Eliot Dormitory in 1887, and endowed the College's Chair of Botany in 1901.The town of Wellesley's greatest benefactor, Hunnewell built and donated the Wellesley Town Hall and Free Library building (completed 1885), along with 10 acres of adjoining parkland."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "M\u00e1el Coluim mac Gille Brigte captured Uchtred. Uchtred was blinded, castrated and had his tongue cut out. What Gille Brigte did at this time might have changed British history for ever. Gille Brigte sent a messenger, and asked King Henry II for direct lordship (i.e. without the Scottish king as a middle man). Henry sent a delegation to investigate. This delegation consisted of Roger de Hoveden and Robert de Vaux. Thanks to the former, we have a record of the embassy. It is reported by Benedict of Peterborough that Gille Brigte offered the King of England a one-off payment of 2000 marks, and a yearly tribute of 500 cows and 500 swine, if the King would \"remove them [the Galwegians] from the servitude of the king of Scotland\" (Anderson,  p. 258). However, when the delegation discovered the fate of Uchtred, Henry's cousin, they rejected the request. Gille Brigte's fratricide effectively prevented any deal. Gille Brigte's bad fortune was compounded later in the year, when Henry and William signed the Treaty of Falaise. Gille Brigte was forced to come to terms with the two kings. In 1176, Gille Brigte travelled into England, was fined 1000 marks by Henry, and handed over his son Donnchad into Henry's custody as a hostage to ensure good behaviour. The Lordship of Gille Brigte\nGille Brigte's reign is characterized by a large degree of hostility towards the Scottish kings. Unlike his brother Uchtred, he was no friend to incoming Normans. He maintained a Gaelic following. Such a policy made him popular in the province, but alienated him from his nominal Franco-Gaelic overlords, King M\u00e1el Coluim IV and then King William. William cultivated the loyalty of Uchtred's son Lochlann (Roland), using him as a card in the game for control over the Galwegian lordship. In the 1180s, tension between Gille Brigte and William was high, with Gilla Brigte being known to have made frequent raids into the Scottish controlled territory of eastern Galloway. When Gille Brigte died in 1185, he was at war with William.",
      "Gilla Brigte was one of two sons of the great Fergus, the builder of the \"Kingdom\" of Galloway. Background, marriage and family\nIn the struggle that arose after the death of Fergus between Gille Brigte and Uchtred, Gille Brigte emerged the stronger. The partitioning of Galloway left Gille Brigte with the western part, the part less exposed to the armies of the Scottish and English Kings. We do not know for certain to whom Gille Brigte was married. Richard Oram suggests the strong likelihood that his main wife was a daughter of Donnchad II, Mormaer or Earl of Fife and the most important native lord in Scotland. The introduction of the name Donnchad (or Duncan) into the family naming pattern is some evidence of this, as is the later marriage of Gille Brigte's great-granddaughter Marjorie to the Fife petty-lord Adam de Kilconquhar. Gille Brigte had two known children: Donnchad\nM\u00e1el Coluim\n\nEvents of 1174 & approach to England\nFrom 1161 until 1174, Gille Brigte and Uchtred shared the lordship, with Gille Brigte in the west, and Uchtred in the east. In 1174, King William le Lion of Scotland invaded England in an attempt to regain Northumberland. He brought with him the two meic Fergusa, Gille Brigte and Uchtred. During the invasion, William was caught off-guard, and captured while besieging the castle at Alnwick. Benedict of Peterborough reported that:\n\nWhen they [the brothers] heard that their lord the king of Scotland was taken, they immediately returned with their Galwegians to their own lands, and at once expelled from Galloway all the bailiffs and guards whom the king of Scotland had set over them; and all the English and French whom they could seize they slew; and all the defences and castles which the king of Scotland had established in their land they besieged, captured and destroyed, and slew all whom they took within them\nDespite the implications that both brothers were involved, it is clear that only Gilla Brigte was, and that Uchtred opposed him. For Benedict goes on to tell us that, in relation to the same year, Gille Brigte's son M\u00e1el Coluim was besieging Uchtred on an island in Galloway."

Passage 2:\nCarry On Emmannuelle\nCarry On Emmannuelle is a 1978 British comedy film, the 30th release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958\u20131992). The film was to be the final Carry On for many regulars, including Kenneth Williams (in his 26th Carry On), Kenneth Connor (in his 17th), Joan Sims (in her 24th) and Peter Butterworth (in his 16th). Jack Douglas is the only regular from this film to bridge the gap to Carry On Columbus. Beryl Reid, Henry McGee and Suzanne Danielle make their only appearances in the series here. The film featured a change in style, becoming more openly sexual and explicit. This was highlighted by the implied behaviour of Danielle's character, though she does not bare any more flesh than any other Carry On female lead. These changes brought the film closer to the then popular series of X-rated Confessions... comedies, or indeed the actual Emmanuelle films that it parodies. This film, as well as the original cut of Carry On England were the only films in the series to be certified AA by the British Board of Film Censors, which restricted audiences to those aged 14 and over. The film was followed by the final installment of the series Carry On Columbus 1992. Plot\nEmmannuelle Pr\u00e9vert (Suzanne Danielle) relieves the boredom of a flight on Concorde by seducing timid Theodore Valentine (Larry Dann).",

The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \"sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer. Track listing\nThe 7\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \"Culling of the Fold\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \"After the Bombs\" as the B-side. Music videos\nFor the \"O Valencia!\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report. On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \"O Valencia!\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \"the Boss\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \"Valencia\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \"Office\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \"O\", creating the title of the song.",

He later served in the Shropshire Yeomanry, becoming its commanding officer as lieutenant-colonel from 1902 to 1907, and was honorary colonel from 1908.

      "He died at Porkington and was buried at Selattyn. He had 3 sons (one of whom predeceased him) and 2 daughters. His eldest son John Ormsby Gore was M.P. for Caernarvonshire and created Baron Harlech in 1876. His second son William became 2nd Baron Harlech after the death of his brother. Passage 3:\nThomas Gladstones\nThomas Gladstones (3 June 1732 \u2013 12 May 1809) was a Scottish flour merchant and philanthropist. He was the father of Sir John Gladstone and the grandfather of the British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. Early life\nBorn at the farm of Mid Toftcombs in the parish of Biggar, Lanarkshire, Thomas Gladstones was the fourth son of John Gladstones (c.1696\u20131757), a miller and farmer at Mid Toftcombs. John Gladstones also served as an elder of Biggar Kirk. Thomas's elder brother, James, was a Church of Scotland minister and rector of Leith Academy. In 1746, when he was aged 14, Thomas's father arranged for him to be apprenticed to Alexander Somerville, a wine merchant in Leith. When Thomas completed his apprenticeship he decided that the corn trade offered better prospects than did wine, and he established himself in Leith as a provision merchant and corn dealer, eventually trading at both wholesale and retail. He died in 1809 at his home on Coalhill in Leith. Marriage and family\nOn 21 April 1762, Gladstones married Nelly Neilson (1738\u20131806), the daughter of Walter Neilson, a merchant from Springfield near Edinburgh. They had sixteen children together, the second-born, and eldest son, being Sir John Gladstones. Career\nThomas Gladstones' corn business prospered during the 1760s. His business operated from a shop at the front of his house on Coalhill in Leith. Thomas became the lessee of the Dalry paper mill, where he appointed his brother-in-law, James Murray, as superintendent. He also bought and sold grain from the Baltic ports, was an investor in a Leith whaling syndicate, owned a number of trading ships, and had an interest in the sulfuric acid plants at Barrowmuirhead, near Leith."

      "Passage 1:\nGeorg, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen\nGeorg, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen (11 October 1892 \u2013 6 January 1946) was the head of the house of Saxe-Meiningen from 1941 until his death. Biography He was born in Kassel the eldest son of Prince Frederick Johann of Saxe-Meiningen (1861-1914) and Countess Adelaide of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1870\u20131948). His father was a son of Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his mother a daughter of Count Ernst of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Georg studied law at the Universities of Munich and Jena. Georg suspended his studies to serve in World War I and saw action as a Captain in a cavalry regiment. His uncle Bernhard III abdicated on 10 November 1918 following the German Revolution as the German monarchies were abolished. After the war he resumed his law studies and for a time served as a substitute judge for the town of Hildburghausen in the Free State of Thuringia. On 1 May 1933 he joined the Nazis, becoming NSDAP member (# 2.594.794). After the death of his uncle Ernst on 29 December 1941, Georg succeeded to the headship of the house of Saxe-Meiningen and assumed the title of Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and style Georg III. Georg died in the Russian prisoner of war camp near Cherepovets (Tscherepowetz in German) in Northern Russia. His heir was his second and only surviving son Prince Frederick Alfred who renounced the succession, being a monk in 1953, allowing it to pass to his uncle Bernhard. Marriage and children\nHe was married in Freiburg im Breisgau on 22 February 1919 to Countess Klara Marie von Korff genannt Schmising-Kerssenbrock (Darmstadt, 31 May 1895 - H\u00f6gerhof bei T\u00fcrnitz, Lower Austria, 10 February 1992).

      "According to Steinh\u00fcbel, the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030. In contrast with the Slovak historian, Gy\u00f6rffy writes that this late chronicle \"in which one absurdity follows another\" contradicts all facts known from 11th-century sources. The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Stephen \"led his army against Kean, Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified\" following the occupation of Gyula's country. According to a number of historians, including Zolt\u00e1n Lenkey and G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay, Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003. Other historians, including Gy\u00f6rffy, say that the chronicle's report preserved the memory of Stephen's campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s. Likewise, the identification of the \"Black Hungarians\"\u2014who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Ad\u00e9mar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen's proselytizing policy\u2014is uncertain. Gy\u00f6rffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia. Bruno of Querfurt's report of the Black Hungarians' conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when \"the first mission of Saint Peter\"\u2014a papal legate, Cardinal Azo\u2014arrived in Hungary. The latter attended the meeting in Gy\u0151r where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of P\u00e9cs was issued on 23 August 1009.The Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009. According to Thoroczkay, \"it is very probable\" that the bishopric's establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabars\u2014an ethnic group of Khazar origin\u2014 and their chieftain. The head of the Kabars\u2014who was either Samuel Aba or his father\u2014 married Stephen's unnamed younger sister on this occasion. The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy.",
      "Those who die a sudden death shall be buried with all ecclesiastical honor; for divine judgment is hidden from us and unknown. Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen's suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm \"was most wide and rich\", according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary Annals of Hildesheim adds that Stephen converted his uncle's \"country to the Christian faith by force\" after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period. If the identification, proposed by Krist\u00f3, Gy\u00f6rffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokui\u2014who was Stephen's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburg\u2014is valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, Duke of Poland (r. 992\u20131025). [Duke Boleslav the Brave's] territory included a certain burg, located near the border with the Hungarians. Its guardian was lord Prokui, an uncle of the Hungarian king. Both in the past and more recently, Prokui had been driven from his lands by the king and his wife had been taken captive. When he was unable to free her, his nephew arranged for her unconditional release, even though he was Prokui's enemy. I have never heard of anyone who showed such restraint towards a defeated foe. Because of this, God repeatedly granted him victory, not only in the burg mentioned above, but in others as well. About a hundred years later, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter \"defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube\". Gy\u00f6rffy says that the chronicler's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Morava\u2014a tributary of the Danube\u2014by the Poles in the 1010s. On the other hand, the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century."

      "They had three children, whose son Konrad with full rights to the succession to the house of Saxe-Meiningen:\n\nPrincess Eleonore Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (9 November 1950) she married Peter Eric Rosden on 22 October 1982.

They have two children:\nMarie Cecilie von Braunschweig (4 August 1994) Julius-Alexander von Braunschweig (20 October 1996) Ancestry\nPassage 7:\nPrincess Marie Elisabeth of Saxe-Meiningen\nPrincess Marie Elisabeth of Saxe-Meiningen (23 September 1853 \u2013 22 February 1923) was the only daughter of Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, by his first wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia. She was notable as a musician and composer. One of her most famous works is Romanze in F major for clarinet and piano. Early life\nPrincess Marie Elisabeth was born on 23 September 1853 in Potsdam. She was the third child and only daughter of Georg, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, by his first wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, and had one surviving brother, Hereditary Prince Bernhard. Her parents' marriage was very happy, as it was the rare instance of a love match rather than a marriage of state. In 1855, tragedy struck with the death of their younger infant brother; Charlotte died three months later of complications after childbirth of a baby son, two months earlier. This youngest brother died, one day old. Georg was inconsolable, but remarried several years later to Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg in order to provide a mother for his remaining young children. Marie Elisabeth's father succeeded as Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen in 1866. His second marriage was unhappy; it produced three younger brothers (Ernst, Friedrich, and Viktor) for Marie Elisabeth before Feodora's death in 1872.Marie Elisabeth's father participated in the Franco-Prussian War, where he fought in nearly every battle. After the war, Georg II devoted himself to the stage, and his court became famous for its brilliance and culture.",
      "From 1873 he again served in the military and rose into the highest echelons: By 1905 he was Generaloberst and inspector general of the 2nd Army Inspection (Central Germany). In 1909, he became Generaloberst im Range eines Generalfeldmarschalls and retired from active service in 1912. He married in Berlin on 18 February 1878 Princess Charlotte of Prussia, his second cousin, daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor and granddaughter of the Queen Victoria. They had one daughter: Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (b. Potsdam, 12 May 1879 - d. Schlo\u00df Neuhoff, 26 August 1945), married on 24 September 1898 to Heinrich XXX of Reuss-K\u00f6stritz. Reign\nBernhard assumed the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen after the death of his father in 1914. With the start of World War I Bernhard hoped to be assigned command over an army but was disappointed. In reaction he also withdrew from his role in the Duchy's government. After Germany lost the war, the German revolution forced Bernhard to abdicate as duke on 10 November 1918. Like all the German princes he lost his title and state. He spent the rest of his life in his former country as a private citizen. Bernhard died on 16 January 1928 in Meiningen. He is buried next to his wife in the park at Altenstein. Interests\nDespite his military career he also took a great interest in the arts. He was active as a composer, poet and translator. He was known in particular as an expert on Modern Greek and was renowned for translating German literature into Greek. For his historical studies, for which he repeatedly travelled to Greece and Asia Minor, the University of Breslau awarded him an honorary doctorate.

      "Passage 1:\nDance with a Stranger\nDance with a Stranger  is a 1985 British film directed by Mike Newell. Telling the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain (1955), the film won critical acclaim, and aided the careers of two of its leading actors, Miranda Richardson and Rupert Everett. The screenplay was by Shelagh Delaney, author of A Taste of Honey, and was her third major screenplay. The story of Ellis has resonance in Britain because it provided part of the background to the extended national debates that led to the progressive abolition of capital punishment from 1965. The theme song \"Would You Dance with a Stranger?\" was performed by Mari Wilson and was released as a single. Plot\nA former nude model and prostitute, Ruth is manageress of a drinking club in London that has racing drivers as its main clients. Ruth lives in a flat above the bar with her illegitimate son Andy. Another child is in the custody of her estranged husband's family. In the club, she meets David, an immature, young man from a well-off family who wants to succeed in motor racing but suffers from lack of money and overuse of alcohol. Ruth falls for his looks and charm, but it is a doomed relationship. Without a job, he cannot afford to marry her, and his family would never accept her. When he makes a drunken scene in the club, she is discharged from her job, which means that she is made homeless. Desmond, a wealthy admirer, secures a flat for her and her son, but she still sees David. When she tells him she is pregnant, he does nothing about it, and she miscarries. Distraught, she goes to a house in Hampstead where she believes David is at a party. He comes out and goes with a girl to a pub. Ruth waits outside the pub, and when he emerges, she shoots him dead with four shots. She is arrested, tried and hanged.

      "Track listing\nReception\nBox office\nSmokey and the Bandit II grossed $10,883,835 in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It also set a record for an opening week, with a gross of $18,108,031. It was the eighth-most-popular 1980 film at the United States and Canada box office earning $66,132,626. This box office income inspired a third film. Critical response\nThe film received almost completely negative reviews from critics who felt that it suffered badly in comparison to the original. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from seven critics. Roger Ebert gave it a one out of four stars and stated that there was \"[in 1980] no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels, but it's especially true of Smokey and the Bandit II, which is basically just the original movie done again, not as well ... how can I say it's lazy when it has 50 trucks doing stunts in it? Because it takes a lot less thought to fill up a movie with stunts than to create a comedy that's genuinely funny\". Burt Reynolds later said that he did not enjoy working on the film at all, feeling that it was an unnecessary sequel put together by Universal purely for money-making reasons rather than to try making a good picture. Sequel\nThe film was followed by another sequel three years later, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983), in which Reynolds only made a brief cameo appearance, and Sally Field did not appear. Passage 6:\nThe Nun and the Bandit\nThe Nun and the Bandit is an Australian film directed by Paul Cox. Plot summary\nIn the 1940s, two outlaw brothers kidnap their wealthy 14-year-old second cousin, but things get complicated when her chaperoning nun refuses to abandon her charge. Production\nThe film was made with finance from Film Victoria and the FFC. It was shot near Bacchus Marsh, Maldon in Victoria. Release\nAccording to Ozmovies: Roadshow was the nominal domestic distributor but refused to release it. The film went straight to video, though it had a small theatrical release in Canada thanks to Alliance.",
      "In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team. Passage 2:\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3 is a 1983 American action comedy film and a second and final sequel to Smokey and the Bandit (1977) and Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), starring Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Paul Williams, Pat McCormick, Mike Henry and Colleen Camp. The film also includes a cameo near the end by the original Bandit, Burt Reynolds. With one of the main titular characters missing, the plot of the film revolves instead around Sheriff Buford T. Justice (\"Smokey\"), with the presence of the Bandit merely being suggested through him being impersonated by Cledus (\"Snowman\"). The film received negative reviews and was a box office bomb. Plot\nBig Enos and Little Enos offer retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice a wager, betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from Florida to Texas. Buford rejects the wager and retires, but goes through all sorts of mishaps before finally realizing retirement is not all it is cracked up to be and accepting the Enoses' wager. Buford picks up the fish and starts driving with his son, Junior. The Enoses set many traps, but Buford dodges all of them, so they try to hire the Bandit to intercept him. Agreeing that the original Bandit is too hard to manage, they hire the Snowman to act as the Bandit. The new Snowman/Bandit parks his truck so he can drive a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am. The Bandit picks up Dusty, who quits her job at a used car dealership. The Bandit catches up with Buford and steals the fish with Dusty's help. Buford pursues the Bandit, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Both police cars are disabled in the chase. Buford catches up after the Bandit and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to eat. The chase then creates mass chaos in a local town. The Bandit escapes when an 18-wheeler blocks the alleyway where the Bandit sped through."

      "Shooting had to be halted several times because there was snow on the sands. Other shots occurred at Birkdale beach near Southport, Lancashire.

The name refers to cigarettes, such as the Craven A brand, which had a cork tip. Phil Silvers was paid a great deal more than any other cast member, which provoked animosity among the regular Carry On team. Silvers also could not, or would not, learn his lines, so boards were placed behind the camera so he could read them as shooting was taking place. Despite Talbot Rothwell writing in January 1967 that the part \"simply yells for Phil Silvers all the way along. I just can't get this Bilko image out of my mind\", the central role of the fast-talking Foreign Legion Sergeant had originally been earmarked for Sid James. However, with a commitment to the ITV sitcom George and the Dragon, James's part was recast. The song used by Bo and the others to trick Abdul into thinking there are reinforcements coming is \"Durch die gr\u00fcne Heide\", a marching song used by the German Army during World War II."

    "documentation": [
      "The more extreme elements of this right-wing faction, primarily in the upper echelons of the CUP-dominated government, would go on to commit atrocities against the Armenians. Despite his preference that the country stayed out of further conflict, Mehmed V's most significant political act was to formally declare jihad against the Entente Powers (Allies of World War I) on 14 November 1914, following the Ottoman government's decision to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. He was actually said to look with disfavour on the pro-German policy of Enver Pasha, but could do little to prevent war due to the sultanate's diminished influence since the overthrow of Abd\u00fclhamid II in 1909. This was the last genuine proclamation of jihad in history by a Caliph, as the Caliphate was abolished in 1924. As a direct result of the declaration of war, the British annexed Cyprus, while the Khedivate of Egypt proclaimed its independence and was turned into a British protectorate; these provinces had at least been under nominal Ottoman rule. The proclamation had no noticeable effect on the war, despite the fact that many Muslims lived in Ottoman territories. Some Arabs eventually joined the British forces against the Ottoman Empire with the Arab Revolt in 1916. Mehmed V hosted Kaiser Wilhelm II, his World War I ally, in Constantinople on 15 October 1917. He was made Generalfeldmarschall of the Kingdom of Prussia on 27 January 1916, and of the German Empire on 1 February 1916. He was also made Generalfeldmarschall of Austria-Hungary on 19 May 1918. Death\nMehmed V died at Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace on 3 July 1918 at the age of 73, only four months before the end of World War I. Thus, he did not live to see the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. He spent most of his life at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace in Istanbul. His grave is in the Ey\u00fcp district of modern Istanbul.

      "Eastern Thrace was retaken in the Second Balkan War. The Ottomans entered World War I in November 1914 during which Mehmed declared a jihad against the Allies. During the war the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Christian minorities. While Ottoman forces successfully fended off an Allied invasion at Gallipoli, defeat loomed on the Caucasian and Mesopotamian fronts. Military collapse in the field and a revolt by its Arab subjects would ultimately lead to the Empire's end. Early life\nPrince Re\u015fad was born on 2 November 1844 at the \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace, Istanbul. His father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, and his mother was G\u00fclcemal Kad\u0131n. He had three elder sisters, Fatma Sultan, Refia Sultan and Hatice Sultan (Refia Sultan's twin sister, died as newborn). After his mother's death in 1851, he and his sisters were entrusted in the care of his father's senior consort Servetseza Kad\u0131n. She had asked Abdulmejid to take the motherless children under her wing, and raise as her own, and carried out the duties of a mother who cares for her children with compassion and concern. In 1856, aged twelve, he was ceremoniously circumcised together with his younger half-brothers, \u015eehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin, \u015eehzade Mehmed Burhaneddin, and \u015eehzade Ahmed Nureddin. Mehmed received his education at the palace. Halid Ziya, the chief clerk of the Chamberlain's office between 1909 and 1912, described this as being a poor one. Thanks to his comparatively high intelligence, however, he made good use of the education he had and used it to go further. He studied Arabic and Persian, and spoke the latter very well. He took piano lessons from an Italian pianist and calligraphy lessons from a famous Ottoman calligrapher, Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi (1801\u20131876), who designed the giant pendant medallions of the Hagia Sophia. Reign\nHis reign began at the conclusion of the 31 March Incident on 27 April 1909, but he was largely a figurehead with no real political power, as a consequence of the demonstration of the CUP's power in the 31 March Incident and the Young Turk Revolution (which restored the Ottoman Constitution and Parliament)."

Cleveland Morgan was the great nephew of Henry Morgan, founder of  Morgan\u2019s Department stores, which were sold to the Hudson's Bay Company in the early sixties. At age 18, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He received an M.A. degree in zoology from McGill University in 1904 and then entered the family business Henry Morgan and Company till 1952 when he retired. There, as Vice-President, he was responsible for display, special events and the art and antique departments. Persistent eye problems (he had lost an eye in an accident when he was seven) led to his dedicating his life to building the decorative arts collection that defines the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. He was made the first curator of Decorative Arts at the Art Association of Montreal, now the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and held the position from 1916 until his death in 1962. Under his direction, the collection amassed more than 70,000 works (around 150 every year.) Among his acquisitions were the first Inuit artworks acquired by the Museum; he made these acquisitions in 1953.Denys Sutton of the Apollo magazine believed Morgan was one of the most perceptive connoisseurs of his day in North America. Morgan's \"outstanding judgement of quality and discernment\" is reflected in the objects he gave (896 in his own name, 262 from his family ),, talked family and friends into purchasing and donating or purchased for the collection.",

Hugh Willoughby's father died on 12 June 1715, aged 34, and the infant Hugh Willoughby became the 15th Baron Willoughby of Parham.

The school was governed by local non-conformists. Hugh Willoughby in his early years attended the Rivington Unitarian Chapel. In this period Rivington Grammar school was having difficulty finding a non-conformist headmaster and it is believed this led to Hugh Willoughby being transferred to a Non-conformist school at Taunton, Somerset where he met a lifelong friend Israel Mauduit, the political pamphleteer. In 1732 he received the freedom of Dumfries in Scotland.",

      "Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life.

It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen.

      "B) The Snowman's expertise in driving the truck with the illegal cargo",

      "D) The Bandit's ability to evade the police by using the truck as a decoy"

    "documentation": [
      "They quickly escape in one of Big Enos's 13 Cadillacs as police flood the racetrack. After passing Buford's badly damaged cruiser on the roadside, Bandit gets on the CB and initially directs him to the Burdettes, but then respectfully gives his real location\u2014right behind Buford, who continues his chase leaving Junior behind, and with more parts falling off his cruiser as he limps off after Bandit.

Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, being better known in the film industry as a stuntman. He obtained the attention of studios and aimed the film at a more mainstream release after his friend Reynolds read the script and agreed to portray the Bandit, with Reed now portraying the Bandit's friend the Snowman. Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3, in which Reynolds only appeared in a cameo near the end. At the time, Reynolds was the top box office star in the world.",
      "They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a truck rodeo at Lakewood Fairgrounds and offer him $80,000 to haul 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time) to Atlanta in 28 hours. The Bandit takes the bet on the risky and unprecedented task, and recruits his brother-in-law Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am bought in advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo. The pair arrive in Texarkana one hour early and load up the truck, but just as they head back, Carrie, a runaway bride, intercepts Bandit and jumps in his car, unwittingly making him an indirect target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a career Texas lawman whose witless son Junior was to have married Carrie. Buford, with Junior along, engages in a high-speed pursuit and doggedly chases Bandit all the way to Georgia to retrieve Carrie and arrest the Bandit, while various comical mishaps cause his cruiser to disintegrate on the way. Bandit attracts more police attention across Dixie as Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped en route by many colorful characters via CB radio. Neither Buford nor any other lawmen know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Buford is chasing him because of Carrie, whose jumpiness inspires Bandit to give her the CB handle \"Frog\". Just after re-entering Georgia, Snowman is rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a Georgia State Patrol motorcycle trooper, as state and local police intensely pursue Bandit with roadblocks and a helicopter to track his movement. With four miles left, Bandit, discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, is ready to give up, but Snowman, who initially thought they would fail, takes the lead and smashes through the roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance. They return with ten minutes remaining on their time limit, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a double-or-nothing offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to Boston and bring back clam chowder in 18 hours."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "His nine years of despotic and dissolute rule are best known for having provoked numerous foreign interventions, including blockades and bombardments by Dutch, British, German, and Italian naval units seeking to enforce the claims of their citizens against Castro's government. Crisis of 1901\u20131903\nIn 1901 the banker Manuel Antonio Matos was the leader of the Liberating Revolution, a major military movement with the intention to overthrow Cipriano Castro's government. Severe disagreements between Castro and the foreign economic elite that support the revolution (as New York and Bermudez Company, Orinoco Shipping Company, Krupp, French Cable, and others) evolved into an open war that shook the country and brought the government to the brink of collapse. On 2 April 1902, in response to rising political tension between the Netherlands and Venezuela to evacuate the Jews of Coro to Cura\u00e7ao, the HNLMS Koningin Regentes and the HNLMS Utrecht arrived in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira. Prior to their arrival, the Venezuelan Navy had repeatedly checked Dutch and Antillean merchant ships and the presence of the Dutch warships acted as a deterrent against further actions. In November 1902, the troops at command of Castro himself broke the Siege of La Victoria, weakened the vast network of revolutionaries armies and its extraordinary power. Few weeks after that, Venezuela saw a naval blockade of several months imposed by Britain, Germany and Italy over Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in the recent Liberating Revolution. Castro assumed that the Monroe Doctrine would see the United States prevent European military intervention, but at the time the government of president Theodore Roosevelt saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. With prior promises that no such seizure would occur, the US allowed the action to go ahead without objection. The blockade saw Venezuela's small navy quickly disabled, but Castro refused to give in, and instead agreed in principle to submit some of the claims to international arbitration, which he had previously rejected.",
      "The Dutch warships had orders to intercept every ship that was sailing under the Venezuelan flag. On 12 December 1908, the Gelderland captured the Venezuelan gunboat Alix off Puerto Cabello. She and another ship the 23 de Mayo were interned in the harbor of Willemstad. With their overwhelming naval superiority, the Dutch enforced a blockade on Venezuela's ports. Castro's overthrow in 1908, exile and death in 1924\nFew days later, Castro, who had been seriously ill for four years due to a kidney problem, left for Paris to seek medical treatment for syphilis, leaving the government in the hands of vice president Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, the man who was instrumental in his victories of 1899 and 1903. However, on 19 December 1908, G\u00f3mez seized power himself and effectively ended the war with the Netherlands. A few days later, General Castro left for Berlin, nominally for a surgical operation. After that Castro suffered the harassment of the European powers resentful due to the policy that he had maintained towards them during his 8 years as president of Venezuela. Without resources to carry out an armed invasion, he went to Madrid and then recovered from his operation in Paris and in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. At the end of 1912 Castro intended to spend a season in the United States, but was captured and vexed by the immigration authorities of Ellis Island which forced him to leave in peremptory terms (February, 1913). He finally settled with his wife in Puerto Rico (1916), under close surveillance by spies sent by Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, who assumed the Venezuelan presidency. Castro spent the rest of his life in exile in Puerto Rico, making several plots to return to power \u2014 none of which were successful. Castro died 4 December 1924, in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Cipriano Castro cabinet (1899\u20131908)\nPersonal life\nCastro was married to Zoila Rosa Mart\u00ednez, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1899 to 1908. Castro's daughter was the actress of Hollywood silent movies Rosa Castro Mart\u00ednez who adopted the name stage as Lucille Mendez She was married to the film director  Ralph Ince."

      "In a contrasting report, Stephen's Greater Legend states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Modern historians\u2014including P\u00e1l Engel, and Mikl\u00f3s Moln\u00e1r\u2014write that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his First Book of Laws that he governed his realm \"by the will of God\". The exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown. According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones. Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty. For instance, his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS (\"the king's spear\") and depict an arm holding a spear with flag. According to the contemporaneous Ad\u00e9mar de Chabannes, a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of G\u00e9za's right to \"enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country\". Stephen is styled in various ways\u2014Ungarorum rex (\"king of the Hungarians\"), Pannoniorum rex (\"king of the Pannonians\") or Hungarie rex (\"king of Hungary\")\u2014in his charters. Consolidation (1001\u2013c. 1009) Although Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation, the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm \"by the Grace of God\".",
      "Those who die a sudden death shall be buried with all ecclesiastical honor; for divine judgment is hidden from us and unknown. Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen's suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm \"was most wide and rich\", according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary Annals of Hildesheim adds that Stephen converted his uncle's \"country to the Christian faith by force\" after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period. If the identification, proposed by Krist\u00f3, Gy\u00f6rffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokui\u2014who was Stephen's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburg\u2014is valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, Duke of Poland (r. 992\u20131025). [Duke Boleslav the Brave's] territory included a certain burg, located near the border with the Hungarians. Its guardian was lord Prokui, an uncle of the Hungarian king. Both in the past and more recently, Prokui had been driven from his lands by the king and his wife had been taken captive. When he was unable to free her, his nephew arranged for her unconditional release, even though he was Prokui's enemy. I have never heard of anyone who showed such restraint towards a defeated foe. Because of this, God repeatedly granted him victory, not only in the burg mentioned above, but in others as well. About a hundred years later, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter \"defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube\". Gy\u00f6rffy says that the chronicler's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Morava\u2014a tributary of the Danube\u2014by the Poles in the 1010s. On the other hand, the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century."

      "B) Barbour was the first person to serve as both Speaker of the House and an associate justice of the Supreme Court.",

      "D) Barbour was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Jackson in 1835 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Gabriel Duvall."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "State judge and second term in Congress\nBarbour declined to run for re-election in 1824 and turned down an offer from Thomas Jefferson to become the professor of law in the University of Virginia in 1825. Instead, he accepted election by Virginia legislature as a judge of the General Court of Virginia succeeding the late Hugh Holmes. Barbour served for two years as a state judge. In 1827, Barbour returned to his seat in the House of Representatives as a Jacksonian. For the first two years of his second stint in the House, he was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In 1829, Barbour became one of the first Jeffersonian Old Republicans to join the Jacksonian Democrats in opposition to the National Bank. He fought to expose the Second Bank of the United States as a private enterprise, endowed with federal funds while only masquerading as a government institution. Although his anti-Bank campaign did not take hold, Barbour's advocacy for state sovereignty, the removal of the National Bank, and the legalization of slavery in territories such as Missouri earned him favor with President Andrew Jackson. Also in 1829, while continuing to serve as a U.S. Representative, Barbour became a delegate for the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, and the Convention elected him their second president, after the Convention's first president, James Monroe, had to withdraw due to failing health on December 8. As such, Barbour (with distinguished Virginians such as Monroe, James Madison, and John Marshall) helped restrict discussion of slavery's role in the Commonwealth, and limited the rancorous assembly's debates to issues of representation and suffrage (Virginia had been one of the last states to allow only landowners to vote, and slaveholders had disproportionate power). The resulting constitution was adopted in 1830, despite the votes against it from the state's northern and western areas (much of which ultimately split off to become West Virginia during the American Civil War decades after Barbour's death).",
      "Passage 1:\nPhilip Pendleton Barbour\nPhilip Pendleton Barbour (May 25, 1783 \u2013 February 25, 1841) was the tenth speaker of the United States House of Representatives and an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He is the only individual to serve in both positions. He was also a slave owner. Born in Gordonsville, Virginia, Barbour established a legal career in Gordonsville after studying at the College of William & Mary. Several members of Barbour's family, including his brother, James Barbour, went on to hold prominent political office. Barbour won election to the House of Representatives in 1814 as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He served a single term as Speaker from 1821 to 1823 and declined to seek re-election to Congress in 1824. Barbour returned to Congress in 1827 as an ally of Andrew Jackson. Barbour served in Congress until 1830, when he accepted appointment as a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. President Jackson appointed Barbour to the Supreme Court in 1835 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation in 1835 of Gabriel Duvall. Barbour served on the Court until his death in 1841. On the Court, Barbour generally supported Jacksonian principles and states' rights. Early and family life\nBarbour was born near Gordonsville, Orange County, Virginia, as the son of a planter, Thomas Barbour, who was a legislator, neighbor and early political sponsor of James Madison. He was named for his ancestor Philip Pendleton, through whom he was related to Edmund Pendleton, a politician and judge. The family was one of the First Families of Virginia, descended from a Scottish merchant who married a Miss Taliaferro and made his home in nearby Culpeper County, Virginia. Like his brother James Barbour, Philip attended common and private schools before beginning formal legal studies under jurist St. George Tucker in Williamsburg, Virginia, but financial circumstances forced Tucker to end this arrangement in 1799. He soon moved to Kentucky to make his fortune, where after a year reading law, he was admitted to the bar, and began practicing law in Bardstown."

Yates (September 16, 1918 \u2013 June 2, 2006) was an American television director who was the director of the ABC television program American Bandstand from 1952 until 1969. Biography\nYates became a still photographer after graduating from high school in 1936. After serving in World War II, he became employed by Philadelphia's WFIL-TV as a boom microphone operator. He was later promoted to cameraman (important as most programming was done live and local during the early years of television) and earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1950 from the University of Pennsylvania. In October 1952, Yates volunteered to direct Bandstand, a new concept featuring local teens dancing to the latest hits patterned after the \"950 Club\" on WPEN-AM. The show debuted with Bob Horn as host and took off after Dick Clark, already a radio veteran at age 26, took over in 1956. It was broadcast live in its early years, even after it became part of the ABC network's weekday afternoon lineup in 1957 as American Bandstand. Yates pulled records, directed the cameras, queued the commercials and communicated with Clark via a private line telephone located on his podium. In 1964, Clark moved the show to Los Angeles, taking Yates with him. Yates retired from American Bandstand in 1969, and moved his family to the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester. He died in 2006 at a nursing home where he had been for the last two months of his life.",

      "He said: \"I don't have goals when I make a film, except to create as faithfully as possible the story I wanted to tell, and that the sensations that provoked me to tell the story are also caused when reading the script.\"\"I don't love film in itself; it's not like I was debating the merits of using different types of camera-work, like traveling shots. I love film because it's a story-telling tool,\" he said in an interview he did for TimesSquare.com. Interconnections between films\nIt is arguable that the loose trilogy of films \u2014 Esperando al Mes\u00edas (2000), El Abrazo Partido (2003), and Derecho de Familia (2006) \u2014 happen in the same \"universe\". The three share common traits: They are written and directed by Burman and all star Daniel Hendler in the title role as a young Jew. Additionally, several actors and actresses appear twice in the films. Because Hendler's characters share similar traits (they are all named Ariel: Ariel Goldstein, Ariel Makaroff and Ariel Perelman respectively) and because some characters from one film seem to appear in another, the trilogy is usually considered as happening in the same universe\nSeveral continuity changes show that the three Ariels are different people: In the first movie, Ariel's father is a restaurant owner, and his mother dies; in the second film, his father has been long gone, and his mother tends to a small shop; in the third movie, his father dies in the film, and his mother has been long dead. However, a character named Estela from the first film appears in the second, and is both times played by Melina Petriella. This at least connects the first two movies to the same universe. Additionally, Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores Quispe appears in the second and third movie as \"Ram\u00f3n\". Although his character, unlike Estela, varies from film to film, this suggests that the second and third film also share the same universe and, thus, the trilogy itself is set in the same storyline, with the \"Ariel persona\" showing either different aspects of the same character or simply being a mere coincidence.",
      "Passage 1:\nMi novia el... Mi novia el... (My Girlfriend the...) is a 1975 Argentine comedy film. The original title, Mi novia el travesti (\"My Girlfriend the Transvestite\") was edited by Argentine censors when the film was first released. The original script was about a real travesti supposed to be protagonized by Jorge Perez, a famous travesti under the name of Jorge Perez Evelyn. However, the censorship was so strong that the script was changed and Perez was replaced with actress Susana Gim\u00e9nez. The plot is based on the 1933 German film Victor and Victoria. Plot\nAlberto is a regular middle-aged man who lives with his elder mother and works at a factory. After a night out where he attends a show by transvestite artist Dominique, he develops an unexpected fixation with the artist. What started out as a loud reaction of disgust and bigotry, slowly turns into him realizing that he is in fact attracted to Dominique. This newfound interest fills Alberto's mind with guilt and doubt, while his coworkers start mocking him for dating a \"weirdo\", and his family grieve his lost decency.

      "\"\nPassage 7:\nK. Balachander\nKailasam Balachander (9 July 1930 \u2013 23 December 2014) was an Indian filmmaker and playwright who worked mainly in the Tamil cinema. He was well known for his distinct film-making style, and the Indian film industry knew him as a master of unconventional themes and hard-hitting contemporary subject matter. Balachander's films are well known for their portrayal of women as bold personalities and central characters. Popularly referred to as Iyakkunar Sigaram (lit. \"Director Paramount\"), his films are usually centred on unusual or complicated interpersonal relationships and social themes. He started his film career in 1964 as a screenwriter and graduated to a director with Neerkumizhi (1965). In a career that spanned 50 years, he had contributed to nearly 100 feature films either as a screenwriter or director, thus becoming one of the most prolific filmmakers in the country. Known among his colleagues as a tough task master, he was credited with having nurtured numerous actors, notably Nagesh, Sujatha, Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Chiranjeevi, Jaya Prada, Sridevi, Jayasudha, Saritha, Renuka, Nassar, Prakash Raj, Ramesh Aravind and Vivek. In his film career, Balachander had won nine National Film Awards and 13 Filmfare Awards. He was honored with the Padma Shri (1987), India's fourth highest civilian award, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema. He also made films under his production house, Kavithalaya Productions. Apart from Tamil, he made films in other languages such as Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Towards the tail end of his career, he directed a few TV serials and made a few film appearances as well. Early life and background\nK. Balachander was born in Tamil Brahmin family in 1930  at Nannilam in the Tanjore district (now Tiruvarur district), India. Balachander stated that, \"From my eighth year I've been seeing cinema\" and recalls that his earliest interest towards cinema grew after watching films of M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, then the Superstar of Tamil cinema."

      "D) Schubert's final illness was a combination of syphilis and another condition, as suggested by the presence of both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Schubert expressed the wish, were he to survive his final illness, to further develop his knowledge of harmony and counterpoint, and had actually made appointments for lessons with the counterpoint master Simon Sechter. On 26 March 1828, the anniversary of Beethoven's death, Schubert gave, for the only time in his career, a public concert of his own works. The concert was a success popularly and financially, even though it would be overshadowed by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's first appearances in Vienna shortly after. Final illness and death\nIn the midst of this creative activity, his health deteriorated. By the late 1820s, Schubert's health was failing and he confided to some friends that he feared that he was near death. In the late summer of 1828, he saw the physician Ernst Rinna, who may have confirmed Schubert's suspicions that he was ill beyond cure and likely to die soon. Some of his symptoms matched those of mercury poisoning (mercury was then a common treatment for syphilis, again suggesting that Schubert suffered from it). At the beginning of November, he again fell ill, experiencing headaches, fever, swollen joints, and vomiting. He was generally unable to retain solid food and his condition worsened. Five days before Schubert's death, his friend the violinist Karl Holz and his string quartet visited to play for him. The last musical work he had wished to hear was Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 131; Holz commented: \"The King of Harmony has sent the King of Song a friendly bidding to the crossing\". Schubert died in Vienna, aged 31, on 19 November 1828, at the apartment of his brother Ferdinand. The cause of his death was officially diagnosed as typhoid fever, though other theories have been proposed, including the tertiary stage of syphilis. Although there are accounts by his friends that indirectly imply that he was syphilitic, the symptoms of his final illness do not correspond with tertiary syphilis. Six weeks before his death, he walked 42 miles in three days, ruling out musculoskeletal syphilis.",
      "In the month of his death, he composed his last work, \"Der Hirt Auf Den Felsen\", making neurosyphilis unlikely. Finally, meningo-vascular syphilis is unlikely because it presents a progressive stroke-like picture, and Schubert had no neurological manifestation until his final delirium, which started only two days before his death. This, and the fact that his final illness was characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms (namely vomiting), led Robert L. Rold to argue that his final illness was a gastrointestinal one, like salmonella or indeed typhus. Eva M. Cybulska goes further and says that Schubert's syphilis is a conjecture. His multi-system signs and symptoms, she says, could point at a number of different illness such as leukaemia, anaemia, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and that many tell-tale signs of syphilis \u2014 chancre, mucous plaques, rash on the thorax, pupil abnormality, dysgraphia \u2014 were absent. She argues that the syphilis diagnosis originated with Schubert's biographer Otto Deutsch in 1907, based on the aforementioned indirect references by his friends, and uncritically repeated ever since. It was near the grave of Beethoven, whom he had admired all his life, that Schubert was buried at his own request, in the village cemetery of W\u00e4hring on the edge of the Vienna Woods. A year earlier he had served as a torchbearer at Beethoven's funeral. In 1872, a memorial to Franz Schubert was erected in Vienna's Stadtpark. In 1888, both Schubert's and Beethoven's graves were moved to the Zentralfriedhof where they can now be found next to those of Johann Strauss II and Johannes Brahms. Anton Bruckner was present at both exhumations, and he reached into both coffins and held the revered skulls in his hands. The cemetery in W\u00e4hring was converted into a park in 1925, called the Schubert Park, and his former grave site was marked by a bust. His epitaph, written by his friend, the poet Franz Grillparzer, reads: Die Tonkunst begrub hier einen reichen Besitz, aber noch viel sch\u00f6nere Hoffnungen (\"The art of music has here interred a precious treasure, but yet far fairer hopes\")."

      "In the 21st century, France has had less success, only making the top ten three times, with Natasha St-Pier finishing fourth in 2001, Sandrine Fran\u00e7ois finishing fifth in 2002 and Patricia Kaas finishing eighth in 2009. In 2012, the nation finished in twenty-second place with the song \"Echo (You and I)\" performed by Anggun. The French national broadcaster, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, broadcasts the event within France and delegates the selection of the nation's entry to the television channel France 3. France 3 confirmed that France would participate in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest on 6 November 2012. The French broadcaster had used both national finals and internal selection to choose the French entry in the past. From 2008 to 2012, the broadcaster opted to internally select the French entry, a procedure that was continued in order to select the 2013 entry. Before Eurovision\nInternal selection\nFrance 3 announced in late 2012 that the French entry for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest would be selected internally. The organisation of the internal selection was headed by the newly appointed French Head of Delegation for the Eurovision Song Contest Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Valencak. The French broadcaster requested proposals from record companies, music publishers, artist managers and artists themselves and shortlisted 18 entries from the received submissions to advance to the next stage, which involved a fourteen-member selection committee consisting of representatives of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and music industry professionals.

The song was written by Boris Bergman and David Salkin. The selection committee considered five entries following a blind audio listening before finalising their decision internally in early 2013. The entry was released on 13 March 2013 via the streaming service Spotify, and was formally presented to the public on 14 March 2013 during the France 5 programme C \u00e0 vous, hosted by Alessandra Sublet.",

It was originally released on Aznavour's highly successful 1994 CD, aptly titled Toi et Moi. In 1995, the English version titled You and Me, as well as the Spanish version T\u00fa y Yo were released. In 2018 Charles Aznavour sang new version duo with russian singer Polina Gagarina. Passage 2:\nL'enfer et moi\nFrance participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 with the song \"L'enfer et moi\" written by Boris Bergman and David Salkin. The song was performed by Amandine Bourgeois. The French broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions in collaboration with the television channel France 3 internally selected the French entry for the 2013 contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. \"L'enfer et moi\" was officially announced by France 3 as the French entry on 22 January 2013 and later the song was presented to the public as the contest entry on 13 March 2013.

France first won the contest in 1958 with \"Dors, mon amour\" performed by Andr\u00e9 Claveau. In the 1960s, they won three times, with \"Tom Pillibi\" performed by Jacqueline Boyer in 1960, \"Un premier amour\" performed by Isabelle Aubret in 1962 and \"Un jour, un enfant\" performed by Frida Boccara, who won in 1969 in a four-way tie with the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. France's fifth victory came in 1977, when Marie Myriam won with the song \"L'oiseau et l'enfant\". France have also finished second four times, with Paule Desjardins in 1957, Catherine Ferry in 1976, Jo\u00eblle Ursull in 1990 and Amina in 1991, who lost out to Sweden's Carola in a tie-break."

      "He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out. He did, however, oppose the French dominance of the local government, and other policies, and for his critique he was eventually arrested by orders from Louis-Nicolas Davout and imprisoned in the fortress of Gifhorn. In the same year, he lost his first wife. In the summer of 1809 Louis was appointed sub-prefect of Salzwedel, where three years later in 1812 he married Karoline Heubel; they had three children. After Salzwedel was again under Prussian administration, in 1816 Ludwig von Westphalen was transferred to the newly established regional government in Trier. Personal life\nIt was in Trier that he met and befriended Heinrich Marx, the father of Karl Marx. The children of the respective families, in particular Jenny and Edgar von Westphalen, and Sophie and Karl Marx, became close friends as well. In 1836, Jenny von Westphalen and Karl Marx became engaged; at first secretly but Ludwig approved the marriage in 1837, even though some saw Marx, who was both middle class and younger than her, as well as of Jewish descent, as an inappropriate partner for the noble daughter. In fact, Ludwig was seen as the mentor and role model of Karl Marx, who referred to him as a \"dear fatherly friend\". Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life. Marx also read Voltaire and Racine with Ludwig. Ludwig devoted much of his time to the young Marx and the two went for intellectual walks through \"the hills and woods\" of the neighbourhood. It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen.",
      "He studied at the Collegium Carolinum, the forerunner of today's Braunschweig University of Technology, and at G\u00f6ttingen. Career\nIn 1794, he entered government's service in Brunswick. In 1797 he married Elisabeth von Veltheim, who bore him four children. In 1804 he entered the government service of the Duchy of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenb\u00fcttel). With the establishment of the Napoleonic state in Westphalia (the Kingdom of Westphalia) in 1807, he entered its service. He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out.

    "choices": [
      "A) To maintain her physical strength",
      "B) To prevent her from descending into madness",
      "C) To sustain her life after being resurrected",
      "D) To keep her body temperature regulated"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "The story involves a young woman who has returned from the dead and needs human blood in order to survive. Plot\nTwo men break into an old crypt, seeking to dump toxic waste and rob the graves. When an earthquake causes the toxic waste to spill, Catherine Valmont, a young woman who died several years ago, is resurrected. She viciously kills the thieves and drinks their blood. As Catherine walks aimlessly through a field, Barbara spots her and takes a few photos, though Barbara's boyfriend, Greg, takes no notice. Catherine returns to her old house, the Valmont Mansion, and memories of her childhood come back to her, especially her childhood friend, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. As Catherine wanders the house, a real estate agent shows an old couple around the property, though they show little interest. After they leave, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne calls the house, presumably inquiring about it. However, she hears nothing but a cherished music box, leading her to believe that Catherine may still be alive. The agent later returns to the Valmont Mansion, along with her boyfriend. Catherine interrupts them having sex, killing both and drinking their blood. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne arrives and is shocked to discover the dead bodies. When she finds Catherine, naked and playing the piano, she assumes that Catherine didn't really die but was actually hidden for the past two years. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne washes the blood off Catherine, puts her to bed, and drags the bodies down to the crypt, where she discovers the bodies of the grave robbers. Catherine creeps down and begins to drink the blood from one of the bodies, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne stops her. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne cuts her arm and lets Catherine drink her blood, until she can think of a way to supply her friend with blood. Barbara goes around the village asking about the woman in her photograph, but the answer is always the same: It is Catherine Valmont, and she died two years ago. Greg thinks Barbara is making too much of it, and discourages her from investigating further. Meanwhile, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne tries to understand what is happening to Catherine, trying to teach her to speak again.",
      "As three thieves enter the vaults and plan to rob Catherine and her deceased relative of their jewellery as they lay in their coffins, an earth tremor occurs, which suddenly resurrects Catherine. Unaware of her surroundings, she must acquire human victims and drink their blood to prevent her descending into madness and possibly death, with drifting in and out of childhood memories of her childhood friend, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Marina Pierro). During which, a photographer, Barbara (Carina Barone), becomes fascinated by Catherine when she discovers her and thinks she is quite peculiar, and sets out to uncover a mystery. Catherine's childhood friend, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is intending to buy the Valmont mansion, which is currently on the market and a strange phone call leads her to the home where she discovers that Catherine is alive and the bodies of the thieves and the real estate agent and her boyfriend. Trying to convince herself that Catherine did not actually die, she realises that she has returned from the dead and must help her by bringing her unsuspecting victims. Some of the financing for the film was courtesy of Jacques Raif, who co-wrote the feature. The film's photographer Pierre LeBlond, found a castle which would become the Valmont mansion, which they rented. The castle provided accommodation for the cast and crew, in which the owner offered to cook. According to Rollin, the owner insisted on being referred to as \"His Lordship\" and that he was very difficult to get along with  Actress, Fran\u00e7oise Blanchard was introduced to Rollin by Fanny Magier, a co-star actress who appeared in the film. When Blanchard arrived, Rollin was unsure whether to offer her the role of Catherine due to the fact that in the first scene in which her character is resurrected, Blanchard appeared wearing trousers which wasn't required for the scene and Rollin did not ask her to remove them. She did however receive the role due to good contact. Blanchard showed great professionalism in her role and in one particular scene, the final scene of the film, in which Blanchard's character cries and screams after devouring her childhood friend, the crew became concerned over her mental state as they thought she has descended into madness."

      "The language is archaic, and admits multiple readings. The traditional reading takes into account a cryptic statement that Lord Shao was unhappy at court to read Jun Shi as a plea from Lord Shao to remain in his position and help coadminister government affairs until the new king is ready. Shao Gao is then read as an exhortation to the new king to do a good job. An alternative reading pits the two chapters against one another, with Lord Shao highlighting how the Mandate of Heaven flows only to the eldest son, and the Duke of Zhou calling upon a panoply of worthy ministers of yore to support his platform of how crucial capable ministers are to good government, quoting Lord Shao's own words back at him about how the two of them would work together, asserting that heaven's mandate had come jointly to the Zhou as a group, and ending with an impassioned plea where he addresses Lord Shao as his brother. Although the two texts are clearly closely related, which is the response to the other is debated. And whether they are read from a traditional or revisionist viewpoint, regardless of the personal, political, or philosophical motives behind either man's words, soon thereafter the young King Cheng stepped fully into his authority, and the Duke of Zhou disappeared from the political scene for the remainder of his life. Longevity\nLord Shao served four generations of Zhou kings: King Wen, King Wu, King Cheng, and King Kang. He features prominently in the later Shangshu chapter Gu Ming, which describes the inauguration ritual of King Kang. In it, Lord Shao can be seen to command great respect at court. He is listed first in each enumeration of participants, gives orders to other functionaries to help prepare for the proceedings, performs ritual actions rivaled only by the new king and the Master Ritualist, and reads the command of accession to the king. Wang Chong's Lunheng claims that Lord Shao lived over a hundred years, and epigraphic records securely dateable to the middle years of King Kang's reign tend to support rather than refute this claim.",
      "An illegally excavated manuscript version of a chapter of Shangshu, part of the Tsinghua bamboo slips, allows for the reading that the Duke of Zhou had performed a sacrifice to the ancestral spirits to divine whether he was their chosen successor to the ailing King Wu. The traditional reading interprets this passage to indicate the Duke of Zhou offering his life if the king's could be spared. In both readings, this ceremony is suggested by the other two Ducal Ministers. Traditionally, the Duke of Zhou is considered to have assumed regency rather than kingship. In any case, the son of the vanquished Shang king and affiliated groups, possibly aided by Zhou royal brothers, took the opportunity to rebel in an action called the Rebellion of the Three Guards. Lord Shao allied with the Duke of Zhou, and after three years the rebellion was suppressed. Sharing power\nWith the violence quelled, King Wu's son, now three years less young, along with the victorious Lord Shao and Duke of Zhou, entered into a triple alliance, sharing power delicately between them. Lord Shao was given power over the lands to the west of the twin capitals Feng and Hao, on the Wei river in present day Xi'an, Shaanxi. This included his lineage's power base near the predynastic Zhou capital of Xishan; the Duke of Zhou was given control over the lands to the east. It was during this timeframe Lord Shao went to survey the site of the new capital city Luoyi (present day Luoyang, Henan), which would control both the strategic ford which had facilitated the Zhou conquest in the first place, as well as the pass through the mountains to the Zhou homeland. The portents were also auspicious, and Lord Shao had rammed earth city wall constructed in a month's time. Multiple episodes carried by the Shangshu relate to this period of time, and two in particular relate to each other and the power struggle at court. Jun Shi (\u541b\u596d), a piece of persuasive writing from the Duke of Zhou to Lord Shao is one, and the other is Shao Gao (\u53ec\u8aa5), mostly by Lord Shao."

The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France. Plot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away. Commanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes."

      "He was well known for his need for personal privacy and sometimes wore disguises, such as a false moustache at the New York premiere of one of his films. Rohmer's mother died without ever knowing that her son was a famous film director. Rohmer died on the morning of 11 January 2010 at the age of 89 after a series of strokes.: 1345\u200a He had been admitted to hospital the previous week. The former Culture Minister Jack Lang called Rohmer \"one of the masters of French cinema\". Director Thierry Fremaux called his work \"unique\". Rohmer's grave is in district 13 of Montparnasse Cemetery. At the 2010 C\u00e9sar Awards, actor Fabrice Luchini presented a special tribute to Rohmer:\n\nI'm going to read a remarkable text written by Jacques Fieschi, writer, director, creator of \"the cinematographe\", challenger of Les cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, which recently published a special edition on Eric Rohmer. Truffaut once said he was one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, Godard was his brother, Chabrol admired him, Wenders couldn't stop taking photos of him. Rohmer is a tremendous international star. The one and only French director who was in coherence with the money spent on his films and the money that his films made. I remember a phrase by Daniel Toscan Du Plantier the day Les Visiteurs opened, which eventually sold 15 million tickets: \"Yes but there is this incredible film called L'arbre, le maire et la m\u00e9diath\u00e8que that sold 100,000 tickets, which may sound ridiculous in comparison, but no, because but it was only playing in one theater for an entire year.\" A happy time for cinema when this kind of thing could happen. Rohmer. Here is a tribute from Jacques Fieschi: \"We are all connected with the cinema, at least for a short time. The cinema has its economical laws, its artistic laws, a craft that once in a while rewards us or forgets us. \u00c9ric Rohmer seems to have escaped from this reality by inventing his own laws, his own rules of the game. One could say his own economy of the cinema that served his own purpose, which could skip the others, or to be more accurate that couldn't skip the audience with its originality."

      "He picked up a film called The Personals (1983) which enjoyed success. Millennium Films\nCorman sold New World Pictures in January 1983 to a consortium of three lawyers for $16.9 million. Under the terms of the contract, he agreed to stay on as a consultant for two years and to provide New World with at least five films they could release. New World agreed to distribute all of Corman's films until March 1984. He set up a new production company, Millennium \u2013 the title of which was taken from the name of a 1981 retrospective of Corman's work at the National Film Theatre of London. He announced plans to make films budgeted between $2\u20135 million using cash from his sale of New World to finance personally. He announced an intention to make fewer commercial films, movies more like I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and Cries and Whispers. Millennium's films included Space Raiders (1983), a science fiction epic using footage and music from Battle Beyond the Stars; Love Letters (1984), a serious drama from Amy Holden Jones; Screwballs (1984), a sex comedy in the vein of Porky's; Suburbia (1984), directed by Penelope Spheeris, which he acquired, Deathstalker; and Kain of Dark Planet (which became The Warrior and the Sorceress). New Horizons\nCorman says people struggled with the name \"Millennium\" \u2013 \"nobody could spell it, nobody knew what it meant\" \u2013 so he changed it to New Horizons by early 1984.Corman and the new owners of New World ended up suing each other in March 1985. Corman claimed that New World failed to honor their guarantee to distribute his movies at a fee of 15%. He sought $400 million in damages and the return of the company. He said they refused to distribute School Spirit (1985) and Wheels of Fire. He also claimed that New World cheated him distributing Space Raiders, Screwballs and Slumber Party Massacre. New World sued Corman in return, claiming he was seeking to return to distribution, and was discrediting New World to potential investors. They said Corman bypassed New World for some of his films, such as Columbia's Hardbodies (1984).",
      "Ordinary pictures don't make money. \"\n\nThe Wild Angels\nAfter a year of not directing, Corman took a leave of absence under his contract with Columbia to make a film for AIP, the first biker movie, The Wild Angels. It starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra, from a script by Griffith; Peter Bogdanovich worked as Corman's assistant. The film opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival and was hugely successful at the box office, making over $6 million on a $350,000 budget and kicking off the \"biker movie\" cycle. He wanted to make a film about the Red Baron, but Columbia turned it down because of The Blue Max (1966). He proposed a movie about the St Valentine's Day Massacre and also an adaptation of the novel Only Lovers Left Alive. Nick Ray was meant to be making Only Lovers in Britain. Corman did begin directing Long Ride Home with Glenn Ford at Columbia. However, Corman left production a few weeks into the shoot in June 1966 and was replaced by Phil Karlson. The film was retitled A Time for Killing (1967). Corman received an offer to direct a studio film,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967), for 20th Century Fox, starring Jason Robards and George Segal. He did not enjoy the restrictions of working for a major studio. He was given a $2.5 million budget and made it for $400,000 less. Corman, an independent director, was most comfortable in his own style:  shoestring budgets and shooting schedules measured in days, rather than weeks. Nonetheless, it is generally considered one of his best films as a director. Corman was meant to follow this with Robert E. Lee for United Artists at a budget of $4.5 million. It was not made. Neither was a story Corman optioned, The Spy in the Vatican. Return to independence\nHe continued to finance films for Filmgroup: Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965), dubbing a Soviet movie Planeta Bur into English with some additional footage shot by Curtis Harrington, Queen of Blood (1966), using some Soviet footage but a mostly new film, directed by Harrington, Blood Bath (1966), an adapted Yugoslavian film with additional footage shot by Stephanie Rothman and Jack Hill, and  Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1967), yet another dubbed version of Planeta Bur with some additional footage shot by Corman's then-assistant Peter Bogdanovich."

      "However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over \u00d6resund to H\u00e4lsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way.",
      "The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity.

      "Marriage and reign\nWhen Queen Isabella II was deposed in 1868, Mercedes' family left Spain for exile. It was reportedly during that banishment in 1872 that she met her first cousin Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, also living in exile. Isabella II opposed a marriage between the two due to the hostilities between Mercedes' father and the former queen. Upon restoration, King Alfonso married Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes at the church of Atocha in Madrid on 23 January 1878, following a huge ball in December 1877. Allegedly, the King's choice dashed the hopes of his still-exiled mother Queen Isabella for Alfonso's marriage to Infanta Blanca de Borb\u00f3n, daughter of his Carlist rival Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Mercedes helped build a new temple after the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Almudena was demolished in 1868. Death\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on 26 June 1878, at 18 years old. Legacy\nThe news of her demise spawned many folk songs accounting for it, most notably the famous copla, with many variations in Spain and America, particularly popular among children delivered as a song accompanying a skipping rope game. According to Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, he had already heard about it few days after the incident: \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde vas Alfonso XII? \u00bf D\u00f3nde vas triste de ti? Voy en busca de Mercedes que ayer tarde no la vi\u2026\u201d (\"Where are you going, Alfonso XII? Where are you going, sad man?\u2014I'm going in search of Mercedes whom I did not see yesterday afternoon...\"). A film about the romance between Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes and Alfonso XII, Where Are You Going, Alfonso XII?, was released in 1958.Queen Mercedes co-initiated the building of the Cathedral of la Almudena in Madrid, opposite of the royal palace \u2014the construction beginning in 1883. In May 2004 Felipe, Prince of Asturias, was wed there to Letizia Ortiz. Queen Mercedes' remains were re-interred there on 8 November 2000, in accordance with her widower's wishes.",
      "A town in the northern Philippine province of Isabela was named Reina Mercedes in her honor in 1886 when the Spanish colonial government formally separated it from Cauayan. When the King's minister C\u00e1novas del Castillo suggested that he take a new wife, Alfonso acquiesced, choosing Mercedes' sister Mar\u00eda Cristina. She also contracted tuberculosis, and died during the engagement period. In late 1879, he married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen; the eldest of their children, the Princess of Asturias, was named in honour of Queen Mercedes. Ancestry\nPassage 3:\nLouise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans\nLouise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans (13 March 1753 \u2013 23 June 1821), was the daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre and Princess Maria Teresa d'Este. At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre, Prince of Lamballe, she became the wealthiest heiress in France prior to the French Revolution. She married Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the \"regicide\" Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, and was the mother of France's last king, Louis Philippe I. She was sister-in-law to Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Louise, Princess of Lamballe, and was the last member of the Bourbon-Penthi\u00e8vre family. Early life\nMarie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was born on 13 March 1753 at the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse, the family residence in Paris since 1712, when her grandfather, Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, bought it from Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux de La Vrilli\u00e8re. She was the youngest daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre and his wife, Princess Maria Teresa d'Este. Her mother died in childbirth the following year. Styled Mademoiselle d'Ivoy initially and, as a young girl, until her marriage, Mademoiselle de Penthi\u00e8vre (derived from the duchy inherited by her father). The style of Mademoiselle de Penthi\u00e8vre had been previously borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon (1751\u20131753), who died six months after Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's birth. Education\nAt birth, she was put in the care of Madame de Sourcy and, as was the custom for many girls of the nobility, she was later raised at the Abbaye de Montmartre convent, overlooking Paris, where she spent twelve years."

      "Through his research, Peter uncovers that Jeff was found drowned in Crystal Lake in 1946 under mysterious circumstances. Marcia is suspicious of Peter and curious about his motives, specifically how much he seems to know about her life. Ann and Peter quickly develop a romance, much to the disapproval of Marcia, who responds by increasingly drinking and taking prescription drugs. Peter initially has some hesitation toward pursuing a relationship with Ann after considering that she may have been his daughter in a previous life, but he ultimately chooses to continue the romance. Ann tells Peter her father proposed to Marcia in the same area where they just made love. One afternoon, Marcia accompanies Peter and Ann to the country club, where they lounge at the poolside. While Ann goes for a swim, Marcia witnesses a sleeping Peter repeating the phrase \"Marcia, don't!\" in Jeff's voice. This horrifies her, and she flees home where she locks herself in her bedroom. Later, she masturbates to the memory of Jeff raping her after she confronted him about an affair he had while she was pregnant with Ann. The following day, Marcia confronts Peter, demanding to know his true identity. The two get into a heated argument, during which he confirms that he is a reincarnation of her deceased husband. Meanwhile, Peter realizes that by having re-enacted or visited the sites of his visions, they seem to have ceased haunting him. The lake vision of Jeff's murder is his last to be conquered. Drawn to the lake where Jeff died years prior, Peter enters the water, hoping to unfetter himself from the vision. While in the water, Marcia approaches him in the same boat she did Jeff years ago, now brandishing a pistol. Addressing Peter as Jeff, Marcia asks why he has returned to torment her, and accuses him of incest with Ann. When Peter tries to climb into the boat, Marcia shoots him to death. She watches as his body sinks to the bottom of the lake. Cast\nProduction\nFilm rights to the novel were sold to Bing Crosby Productions before the novel had been published.",
      "It follows a university professor who, after experiencing a series of bizarre nightmares, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of someone else. It is based on the 1973 novel of the same title by Max Ehrlich, who adapted the screenplay. Plot\nPeter Proud, a college professor in Los Angeles, begins having recurring dreams he cannot explain. In one particular nightmare, Peter witnesses the murder of a young man by his girlfriend, Marcia, while he swims naked in a lake near a hotel. As he screams his final words, \"Marcia, don't!,\" she bludgeons him with an oar, and he drowns. In subsequent dreams, Peter witnesses brief vignettes from the man's life, including romances with two different women, and has visions of houses and landmarks that are unknown to him. Peter is haunted by his dreams and seeks medical treatment. He attends a sleep laboratory to try to decipher his dreams. However, the resident doctor, Sam Goodman, informs him that his dreams do not register as being dreams; in fact, they do not register at all. One evening while watching television, several of Peter's visions play out before him on a local documentary film titled The Changing Face of America. He sees an arch and church in the documentary that have figured prominently in his dreams, and calls the television station to discover the location. Upon learning that the location of his \"visions\" is in Massachusetts, Proud and his girlfriend Nora travel there. In Massachusetts, the couple drive from town to town, but are unsuccessful until they arrive in Springfield. It is here that Proud begins to see familiar sights from his visions, such as a bridge, a church, the Puritan statue, and others. Nora decides to return to California, tired of Peter's relentless searching, which she dismisses as delusion. After Nora leaves, Peter continues his journey. Eventually, Peter locates Marcia, the mystery woman from his nightmares, now a middle-aged alcoholic. Peter subsequently befriends Marcia's daughter Ann at a local country club where Marcia's husband Jeff was once a tennis pro; Ann has recently returned home to care for her emotionally unstable mother."

      "D) The poem is a fragmentary hymn to Inanna, with the concluding section being very fragmentary and possibly a later addition."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "The poem starts with a hymn to Inanna as \"lady of battle\" (lines 1\u201324) then shifts to a narration by Inanna herself in the first person (lines 25\u201352), where she describes the revenge she wants to take on the mountains of Ebih for their refusal to bow to her. Inanna then visits the sky god An and requests his assistance (lines 53\u2013111), but An doubts Inanna's ability to take revenge (lines 112\u2013130). This causes Inanna to fly into a rage and attack Ebih (lines 131\u2013159). Inanna then recounts how she overthrew Ebih (lines 160\u2013181) and the poem ends with a praise of Inanna (lines 182\u2013184). The \"rebel lands\" of Ebih that are overthrown in the poem have been identifiedwith the Jebel Hamrin mountain range in modern Iraq. Black et al. describe these lands as \"home to the nomadic, barbarian tribes who loom large in Sumerian literature as forces of destruction and chaos\" that sometimes need to be \"brought under divine control\". Hymns dedicated to Nanna\nThese two hymns, labeled by Westenholz as Hymn of Praise to Ekisnugal and Nanna on [the] Assumption of En-ship (incipit e ugim e-a) and Hymn of Praise of Enheduanna (incipit lost). The second hymn is very fragmentary. Authorship debate\nThe question of Enheduanna's authorship of poems has been subject to significant debate. While Hallo and \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6berg were the first to definitively assert Enheduanna's authorship of the works attributed to her, other Assyriologists including Miguel Civil and Jeremy Black have put forth arguments rejecting or doubting Enheduanna's authorship. Civil has raised the possibility that \"Enheduanna\" refers not to the name, but instead the station of EN-priestess that the daughter of Sargon of Akkad held. For the Inanna and Nanna poems, Black et al. argue that at best, all of the manuscript sources date from at least six centuries after when she would have lived, and they were found in scribal settings, not ritual ones, and that \"surviving sources show no traces of Old Sumerian... making it impossible to posit what that putative original might have looked like.",
      "Probably composed in exile in \u011cirsu, the song is intended to persuade the goddess Inanna to intervene in the conflict in favor of Enheduanna and the Sargonian dynasty. To reach this, the text constructs a myth: An, the king of the gods, endows the goddess Inanna with divine powers and has her execute his judgment on all the cities of Sumer, making her herself the ruler of the land and most powerful of all the gods. When now the city of Ur rebels against her rule, Inanna passes her judgment over it and has it executed by Nanna, the city god of Ur and her father. Inanna has thus become the mistress of heaven and earth alike - and thus empowered to enforce her will even over the originally superior gods (An and Nanna), which results in the destruction of Ur and Lugal-Ane. Hymn to Inanna\nThis hymn (incipit in-nin \u0161a-gur-ra) which is only partially preserved in a fragmentary form, is outlined by Black et al. as containing three parts: an introductory section (lines 1-90) emphasizing Inanna's \"martial abilities\"; a long, middle section (lines 91-218) that serves as a direct address to Inanna, listing her many positive and negative powers, and asserting her superiority over other deities, and a concluding section (219\u2013274) narrated by Enheduanna that exists in a very fragmentary form. Black et al. surmise that the fragmentary nature of the concluding section makes it unclear whether Enheduanna composed the hymn, the concluding section was a later addition, or that her name was added to the poem later in the Old Babylonian period from \"a desire to attribute it to her\". They also note that the concluding section also appears to reference \"some historical events which cannot be elucidated.\" This poem also contains a potential reference to the events described in Inanna and Ebih, which has led Westenholz to suggest that that poem may have been written by Enheduanna as well. The first English translation of this work was by Sj\u00f6berg in 1975. Inanna and Ebih\nThis hymn (incipit in-nin me-hu\u0161-a) is characterized by Black et al. as \"Inanna in warrior mode.\""

    "documentation": [
      "The celebrated opera librettist Pietro Metastasio (1698\u20131782) although he had his own differences with Arcadia, was a student of Gravina's, and a leading light of the academy's second generation. His works, of which the best remembered might be Il Re Pastore because of its setting by Mozart, may represent the closest thing to a justification of the program that Arcadia achieved. In 1795, the academy admitted the Italian Diodata Saluzzo Roero, as one of its first female members, but some evidence does exist for earlier female members. In the 17th century, the poet Maria Antonia Scalera Stellini was elected a member, and the 1721 edition of the Academy's publication included work by Caterina Imperiale Lercari Pallavicini. Anti-Arcadian Reaction\nA violent anti-Arcadian reaction soon developed, and, starting from the early 19th century, Arcadianism began to be regarded as a late and unconvincing expression of the ancien r\u00e9gime. After the end of the French Revolution, the Academy strove to renew itself in accord with the spirit of the times, without sacrificing its traditional system of sylvan associations and pastoral names. The Academy no longer represented a literary school, but a general interest in the classics and figures like Dante came to be greatly honoured by its members. Furthermore, the Academy's field of endeavour was enlarged to include many branches of study, including history and archaeology. The new Arcadian revival was marked by the foundation (1819) of the Giornale Arcadico. In 1925 the Academy was renamed to become the Arcadia \u2013 Accademia Letteraria Italiana, a historical institute. Legacy\nThe Accademia degli Arcadi counted among its members some of the principal literary men and women of the time, including Carlo Alessandro Guidi, Petronilla Paolini Massimi, Benedetto Menzini, librettist Pietro Metastasio, Francesco Redi Paolo Rolli, and linguist Clotilde Tambroni, among others. The famous composer George Frideric Handel is known to have often attended the meetings and symposia of the Arcadians when studying in Italy, under the patronage of Ruspoli, a leading member of the Academy.",
      "Passage 1:\nPontifical Academy of Arcadia\nThe Accademia degli Arcadi or Accademia dell'Arcadia, \"Academy of Arcadia\" or \"Academy of the Arcadians\", was an Italian literary academy founded in Rome in 1690. The full Italian official name was Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi. History\nFoundation\nThe beginnings of the Accademia degli Arcadi date to February 1656, when a literary circle formed under the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had abdicated the Swedish crown in 1654, converted to Catholicism, and taken up her residence in Rome, where she spent much of the rest of her life. There she became a significant patron of music and opera, with composers including Alessandro Scarlatti, Alessandro Stradella and Arcangelo Corelli dedicating works to her. After her death in 1689, the academy was established in her memory and elected her as its symbolic head (basilissa, the Greek term for 'Queen'). The Academy lasted for the next two hundred years, remaining a leading cultural institution into the 20th century. The Accademia degli Arcadi was so-called because its principal intention was to reform the diction of Italian poetry, which the founders believed had become corrupt through over-indulgence in the ornamentation of the baroque style, under the inspiration of pastoral literature, the conventions of which imagined the life of shepherds, originally supposed to have lived in Arcadia in the golden age, divinely inspired in poetry by the Muses, Apollo, Hermes and Pan. The Academy chose as its emblem the pipe of Pan with its seven unequal reeds. The fourteen founders selected as the first Custode di Arcadia or president of the academy, Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni who was the author of a history of Italian poetry and of various literary works. The Arcadians resolved to return to the fields of truth, always singing of subjects of pastoral simplicity and drawing their inspiration from Greco-Roman bucolic poetry. The ideal parameters for the artistic work were simplicity and a sense of measure and beauty."

At the Dragon Sect camp, Ying-hung and Fung Sek-fan secretly poisons Lung-er and turn the followers against her. She escapes with Siu-bo but must have sex with a man before dawn, otherwise she will die. However, this will transfer 4/5th of her martial arts' power to whomever she sleeps with. Despite Siu-bo's lecherous personality, Lung-er accepts his blunt honesty as a sign of virtue and chooses to sacrifice her virginity to Siu-bo and becomes his third wife. When Siu-bo gets back to the Princess, they execute a plan to castrate Ying-hung. With her betrothed no longer able to produce heirs, the Princess is taken by Siu-bo as his fourth wife. Enraged by the end of his family line, Ng Ying-hung prematurely gathers his troops and sets out to wage war with the Emperor. He tasks Fung Sek-fan with killing the Princess and Siu-bo. Though Chan Kan-nam manages to intervene and lets his disciple escape. Later, the One Arm Nun captures the elopers, Ying-hung and Ah Ko, and offers them to Siu-bo.

Siu-bo's newfound power is difficult for him to control, and Chan helps him master it in time for him to use it against Fung.

      "The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far. \"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors. He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.

The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education. During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\" Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "documentation": [
      "In the article, Rohmer writes that in an age of cultural self-consciousness, film is \"the last refuge of poetry\" and the only contemporary art form from which metaphor can still spring naturally and spontaneously. In 1957 Rohmer and Claude Chabrol wrote Hitchcock (Paris: \u00c9ditions Universitaires, 1957), the earliest book-length study of Alfred Hitchcock. It focuses on Hitchcock's Catholic background and has been called \"one of the most influential film books since the Second World War, casting new light on a filmmaker hitherto considered a mere entertainer\". Hitchcock helped establish the auteur theory as a critical method and contributed to the reevaluation of the American cinema that was central to that method. By 1963 Rohmer was becoming more at odds with some of the more radical left-wing critics at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He continued to admire US films while many of the other left-wing critics had rejected them and were championing cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and Marxist film criticism. Rohmer resigned that year and was succeeded by Rivette. Film career\n1950\u20131962: Shorts and early film career In 1950 Rohmer made his first 16mm short film, Journal d'un sc\u00e9l\u00e9rat. The film starred writer Paul G\u00e9gauff and was made with a borrowed camera. By 1951 Rohmer had a bigger budget provided by friends and shot the short film Pr\u00e9sentation ou Charlotte et son steak. The 12-minute film was co-written by and starred Jean-Luc Godard. The film was not completed until 1961. In 1952 Rohmer began collaborating with Pierre Guilbaud on a one-hour short feature, Les Petites Filles mod\u00e8les, but the film was never finished. In 1954 Rohmer made and acted in B\u00e9r\u00e9nice, a 15-minute short based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1956 Rohmer directed, wrote, edited and starred in La Sonate \u00e0 Kreutzer, a 50-minute film produced by Godard. In 1958 Rohmer made V\u00e9ronique et son cancre, a 20-minute short produced by Chabrol. Chabrol's company AJYM produced Rohmer's feature directorial debut, The Sign of Leo (Le Signe du lion) in 1959. In the film an American composer spends the month of August waiting for his inheritance while all his friends are on vacation and gradually becomes impoverished.",
      "Unlike all of his future New Wave contemporaries, Chabrol never made short film nor did he work as an assistant on other directors' work before making his feature film debut. In 1957 Chabrol and Eric Rohmer co-wrote Hitchcock (Paris: \u00c9ditions Universitaires, 1957), a study of the films made by director Alfred Hitchcock through the film The Wrong Man. Chabrol had said that Rohmer deserves the majority of the credit for the book, while he mainly worked on the sections pertaining to Hitchcock's early American films, Rebecca, Notorious, and Stage Fright. Chabrol had interviewed Hitchcock with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut in 1954 on the set of To Catch a Thief, where the two famously walked into a water tank after being starstruck by Hitchcock. Years later, when Chabrol and Truffaut had both become successful directors themselves, Hitchcock told Truffaut that he always thought of them when he saw \"ice cubes in a glass of whiskey. \"\n\n1957\u201367: Early film career\nThe most prolific of the major New Wave directors, Chabrol averaged almost one film a year from 1958 until his death. His early films (roughly 1958\u20131963) are usually categorized as part of the New Wave and generally have the experimental qualities associated with the movement; while his later early films are usually categorized as being intentionally commercial and far less experimental. In the mid-sixties it was difficult for Chabrol to obtain financing for films so he made a series of commercial \"potboilers\" and spy spoofs, which none of the other New Wave filmmakers did. Chabrol had married Agn\u00e8s Goute in 1952 and in 1957 his wife inherited a large sum of money from relatives. In December of that year Chabrol used the money to make his feature directorial debut with Le Beau Serge. Chabrol spent three months shooting in his hometown of Sardent using a small crew and little known actors. The film's budget was $85,000. The film starred Jean-Claude Brialy as Fran\u00e7ois and G\u00e9rard Blain as Serge, two childhood friends reunited when the recent medical school graduate Fran\u00e7ois returns to Sardent and discovers that Serge has become an alcoholic after the stillbirth of his physically retarded first child.",
      "Despite suffering from tuberculosis, Fran\u00e7ois drags Serge through a snowstorm to witness the birth of his second child, thus giving Serge a reason to live while killing himself in the process. Le Beau Serge is considered the inaugural film of the French New Wave Film movement that would peak between 1959 and 1962. Chabrol was the first of his friends to complete a feature film (although Jacques Rivette had already begun filming his first feature Paris nous appartient), and it immediately received critical praise and was a box office success. It won the Grand Prix at the Locarno Film Festival and the Prix Jean Vigo. Critics noticed similarities to Hitchcock's films, such as the motifs of doubling and re-occurrences and the \"Catholic guilt transference\" that Chabrol had also written about extensively in his and Rohmer's book the year earlier. Chabrol stated that he made the film as a \"farewell to Catholicism\", and many critics have called his first film vastly different from any of his subsequent films. Chabrol quickly followed this success up with Les Cousins in 1958. The film is a companion piece and a reversal to Le Beau Serge in many ways, such as having the responsible student Brialy now play the decadent and insensitive Paul while the reckless Blain now plays the hard-working law student Charles. In this film, the country cousin Charles arrives in the big city of Paris to live with his corrupt cousin Paul while attending school. This was the first of many Chabrol films to include characters named Paul and Charles, and later films would often include a female named H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. More so than his first film, Les Cousins features many characteristics that would be seen as \"Chabrolian\", including the Hitchcock influence, a depiction of the French bourgeoisie, characters with ambiguous motives and a murder. It was also Chabrol's first film co-written with his longtime collaborator Paul G\u00e9gauff, of whom Chabrol once said \"when I want cruelty, I go off and look for G\u00e9gauff. Paul is very good at gingering things up...He can make a character look absolutely ridiculous and hateful in two seconds flat.\""

      "The film's TV rights were picked up by A&E IndieFilms after a well-received screening at Sundance. Early life\nCorman was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Anne (n\u00e9e High) and William Corman, an engineer. His younger brother, Gene, produced numerous films, sometimes in collaboration with Roger. Corman and his brother were raised Catholic. Corman went to Beverly Hills High School and then to Stanford University to study industrial engineering. While at Stanford, Corman realized he did not want to be an engineer. He enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program with six months of study to complete. After serving in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a Bachelor of Science in industrial engineering in 1947. While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. In 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on Slauson Avenue in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss \"I've made a terrible mistake.\" Gene Corman was already working in the film industry as an agent, and Roger decided to go into filmmaking instead. Early film career\nCorman found work at 20th Century Fox initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as The Gunfighter with Gregory Peck. When Corman received no credit at all, he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the G.I. Bill, Corman studied English literature at Oxford University and lived in Paris for a time. He then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stagehand at KLAC and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to agent Dick Hyland, a literary agent. Highway Dragnet\nCorman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to William F. Broidy at Allied Artists for $2,000."

      "A) William of St. Barbara",
      "B) William Middleton",
      "C) Wilfred (or William) Langdon Kihn",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "However, in August 1295 William was dismissed as treasurer, although the financial policies did not change. It may be that King Edward I used March as a scapegoat, or it may be that some charges that citizens of London brought against the treasurer were felt to be valid. After his dismissal from the treasurership in 1295, he devoted himself to the care of his diocese, and was regarded as a pious bishop. William died on 11 June 1302 although current historical research is challenging that date. He was buried at Wells Cathedral in the south transept wall on 17 June 1302. In 1325 there was a petition for him to be canonized, which continued to be supported by kings Edward II and Edward III. William is supposed to have built the chapter house at Wells. His will named a brother, John March, and a nephew, Robert Urry, to whom William left monies to go on crusade in William's name. Citations\nPassage 7:\nWilliam Middleton (bishop)\nWilliam Middleton (or William de Middleton; died 31 August or 1 September 1288) was a medieval Bishop of Norwich. Life\nMiddleton began his career as a clerk in the Jewish exchequer in 1265. He was given custody of the rolls in 1276, and in 1277 was at the French royal court. He was an official of Canterbury when he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby in October 1275. He may also have held a prebend in the diocese of London. Middleton was elected on 24 February 1278 and was consecrated on 29 May 1278. He was enthroned at Norwich Cathedral on 27 November 1278. He continued to work on royal administrative business after his election and consecration. In July 1287 Middleton was appointed to the offices of Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine. He died 31 August or 1 September 1288. Citations\nPassage 8:\nWilliam of St. Barbara\nWilliam of St. Barbara or William of Ste Barbe (died 1152) was a medieval Bishop of Durham. Life\nFrom William's name, it is presumed that he was a native of Sainte-Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados in Normandy (Neustria).",
      "He was a canon of York Minster in 1128. He was Dean of York by December 1138.William was elected to the see of Durham on 14 March 1143 and consecrated on 20 June 1143. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. However, the new bishop was not able to enter Durham right away, and he was enthroned either on 18 October 1144 or shortly thereafter. Troubles continued in Durham, and the bishop was unable to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148, which led to a suspension by the pope for inattendance. William supported Henry Murdac in the disputed election to the archbishopric of York, and it was probably Murdac who arranged for the suspension to be lifted. William also supported the Cistercians and the Augustinians, which perturbed  his cathedral chapter which was made up of Benedictine monks. He died 13 November 1152. A grave identified as his was excavated in the 19th century in the chapter house of  Durham Cathedral. Citations\nPassage 9:\nW. Langdon Kihn\nWilfred (or William) Langdon Kihn (September 5, 1898 \u2013 December 12, 1957) was a portrait painter and illustrator specializing in portraits of American Indians. Life and career\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of Alfred Charles Kihn and Carrie Lowe (Peck) Kihn. He attended Boys' High School in Brooklyn and was recognized there for his artistic talent. He married Helen Van Tine Butler in 1920, and lived in Hadlyme and Moodus, Connecticut. He studied with the Art Students League, 1916\u201317, and was a pupil of Homer Boss and Winold Reiss. Motivated by a desire to document the disappearing aboriginal culture, he spent many years visiting and living with Indian tribes in the Western United States. In 1920, he was admitted to the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, under the name \"Zoi-och-ka-tsai-ya,\" meaning \"Chase Enemy in Water\".",
      "He was also appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1265. Despite this, he was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars. His main focus was on planning his forthcoming crusade. Crusade and accession\nEdward pledged himself to undertake a crusade in an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268, with his brother Edmund Crouchback and cousin Henry of Almain. Some of Edward's former adversaries, such as John de Vescy and the 7th Earl of Gloucester, similarly committed themselves, although some, like Gloucester, did not ultimately participate. With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was acquiring sufficient finances. King Louis IX of France, who was the leader of the crusade, provided a loan of about \u00a317,500. This was not enough, and the rest had to be raised through a direct tax on the laity, which had not been levied since 1237. In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of one-twentieth of all movable property; in exchange the King agreed to reconfirm the Magna Carta, and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending. On 20 August Edward sailed from Dover for France. Historians have not determined the size of his accompanying force with any certainty, but it was probably fewer than 1000 men, including around 225 knights. Originally, the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre in Palestine, but King Louis and his brother Charles of Anjou, the king of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate of Tunis to establish a stronghold in North Africa. The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25 August, killed Louis himself. By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the Emir, and there was little to do but return to Sicily. Further military action was postponed until the following spring, but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded both Charles and Philip III, Louis' successor, from any further campaigning. Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9 May 1271 he finally landed at Acre."

      "B) Fritz Lang's film \"Metropolis\" was a financial flop and nearly destroyed the studio UFA.",

      "D) Fritz Lang's film \"M\" (1931) was his first \"talking\" picture and is considered a masterpiece of the early sound era."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "He moved to Paris, having divorced Thea von Harbou, who stayed behind, earlier in 1933.In Paris, Lang filmed a version of Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's Liliom, starring Charles Boyer. That was Lang's only film in French (excluding the French version of Testament). He then moved to the United States. Hollywood career (1936\u20131957)\nLang made twenty-three features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.Signing first with MGM Studios, Lang's crime drama Fury (1936) saw Spencer Tracy cast as a man who is wrongly accused of a crime and nearly killed when a lynch mob sets fire to the jail where he is awaiting trial. However, in Fury, he was not allowed to represent black victims in a lynching scenario or to criticize racism, which was his original intention. By the time Fury was released, Lang had been involved in the creation of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, working with Otto Katz, a Czech who was a Comintern spy. He made four films with an explicitly anti-Nazi theme, Man Hunt (1941), Hangmen Also Die! (1943), Ministry of Fear (1944) and Cloak and Dagger (1946). Man Hunt, wrote Dave Kehr in 2009, \"may be the best\" of the \"many interventionist films produced by the Hollywood studios before Pearl Harbor\" as it is \"clean and concentrated, elegant and precise, pointed without being preachy. \" His American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, although the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema, film noir in particular. Scarlet Street (1945), one of his films featuring Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett, is considered a central film in the genre. One of Lang's most praised films noir is the police drama The Big Heat (1953), known for its uncompromising brutality, especially for a scene in which Lee Marvin throws scalding coffee on Gloria Grahame's face.",
      "At the end of 1932, Lang started filming The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, and by March 30, the new regime banned it as an incitement to public disorder. Testament is sometimes deemed an anti-Nazi film, as Lang had put phrases used by the Nazis into the mouth of the title character. A screening of the film was cancelled by Joseph Goebbels, and it was later banned by the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. In banning the film, Goebbels stated that the film \"showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence\", and that the film posed a threat to public health and safety. Lang was worried about the advent of the Nazi regime, partly because of his Jewish heritage, whereas his wife and co-screenwriter Thea von Harbou had started to sympathize with the Nazis in the early 1930s, and later joined the NSDAP in 1940. They soon divorced. Lang's fears would be realized following his departure from Austria, as under the Nuremberg Laws he would be identified as half-Jewish by ethnicity even though his mother was a converted Roman Catholic, and he was raised as such. Emigration According to Lang, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels called Lang to his offices to inform him \u2013 apologetically \u2013 that The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was being banned but, nevertheless, he was so impressed by Lang's abilities as a filmmaker (especially Metropolis), that he offered Lang the position of head of German film studio UFA. Lang said it was during that meeting he had decided to leave for Paris \u2013 but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over. Lang claimed that, after selling his wife's jewelry, he fled by train to Paris that evening, leaving most of his money and personal possessions behind. However, his passport of the time showed that he traveled to and from Germany a few times during 1933.Lang left Berlin for good on July 31, 1933, four months after his meeting with Goebbels and his initial departure.",
      "In this first phase of his career, Lang alternated between films such as Der M\u00fcde Tod (\"The Weary Death\") and popular thrillers such as Die Spinnen (\"The Spiders\"), combining popular genres with Expressionist techniques to create an unprecedented synthesis of popular entertainment with art cinema. In 1920, Lang met his future wife, the writer Thea von Harbou. She and Lang co-wrote all of his movies from 1921 through 1933, including Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (\"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler,\" 1922 - which ran for over four hours, in two parts in the original version, and was the first in the Dr. Mabuse trilogy), the five-hour Die Nibelungen (1924), the dystopian film Metropolis (1927), and the science fiction film Woman in the Moon (1929). Metropolis went far over budget and nearly destroyed UFA, which was bought by right-wing businessman and politician Alfred Hugenberg. It was a financial flop, as were his last silent films Spies (1928) and Woman in the Moon, produced by Lang's own company. In 1931, independent producer Seymour Nebenzahl hired Lang to direct M for Nero-Film. His first \"talking\" picture, considered by many film scholars to be a masterpiece of the early sound era, M is a disturbing story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre in his first starring role) who is hunted down and brought to rough justice by Berlin's criminal underworld. M remains a powerful work; it was remade in 1951 by Joseph Losey, but this version had little impact on audiences, and has become harder to see than the original film. During the climactic final scene in M, Lang allegedly threw Peter Lorre down a flight of stairs in order to give more authenticity to Lorre's battered look. Lang, who was known for being hard to work with, epitomized the stereotype of the tyrannical Germanic film director, a type embodied also by Erich von Stroheim and Otto Preminger; Lang wore a monocle, adding to the stereotype. In the films of his German period, Lang produced a coherent oeuvre that established the characteristics later attributed to film noir, with its recurring themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity."

    "documentation": [
      "The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time. Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \"pay for hire\" backup groups for her recordings. This \"sound\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers. At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \"I've Got A Feeling\"/\"Oh Yeah\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \"Where Did My Jimmy Go\"/\"Tra la la, I Love You\" was the result (Diamond). Later life\nBaron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree. Baron's \"I've Got a Feeling\" was covered by The Secret Sisters on their 2010 self-titled album as well as being released as a single. AllMusic describes Baron's song as \"an early-'60s pop/rock obscurity\". Passage 9:\nRameshwari Nehru\nRameshwari Nehru (n\u00e9e Rameshwari Raina; 10 December 1886 \u2013 8 November 1966) was a social worker of India. She worked for the upliftment of the poorer classes and of women. In 1902, she married Brijlal Nehru, a nephew of Motilal Nehru and cousin of the first prime minister of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Her son Braj Kumar Nehru was an Indian civil servant who served as governor of several states. She edited Stri Darpan, a Hindi monthly for women, from 1909 to 1924. She was one of the founders of All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and was elected its president in 1942. She led delegations to the  World Women's Congress in Copenhagen and the first Afro-Asian Women's Conference in Cairo (1961).Nehru was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India for her social work, in 1955, and won the Lenin Peace Prize in 1961.She was one of the signatories of the Agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.",
      "The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \"Rock and Roll\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer. Recording career\nAt the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "However, he did not earn a place on the 1957 AL All-Star team. In 1958, the 36-year-old Wilson concluded his 16-season playing career, working in 28 games for the White Sox, 23 in a starting role. In his final MLB game, September 14 against the Washington Senators, he worked 82\u20443 innings and surrendered five earned runs, but was credited with the victory in a 6\u20135 Chicago triumph. That season he also continued his skein of errorless games as a pitcher. On June 15, 1955, as an Oriole, he muffed an eighth-inning foul pop-up by the White Sox' Jim Rivera for an error. It was the last miscue he would commit in his career, which spanned 116 games through his 1958 retirement. Wilson posted a career .988  fielding percentage, committing only 4 miscues in  333 total chances. Altogether, Wilson appeared in 257 Major League games pitched, 217 as a starter. He compiled an 86\u201389 won-lost mark, with 75 complete games and 19 shutouts. In 1,539 innings pitched he notched 692 strikeouts. Wilson also allowed 1,479 hits, 608 bases on balls and 686 earned runs. His career earned run average was 4.01. As a scout and executive\nWilson remained in the game as a scout for the Orioles and Houston Astros. He and scout Jim Russo signed Jim Palmer for the Orioles in 1963. Palmer recalled in a 1996 book that though 13 teams were interested in him, the Orioles scouts set themselves apart with their polite manners. In 1971, Wilson came back to Milwaukee as the director of scouting and player development of the Brewers, a three-year-old expansion team, and following the 1972 season, he succeeded Frank Lane as Milwaukee's general manager. Although Lane was renowned as a trader, Wilson completed a blockbuster transaction of his own with the Phillies on October 31, 1972, acquiring third baseman Don Money in a seven-player deal. Money would play 11 seasons for the Brewers and make four American League All-Star teams. Then, in June 1973, during his first draft as Brewers' general manager, Wilson selected Robin Yount with the club's first pick (third overall).",
      "During his front office career he served as the third general manager in the franchise history of the Milwaukee Brewers. Career\nAs a player\nA native of San Diego, Wilson threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He attended San Diego State University. Wilson pitched in all or part of 12 seasons (1945\u201346; 1948\u201349; 1951\u201358) for five Major League franchises and six different cities: the Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Browns/Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston / Milwaukee Braves and Chicago White Sox. He began his pro career during World War II in 1943 in the Red Sox' farm system and in his second year, 1944, he won 19 games with the top-level Louisville Colonels of the American Association. He made the 1945 Red Sox' roster coming out of spring training and started 21 games for them during the season's first four months. In his 21st start, on August 9 at Briggs Stadium,  Wilson worked into the tenth inning of a 3\u20133 game. With one out, Detroit Tigers' slugger Hank Greenberg hit a line drive back through the box that struck Wilson in the head, fracturing his skull and sending him to Henry Ford Hospital. The injury sidelined Wilson for the rest of the campaign and he would pitch only one more game for the Red Sox, on April 23, 1946. Wilson returned to Louisville for the balance of 1946 and all of 1947, then was included in a trade to the Browns that yielded slugging shortstop Vern Stephens and starting pitcher Jack Kramer. But 1948 and 1949 saw Wilson bounce among four organizations\u2014the Browns, Cleveland Indians, Tigers and Athletics\u2014and make ineffective appearances in six total big-league games for the Browns and A's. Finally, in 1950, he was acquired by the Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, managed by Paul Richards. Wilson won 24 games (losing 11) for a sixth-place team and led the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts. His contract was purchased by the Boston Braves at season's end, and Wilson returned to the Major Leagues for good.",
      "Wilson's first All-Star season came in 1954 for the Milwaukee Braves; they had moved from Boston in March 1953. He no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies, 2\u20130 at Milwaukee County Stadium on June 12 of that season. The 32-year-old right-hander beat future Hall of Famer Robin Roberts in the one-hour and 43-minute contest. Wilson issued two bases on balls (both to Phillies' catcher Smoky Burgess) and struck out six. The no-hitter was the first in the Braves' Milwaukee history. Wilson was named an All-Star in the midst of an 8\u20132 season in 27 games pitched with three other complete game shutouts for the contending Braves. But he did not get into the 1954 Midsummer classic, an 11\u20139 loss for his National League squad at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. On the eve of the 1955 season, Richards, by now both the general manager and field manager of the Baltimore Orioles, purchased Wilson's contract and moved him into the starting rotation. Wilson led the American League in games lost (18) that season (as a team, Baltimore lost 97 games), but he again registered four shutouts and was selected to the AL All-Star team, chosen to play in the July 12, 1955, game at his old home field, County Stadium. But again Wilson did not appear and, again, his team was defeated, with the Senior Circuit winning 6\u20135 in 12 innings. Wilson began 1956 by winning four of his first six decisions in seven starts for Baltimore despite sporting a high (5.03) earned run average. On May 21, Richards traded him to the first-division White Sox, and although he pitched more effectively, he registered only a 9\u201312 record for Chicago. Nevertheless, Wilson was selected to the 1956 American League All-Star team, and this time he played in the game at Griffith Stadium in Washington, working one inning in the AL's 7\u20133 loss, allowing two hits and one earned run, although he retired Willie Mays on a called third strike to register the final out. That set the stage for Wilson's most successful big-league season, with the 1957 White Sox. He won a career-high 15 games (losing eight), and led the American League in shutouts, with five."

It was the first in a 12-film series featuring Bomba, a sort of teenage Tarzan, played by Johnny Sheffield, who as a child had played \"Boy\" in several previous Tarzan films. Plot\nA photographer and his daughter arrive in Africa hoping to capture the local wildlife on film. Instead, they encounter (and never end up photographing) a killer leopard, a swarm of locusts, deadly lion worshippers, and Bomba the Jungle Boy. Bomba was raised by an aged naturalist, Cody Casson (since deceased). He now lives beyond the Great Rift. The photographer's daughter, wearing a well-tailored leopard skin, spends most of the film with Bomba, while her father, Commissioner Barnes, and Eli search for her. Cast\nJohnny Sheffield as Bomba\nPeggy Ann Garner as Patricia Harlan\nOnslow Stevens as George Harland\nCharles Irwin as Andy Barnes\nSmoki Whitfield as Eli\nMartin Wilkins as Mufti\n\nProduction\nWalter Mirisch had been general manager of Monogram Pictures since 1945. They specialised in low-budget movies, including series of regular characters such as Charlie Chan, Joe Palooka and the Bowery Boys. Mirisch looked at the success of the Tarzan films and remembered the Bomba novels; he thought they might offer material to do a similar type of movie. In November 1947 Monogram announced they had bought the rights to twenty of the stories. They assigned Walter Mirisch to oversee their production and said they intended to make three Bomba films per year.",

      "The building is now demolished but the original site is directly opposite Maidenhead Town Hall, as featured in Carry On Doctor, Carry On Again Doctor and Carry On Behind. Clarence Crescent, Windsor - location of the very final scene of the moviePinewood Studios was used for both interior and exterior filming. Production and casting\nCarry On Up the Jungle is, in part, a parody of Hammer Film Productions' \"Cavegirl\" series: One Million Years B.C. (1966), Slave Girls (1967) and more particularly Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan series of books and films. Bernard Bresslaw learned all his native orders in Swahili; however, the \"African\" extras were of Caribbean origin and did not understand. But Sid James, who was born in South Africa, recognised it and congratulated him. The storyline is partly referenced in the Christmas Special Carry On, when all the characters sit down for Christmas Dinner and eat the Oozlum bird instead of a traditional Turkey. Charles Hawtrey (born November 1914) as Walter Bagley plays the father of Ugg/Cecil Bagley Terry Scott (born May 1927) despite being merely twelve and a half years his senior. Joan Sims (born May 1930) as Lady Bagley plays his mother though she is three years his junior. The role of Professor Tinkle was written for Kenneth Williams, and the role of Jungle Boy was written for Jim Dale, but Williams was unavailable as he was preparing to star in his own series, The Kenneth Williams Show, and Dale turned down his part due to the character having limited dialogue. Reception\nThe film was among the eight most popular movies at the UK box office in 1970.In a diary entry for Saturday 3 April 1976, Kenneth Williams wrote about the film, which he watched on television that evening, in positive terms. \"It was quite funny and at one point I was laughing aloud. I was staggered to see what they got away with!\" He was particularly complimentary about Kenneth Connor and Terry Scott, less so about Sid James. Passage 10:\nFollow That Camel\nFollow That Camel is a 1967 British comedy film, the 14th in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958\u20131992)."

      "The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party. Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse. As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation \u2013 more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. Sophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von H\u00f6pken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.",

She was the daughter of king Frederick I of Denmark and Sophie of Pomerania. She was married to Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch in 1573. Dorothea was raised with her maternal grand parents in Pomerania as a child, but spent her adult life at the Danish royal court and with her mother in Kiel. She took part in the entourage of her niece Anne of Denmark at the latter's wedding in Saxony in 1548, but otherwise she lived a discreet life. She died two years after her marriage, and her sister Elizabeth of Denmark had a monument erected over her grave.

Brought up by Christian missionaries, she married Maharaja Duleep Singh and became Maharani Bamba, wife of the last Maharaja of Lahore. Her transformation from illegitimate girl, born to a German father and Abyssinian (Ethiopian) mother, living in a Cairo mission to a Maharani living a life of luxury with the \"Black Prince of Perthshire\" has been compared to the \"Cinderella\" story. Biography\nBamba M\u00fcller was the daughter of Ludwig M\u00fcller, a German merchant banker with the company Todd M\u00fcller and Co., by his mistress of Abyssinian descent called Sofia. The name Bamba was Arabic for pink. Her father already had a wife and he therefore placed his illegitimate daughter in the care of missionaries in Cairo. Her father had requested and paid for her education, and remained in contact with the missionaries. M\u00fcller became an enthusiastic and charismatic member of the Christian community and was the only female in a select group of communicants at the American Presbyterian Mission school in Cairo. The prince\nDuleep Singh was the last ruler of the Sikh Empire, being dethroned by the East India Company after the Second Anglo-Sikh War. In 1863, Singh was being supervised in Britain where he was a friend of Queen Victoria and kept a large social circle. He was known as the \"Black Prince of Perthshire\" around his home in Scotland. Singh was given money by the East India Company administration on condition that he complied with the demands of the British government. Duleep had been taken to Britain when a child and raised as a Christian. This was after he had been persuaded to agree to the annexation of the Punjab by the East India Company. The treaty also included handing the Koh-i-Nor diamond as well, which became part of the Crown Jewels. Singh was separated from his mother, Maharani Jindan Kaur. His mother remained in India, although eventually she was allowed to rejoin her son in England. Duleep collected her after special permission was given."

      "Passage 1:\nAugust Underground's Mordum\nAugust Underground's Mordum is a 2003 direct-to-video horror exploitation film  created and distributed by Toetag Pictures. It is the sequel to 2001's August Underground, and was followed by August Underground's Penance in 2007. The film is purposely shot in an amateur way to pass off the film as a faux snuff film. Plot\nMordum is a home movie shot by serial killers Peter Mountain, his sadomasochistic girlfriend, Crusty, and her depraved man-child brother, Maggot. After Peter walks in on Crusty and Maggot having sex, an argument erupts between him and Crusty. It is quelled when Crusty sexually arouses Peter and herself via self-mutilation with a piece of glass. The two then break into a crack house, where Peter beats the owner to death with a hammer. Crusty films the filth-encrusted building and the decaying corpse of an overdosed addict. When Peter starts stripping the body of the house's owner, claiming it will be easier to dispose of without clothes, another fight breaks out between him and Crusty when she questions his motive for undressing the body, accusing him of being \"a faggot. \"\nCrusty demonstrates her love of self-harm to Maggot and a friend, cutting her scarred arm with a knife. Crusty and Maggot remove a bound and masked woman from a box they have been keeping her in for \"a long time.\" Maggot rapes the woman while Crusty cheers him on and taunts the victim. When Maggot is finished, he then lets a male captive out of another box, and he and Crusty force him to perform a penectomy on himself with a pair of cuticle scissors, then seal him back up. Crusty mimics oral sex with it, then uses it to violate the female victim. The trio of killers go to town, where they torment a shopkeeper, eat fast food, and wander around. Maggot and Peter then watch and masturbate to Crusty torturing two women, sexually abusing and repeatedly vomiting on them while a male corpse rots in the corner of the room. Eventually, the women are killed. Maggot disembowels one, chewing on her spilled innards and masturbating with them, while the other is beaten to death by Crusty and Peter, the latter dragging the body away to presumably have sex with it.",
      "External links\nConey Island Baby (2006) at IMDb\nMSN - Movies: Coney Island Baby\nPassage 3:\nAugust Underground\nAugust Underground is a 2001 American exploitation horror film directed by Fred Vogel, and written by Vogel and Allen Peters. The film stars Vogel as a serial killer named Peter, who kidnaps and kills several innocent people, while his unnamed accomplice, played by Peters, films and documents the murders. Filmed in an intentionally amateurish found footage style, August Underground was met with mixed reviews. The film was followed by two sequels, August Underground's Mordum in 2003, and August Underground's Penance in 2007. Plot\nPeter, a serial killer, invites his camera-wielding friend into his basement, where he is holding a woman named Laura captive. Peter and his accomplice torture her at their leisure, committing sadistic acts such as slicing one of her nipples off and covering her in feces and urine. Next, the two pick up a female hitchhiker. After Peter coerces her into performing oral sex, he beats and leaves her for dead on the side of the road. After the duo are kicked out of a concert for rowdy behavior, Peter and his accomplice return to the house to find that Laura has died. Peter murders an old woman in her home, then terrorizes a convenience store with his accomplice. They abandon their plans to kidnap the clerk or a shopper when they hear police sirens approaching. The two then proceed to tour Roadside America, and visit a tattoo parlor. When the tattoo artist finishes giving Peter a tattoo, he and his twin brother are captured by Peter and the cameraman. They cut a leg off of the tattoo artist then bludgeon him and his brother to death. The two hire prostitutes for a drug-fueled orgy. Peter sodomizes one prostitute while beating her with a hammer. The remaining prostitute tries to escape. In the chaotic chase that ensues, the accomplice drops the camera, leading to silence in the room.

      "It is the sequel to 2003's August Underground's Mordum, and the final installment in the August Underground series, which began in 2001. Plot\nAugust Underground's Penance continues the series' narrative mode of showing the lives of serial killers (now just Peter, and his girlfriend Crusty) through their camera, though this installment abandons the \"degraded footage\" aspect employed by the first two films, being shot in high-definition. After killing a man who breaks free of his restraints and tries to escape them, Peter and Crusty visit various locations in town and enjoy some fireworks at a celebration. Peter is then shown in his basement, taunting a semi-conscious man who has had nails hammered into various parts of his body. Next, Peter and Crusty go on a hike, assault a vagrant they find sleeping under a bridge, and cut a man open so they can pull his gurgling intestines out. The two then attend a party, where Peter does drugs, Crusty flirts with other women, and a live rat is fed to a pet alligator. Around Christmas, Peter and Crusty break into a family's home. Peter bludgeons the father with a hammer and suffocates the mother, whom he is unsuccessful in trying to rape due to being unable to attain an erection. When the dead couple's young daughter stumbles onto the two intruders, Crusty strangles her. While Peter goes to shower, Crusty opens some of the family's presents, then falls asleep beside the corpses of the little girl and her mother. Later, while watching a band perform, Crusty goes to an empty room with a man, with whom she has rough anal sex. Back in the basement, Peter and Crusty torture and murder several people they have imprisoned. Afterward, they take apart a dead deer, and with a friend's help, feed pieces of it to a lion. The two then enjoy several recreational activities, like shooting on a makeshift firing range, and racing ATVs. As Peter beats a man to death with a hammer, Crusty drinks some of the spilled blood, then helps Peter dismember a female body."

      "School Governor\nHe was a governor of Rivington Grammar School during the Commonwealth and after Restoration from 1650 until 1691. The school lacked income between 1650 and 1660 so Thomas travelled to London, York and Durham for affidavits and trials and secured the rental income for the school. In the school's records he is noted as Gentleman of Horwich. He served as Chairman of Governors in 1651, 1653\u201354, 1653, 1670, 1676 and 1683. Succession\nThomas was called to parliament by writ 19 May 1685  subsequent to there being no other heir known at the time of the death of his cousin, Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1679. He was called to parliament as the 11th Baron Willoughby of Parham 1547 creation, however, the writ had created a new Barony and with it a new title of 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham (1685 creation).The title would have been inherited by Henry Willoughby, grandson of Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and great-grandson of Charles, the 2nd Baron. However, Henry Willoughby had emigrated to Virginia and his whereabouts was not known. The right to the first barony created by letters patent in 1547 was later claimed by a descendant of Henry Willoughby as 16th Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1767. Death\nThomas died in 1691 aged 89 and was buried under the chancel by the east window at the old Horwich Parish Church. Thomas was succeeded by his eldest son Hugh as the 12th Baron Willoughby of Parham, 2nd Baron of the 1685 creation. Passage 3:\nCharles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham\nCharles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham (c.1536/7 \u2013 d. 1610\u201312) was the only son of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, and Elizabeth Heneage. Family\nCharles Willoughby, born about 1536/7, was the only son of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, Suffolk, and his first wife, Elizabeth Heneage, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire, by Katherine Skipwith, daughter of Sir John Skipwith of Ormsby. Career\nWilloughby matriculated at St. John's College, Cambridge at Easter, 1549.",
      "His half-brother John Walton attended Glasgow University in 1736 and during the adult life of Hugh Willoughby all the Ministers at the Rivington Unitarian Chapel were from that University. His mother Ester Walton was interred at Horwich Parish Church on 16 Jan 1761. Succession\nIn 1733, Hugh Willoughby was challenged by a rival claimant to the peerage, Henry Willoughby, a descendant of Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and the case was referred to the Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Sir Philip York (later Lord Hardwicke) championed Hugh Willoughby's cause. As Henry Willoughby awaited his hearing, Hugh Willoughby spent his time travelling in Europe, his absence prevented the case being heard. However, on his return the case from Henry Willoughby was still not attended to by Hugh Willoughby or the Attorney General. Hugh Willoughby gained a writ of summons to the House of Lords and took his seat on 1 February 1734, despite a caveat: his rival's petition was read to the house. House of Lords\nIn his first year, he attended the Lords without missing a session. In the years 1735 to 1739, he was noted for his non-attendance, then after 1742 attended without fail. In addition to his duties in the Lords he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Society in 1752 and President of the Society of Antiquaries in 1754. Other positions included Vice-President of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, Trustee for the British Museum and a Commissioner on the Board of Longitude. From 1758 until 1762 he was governor at Rivington Grammar School and was a trustee of Blackrod Grammar School from 1736 although he did not attend meetings. He aided the foundation of the Warrington Academy. Hugh Willoughby chaired a committee of the House of Lords a year after taking his seat. Philip Yorke wrote that Willoughby was \"eminently useful in the dispatch of the ordinary business\" of the Lords, and \"had a thorough and accurate knowledge of the forms and usage of Parliament\". He played a significant role in committee work between 1739\u201340.",

He died without a male heir on 9 December 1679. The first creation by letters patent stipulated the title must pass to heirs male of Sir William Willoughby 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham. Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham died without issue and left his estate to his niece Elizabeth, who had married James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Second Creation\nOn the death of the 10th Lord Willoughby, the title should have passed to the line of the next son of Charles 2nd Lord Willoughby, who was Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and then through his line to the eldest son, Edward Willoughby, and then Henry; however the family had emigrated to Virginia and it was believed this male line was extinct. The title passed instead through the line of Thomas the youngest son of Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham and his sons to Thomas Willoughby, who had married Eleanor Whittle, daughter of Hugh Whittle, a staunch Presbyterian yeoman of Horwich, Lancashire, England. The Writ of Summons by the monarch to the hereditary peerage in parliament of the successor created a second Barony of Parham in fee and inheritable by his heirs general. Passage 9:\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham (1612\u20131617) was an English peer of the House of Lords. He was born in about November 1612, the son of William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham, and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland. On the death of his father in 1617, he succeeded as the 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham. However, he did not enjoy the title long, dying in infancy on about 14 October 1617. The barony was succeeded by his brother, Francis Willoughby.

      "Henry died in Hull Creek, Virginia on 26 November 1685, aged 59. His son, also Henry, was then aged 20. Henry married Elizabeth, daughter of William Pigeon of Stepney, with whom he had a son who was also named Henry. Henry Willoughby had twice been master of the Company of Brewers in London, a Justice of the Peace and colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Militia of the Tower Hamlets. Henry Willoughby married Susannah, daughter Robert Gresswell of Middlesex and had a daughter, Elizabeth who married John Halsey of Tower Hill. Henry Willoughby first petitioned for his seat in the House of Lords in 1733, his case was not heard. His petition was accepted after the death of Hugh Willoughby, 15th Baron Willoughby of Parham and he took his seat on 25 April 1767 to become the 16th baron. Henry Willoughby died on 29 January 1775, aged 79, without male heir and the title passed to his nephew.

However, a few months later he died without issue in September 1678. The barony was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles Willoughby. Passage 8:\nCharles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nCharles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham was an English peer of the House of Lords. He succeeded to the title in September 1678 on the death of John Willoughby, 9th Baron Willoughby of Parham.

      "He was commissioned captain of an independent troop of horse raised to suppress the Monmouth Rebellion on 20 June 1685. In 1688, Bertie took part in the northern rising led by his kinsman, the Earl of Danby, in favour of William of Orange. He was rewarded with the chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1689, a post which enabled him to secure a seat at Preston at the general election of 1690.In 1690, he was returned for Preston, but was soon forced to leave the House of Commons for the House of Lords after receiving a writ of acceleration as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Lord Willougby inherited the earldom of Lindsey on his father's death in 1701, and was invested a Privy Counsellor one month later; along with the Earldom of Lindsey, he also inherited the offices of Lord Great Chamberlain and Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, both of which he would hold until his death and would pass onto his son, the 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Lord Lindsey, as he was now styled, was then created Marquess of Lindsey in 1706, and was finally created Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715, with a special remainder failing the heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of the body of his father, Robert, late Earl of Lindsey, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Philip, Lord Wharton. Also in 1715, he temporarily served as a Lord Justice. In 1715, he employed Sir John Vanbrugh to design a baroque front to his house at Grimsthorpe to celebrate his ennoblement as first Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Personal life\nOn 30 July 1678, Lord Willoughby married Mary Wynn (d. 1689), a Welsh heiress and direct descendant of the princely house of Aberffraw. She was the daughter, and sole heiress, of Sir Richard Wynn, 4th Baronet of Gwydyr Estate and the former Sarah Myddelton (daughter of Sir Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle).

      "Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1547 and was the last male heir of the eldest line. Charles Willoughby married Marie daughter of Sir Beaumont Dixie, Bart of Bosworth. He died without a male heir on 9 December 1679. The first creation by letters patent stipulated the title must pass to heirs male of Sir William Willoughby 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham. Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham died without issue and left his estate to his niece Elizabeth, who had married James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Second Creation\nOn the death of the 10th Lord Willoughby, the title should have passed to the line of the next son of Charles 2nd Lord Willoughby, who was Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and then through his line to the eldest son, Edward Willoughby, and then Henry; however the family had emigrated to Virginia and it was believed this male line was extinct. The title passed instead through the line of Thomas the youngest son of Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham and his sons to Thomas Willoughby, who had married Eleanor Whittle, daughter of Hugh Whittle, a staunch Presbyterian yeoman of Horwich, Lancashire, England. The Writ of Summons by the monarch to the hereditary peerage in parliament of the successor created a second Barony of Parham in fee and inheritable by his heirs general. Passage 9:\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham (1612\u20131617) was an English peer of the House of Lords. He was born in about November 1612, the son of William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham, and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland. On the death of his father in 1617, he succeeded as the 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham. However, he did not enjoy the title long, dying in infancy on about 14 October 1617. The barony was succeeded by his brother, Francis Willoughby. Passage 10:\nWilliam Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nWilliam Willoughby, 6th Lord Willoughby (c. 1616 \u2013 10 April 1673) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons and later in the House of Lords.",
      "He succeeded to the title at his father's death on 30 July 1570. He held administrative offices in Lincolnshire, and was one of the commissioners who tried Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel, for treason on 14 April 1589.Willoughby died between October 1610 and 26 October 1612. He was predeceased by his eldest son and heir, William, and the title passed to William's eldest son, who succeeded as 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham. The 3rd Baron's male heirs held the barony until Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham (6 October 1650 \u2013 9 December 1679), died without issue on 9 December 1679, when the title should have passed to the descendants of Sir Ambrose Willoughby, second son of the 2nd Baron. However Sir Ambrose Willoughby's descendants had emigrated to Virginia, and it was thought his male line was extinct. In consequence, the barony was wrongfully allowed to Thomas Willoughby (c.1602 \u2013 29 February 1692), the fifth and youngest son of the 2nd Baron. Charles Willoughby left his estate to his niece Elizabeth, who had married James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon, ancestor of the present Earl of Abingdon. Marriage and issue\nWilloughby married Margaret Clinton. Margaret was the third daughter of Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln, Lord High Admiral of England, by his first wife, Elizabeth Blount, the eldest daughter of Sir John Blount of Kinlet, Shropshire. Before marrying the Earl of Lincoln, Elizabeth Blount had been the wife of Gilbert Tailboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme (died 15 April 1530). She was at one time the mistress of King Henry VIII, by whom she was the mother of his illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset. By Margaret Clinton Willoughby had five sons, William, Sir Ambrose, Edward, Charles and Thomas, and three daughters, Katherine, Margaret and Anne. The eldest five, William, Ambrose, Edward, Katherine and Margaret, were named in the will of their grandmother, Katherine Skipwith, on 10 January 1572, and were all under 20 years of age at that time.",
      "Henry died in Hull Creek, Virginia on 26 November 1685, aged 59. His son, also Henry, was then aged 20.

Henry Willoughby died on 29 January 1775, aged 79, without male heir and the title passed to his nephew.

      "D) Marie Louise's marriage to Napoleon was celebrated with great pomp and circumstance in Vienna."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "He \"spared no pains\" to please her and claimed at one point to prefer Marie Louise to his first wife Jos\u00e9phine; while he had loved Jos\u00e9phine, and though he claimed Jos\u00e9phine remained his greatest friend even after their amicable divorce, he had not respected her, whereas with Marie Louise, there was \"Never a lie, never a debt\" \u2014 presumably a reference to Jos\u00e9phine's rumoured extramarital affairs and reputation as a spendthrift. Marie Louise wrote to her father: \"I assure you, dear papa, that people have done great injustice to the Emperor. The better one knows him, the better one appreciates and loves him.\" However, the marriage was not without tension; Napoleon sometimes remarked to aides that Marie Louise was too shy and timid, compared to the outgoing and passionate Josephine, with whom he remained in close contact, upsetting Marie Louise. The excitement surrounding the wedding ushered in a period of peace and friendship between France and Austria, who had been largely at war for the last two decades. The people of Vienna, who hated Napoleon only months before, were suddenly in full praise of the French Emperor. Flattering letters were sent between Napoleon and Emperor Francis, Empress Maria Ludovika Beatrix and Archduke Charles during the wedding festivities. During public occasions, Marie Louise spoke little due to reserve and timidity, which some observers mistook for haughtiness. She was regarded as a virtuous woman and never interfered in politics. Privately, she was polite and gentle. Napoleon arranged for Marie Louise to participate in some carefully selected charity assignments, most notably the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Charit\u00e9 Maternelle, for which he made her Honorary President. Birth of first child\nMarie Louise became pregnant by July 1810 and gave birth to a son on 20 March 1811. The boy, Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, was given the title King of Rome, in accordance with the practice where the heir apparent to the Holy Roman Empire was called the King of the Romans.",
      "Their journey was hampered by bad weather, and they arrived in Buda \"wet through, and nearly worn out with fatigue\". Marriage proposal\nAfter escaping an assassination attempt in Vienna, while negotiating the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn on 12 October 1809, Emperor Napoleon decided that he needed an heir to cement his relatively young Empire. He also sought the validation and legitimization of his Empire by marrying a member of one of the leading royal families of Europe. He began proceedings to divorce Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, who did not bear him a son, and began searching for a new empress. His wish to marry Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia, the youngest sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, caused alarm in Austria, who were afraid of being sandwiched between two great powers allied with each other. At the persuasion of Prince Metternich, a marriage between Napoleon and Marie Louise was suggested by Emperor Francis to the Count of Narbonne but no official overture was made by the Austrians. Though officials in Paris and Austria were beginning to accept the possibility of the union, Marie Louise was kept uninformed of developments. Frustrated by the Russians delaying the marriage negotiations, Napoleon rescinded his proposal in late January 1810 and began negotiations to marry Marie Louise with the Austrian ambassador, the Prince of Schwarzenberg. Schwarzenberg signed the marriage contract on 7 February. Marie Louise was informed of the marriage by Metternich. When asked for consent, she replied: \"I wish only what my duty commands me to wish. \"\n\nWedding\nMarie Louise was married by proxy to Napoleon on 11 March 1810 at the Augustinian Church, Vienna. Napoleon was represented by Archduke Charles, the bride's uncle. According to the French ambassador, the marriage \"was celebrated with a magnificence that it would be hard to surpass, by the side of which even the brilliant festivities that have preceded it are not to be mentioned\". She became Empress of the French and Queen of Italy. Marie Louise departed Vienna on 13 March, probably expecting never to return.",
      "Napoleon was delighted that his wife survived the ordeal and said: \"I had rather never have any more children than see her suffer so much again. \"Marie Louise was devoted to her son; she had him brought to her every morning and visited him in his apartment in the course of the day. Resumption of war\nIn May 1812, a month before the French invasion of Russia, Marie Louise accompanied Napoleon to Dresden, where she met her father and stepmother. Emperor Francis told Napoleon he could count on Austria for the \"triumph of the common cause\", a reference to the impending war. A minor rivalry began to develop between Marie Louise and the Empress of Austria, who was jealous at being upstaged in appearance by her stepdaughter. It was also in Dresden where she met Count Adam Albert von Neipperg for the first time. Napoleon left Dresden on 29 May to take charge of his army. Marie Louise then travelled to Prague, where she spent a few weeks with the Austrian Imperial family, before returning to Saint Cloud on 18 July. She kept in touch with Napoleon throughout the war. The invasion of Russia ended disastrously for France. More than half of the Grande Arm\u00e9e was destroyed by the Russian Winter and guerrilla attacks. After the failed Malet coup of October 1812, Napoleon hastened his return to France and reunited with his wife on the night of 18 December. Collapse of the Empire\nThe weakened French position triggered the Sixth Coalition. Prussia allied with Russia and declared war on France (the United Kingdom was already at war with France), but Austria stayed out due to relations between the Imperial families. On 30 March, Marie Louise was appointed Regent as Napoleon set off for battle in Germany. The regency was only de jure, as all decisions were still taken by Napoleon and implemented by his most senior officials, including Lebrun, Joseph Bonaparte, Talleyrand and Savary. Marie Louise tried unsuccessfully to get her father to ally with France. Austria too joined the opposition to France. She maintained a correspondence with Napoleon, informing him of increasing demands for peace in Paris and the provinces.",
      "On 16 April, her father arrived at Blois to meet her. At the advice of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise departed Rambouillet with her son for Vienna on 23 April. At Vienna, she stayed at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, where she received frequent visits from her sisters, but rarely from her father and stepmother. She met her grandmother, Maria Carolina, who disapproved of her deserting her husband. Distressed at being seen as a heartless wife and indifferent mother, she wrote on 9 August 1814: \"I am in a very unhappy and critical position; I must be very prudent in my conduct. There are moments when that thought so distracts me that I think that the best thing I could do would be to die. \"\n\nCongress of Vienna and relationship with Neipperg\nIn the summer of 1814, Emperor Francis sent Count Adam Albert von Neipperg to accompany Marie Louise to the spa town of Aix-les-Bains to prevent her from joining Napoleon on Elba. Neipperg was a confidant of Metternich and an enemy of Napoleon. Marie Louise fell in love with Neipperg. They became lovers. He became her chamberlain, and her advocate at the Congress of Vienna. News of the relationship was not received well by the French and the Austrian public. When Napoleon escaped in March 1815 and reinstated his rule, the Allies once again declared war. Marie Louise was asked by her stepmother to join in the processions to pray for the success of the Austrian armies but rejected the insulting invitation. She passed a message to Napoleon's private secretary, Claude Fran\u00e7ois de M\u00e9neval, who was about to return to France: \"I hope he will understand the misery of my position ... I shall never assent to a divorce, but I flatter myself that he will not oppose an amicable separation, and that he will not bear any ill feeling towards me ... This separation has become imperative; it will in no way affect the feelings of esteem and gratitude that I preserve.\" Napoleon was defeated for the last time at the Battle of Waterloo and was exiled to Saint Helena from October 1815. Napoleon made no further attempt to contact her personally.",
      "She was named after her grandmother, Marie Louise, Holy Roman Empress. Her father became Holy Roman Emperor a year later as Francis II. Marie Louise was a great-granddaughter of Empress Maria Theresa through both her parents, as they were double first cousins. She was also a maternal granddaughter of Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, Marie Antoinette's favorite sister. Marie Louise's formative years were during a period of conflict between France and her family. She was brought up to detest France and French ideas. Her upbringing was supervised by her French imperial governess Victoire de Folliot de Crenneville. Marie Louise was influenced by her grandmother Maria Carolina, who despised the French Revolution which ultimately caused the death of her sister, Marie Antoinette. Maria Carolina's Kingdom of Naples had also come into direct conflict with French forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The War of the Third Coalition brought Austria to the brink of ruin, which increased Marie Louise's resentment towards Napoleon. The Imperial family was forced to flee Vienna in 1805. Marie Louise took refuge in Hungary and later Galicia before returning to Vienna in 1806. Her father relinquished the title of Holy Roman Emperor but remained Emperor of Austria. To make her more marriageable, her parents had her tutored in many languages. In addition to her native German, she became fluent in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. In 1807, when Marie Louise was 15, her mother died after suffering a miscarriage. Less than a year later, Emperor Francis married his first cousin Maria Ludovika Beatrix of Austria-Este, who was four years older than Marie Louise. Nonetheless, Maria Ludovika Beatrix took on a maternal role towards her stepdaughter. She was also bitter towards the French, who had deprived her father of the Duchy of Modena. Another war broke out between France and Austria in 1809, which resulted in defeat for the Austrians again. The Imperial family had to flee Vienna again before the city surrendered on 12 May."

    "documentation": [
      "An important source for \"Sargonic heroes\" in oral tradition in the later Bronze Age is a Middle Hittite (15th century BC) record of a Hurro-Hittite song, which calls upon Sargon and his immediate successors as \"deified kings\" (d\u0161arrena).Sargon shared his name with two later Mesopotamian kings. Sargon I was a king of the Old Assyrian period presumably named after Sargon of Akkad. Sargon II was a Neo-Assyrian king named after Sargon of Akkad; it is this king whose name was rendered Sargon (\u05e1\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d2\u05d5\u05b9\u05df) in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 20:1). Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus showed great interest in the history of the Sargonid dynasty and even conducted excavations of Sargon's palaces and those of his successors. In popular culture\nThe fanciful adventure film The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior (2008) imagines Sargon of Akkad as a murderous army commander wielding black magic. He is the film's main villain, portrayed by Randy Couture. The twentieth episode of the second season of Star Trek: The Original Series, \"Return to Tomorrow\", features an ancient, telepathic alien named Sargon who once ruled a mighty empire. American Rock Group They Might Be Giants refer to Sargon of Akkad in the track \"The Mesopotamians\" on their 2007 album The Else, along with Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh. Carl Benjamin, British far-right YouTuber and political commentator, goes by the online pseudonym \"Sargon of Akkad\" on his YouTube channel. The Return of Rome expansion pack for the video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition features a campaign called \"Sargon of Akkad\", which depicts his conquest of Sumer and the rise of the Akkadian Empire. See also\nMedia related to Sargon of Akkad at Wikimedia Commons\nHistory of Mesopotamia\nList of kings of Akkad\nList of Mesopotamian dynasties\n\nNotes\nPassage 7: Sennedjem\nSennedjem was an Ancient Egyptian artisan who was active during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. He lived in Set Maat (translated as \"The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el-Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes.",
      "An older version of the king list gives Sargon's reign as lasting for 40 years. Thorkild Jacobsen marked the clause about Sargon's father being a gardener as a lacuna, indicating his uncertainty about its meaning. Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but separated by several additional named rulers of Kish, who seem to have been merely governors or vassals under the Akkadian Empire. The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has been called into question with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of Enshakushanna, who almost certainly preceded him. The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19:51) states that it was Sargon who \"built Babylon in front of Akkad.\" The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20:18\u201319) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon \"dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade.\" Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than to Sargon of Akkad. Some of the regnal year names of Sargon are preserved, and throw some light in the events of his reign, particularly the conquest of the surrounding territories of Simurrum, Elam and Mari, and Uru'a, thought to be a city in Elam: Year in which Sargon went to Simurrum\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Uru'a\nYear in which Uru'a was destroyed\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Elam\nYear in which Mari was destroyed\n\nHistoriography\nLanguage and script used in records\nSargon appears to have promoted the use of Semitic (Akkadian) in inscriptions. He frequently calls himself \"king of Akkad\" first, after he apparently founded the city of Akkad. He appears to have taken over the rule of Kish at some point, and later also much of Mesopotamia, referring to himself as\n\"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". During Sargon's reign, East Semitic was standardized and adapted for use with the cuneiform script previously used in the Sumerian language into what is now known as the \"Akkadian language\".",
      "The form \u0160arru-uk\u012bn was known from the Assyrian Sargon Legend discovered in 1867 in Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. A contemporary reference to Sargon thought to have been found on the cylinder seal of Ibni-sharru, a high-ranking official serving under Sargon. Joachim Menant published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as Shegani-shar-lukh, and did not yet identify it with \"Sargon the Elder\" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king Sargon I). In 1883, the British Museum acquired the \"mace-head of Shar-Gani-sharri\", a votive gift deposited at the temple of Shamash in Sippar. This \"Shar-Gani\" was identified with the Sargon of Agade of Assyrian legend. The identification of \"Shar-Gani-sharri\" with Sargon was recognised as mistaken in the 1910s. Shar-Gani-sharri (Shar-Kali-Sharri) is, in fact, Sargon's great-grandson, the successor of Naram-Sin. It is not entirely clear whether the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II was directly named for Sargon of Akkad, as there is some uncertainty whether his name should be rendered \u0160arru-uk\u012bn or as \u0160arru-k\u0113n(u). Chronology\nPrimary sources pertaining to Sargon are sparse; the main near-contemporary reference is that in the various versions of the Sumerian King List. Here, Sargon is mentioned as the son of a gardener, former cup-bearer of Ur-Zababa of Kish. He usurped the kingship from Lugal-zage-si of Uruk and took it to his own city of Akkad. Note that the Weidner chronicle has Sargon ruling directly after Ur-Zababa and does not mention Lugal-zage-si. Various copies of the king list give the duration of his reign as either 40 or 54-56 years. Numerous fragmentary inscriptions relating to Sargon are also known. In absolute years, his reign would correspond to c. 2334\u20132279 BC in the middle chronology. His successors until the Gutian conquest of Sumer are also known as the \"Sargonic Dynasty\" and their rule as the \"Sargonic Period\" of Mesopotamian history. Foster (1982) argued that the reading of 55 years as the duration of Sargon's reign was, in fact, a corruption of an original interpretation of 37 years.",
      "He is sometimes identified as the first person in recorded history to rule over an empire. He was the founder of the \"Sargonic\" or \"Old Akkadian\" dynasty, which ruled for about a century after his death until the Gutian conquest of Sumer. The Sumerian king list makes him the cup-bearer to king Ur-Zababa of Kish. His empire is thought to have included most of Mesopotamia, parts of the Levant, besides incursions into Hurrian and Elamite territory, ruling from his (archaeologically as yet unidentified) capital, Akkad. Sargon appears as a legendary figure in Neo-Assyrian literature of the 8th to 7th centuries BC. Tablets with fragments of a Sargon Birth Legend were found in the Library of Ashurbanipal. Name\nThe Akkadian name is normalized as either \u0160arru-uk\u012bn or \u0160arru-k\u0113n. The name's cuneiform spelling is variously LUGAL-\u00fa-kin, \n\u0161ar-ru-gen6, \u0161ar-ru-ki-in, \u0161ar-ru-um-ki-in. In Old Babylonian tablets relating the legends of Sargon, his name is transcribed as \ud808\udeac\ud808\ude92\ud808\udf1d\ud808\udd00\ud808\udd54 (\u0160ar-ru-um-ki-in). In Late Assyrian references, the name is mostly spelled as LUGAL-GI.NA or LUGAL-GIN, i.e. identical to the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II. The spelling Sargon is derived from the single mention of the name (in reference to Sargon II) in the Hebrew Bible, as \u05e1\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d2\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, in Isaiah 20:1. The first element in the name is \u0161arru, the Akkadian (East Semitic) for \"king\" (c.f. Hebrew \u015bar \u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05e8). The second element is derived from the verb k\u012bnum \"to confirm, establish\" (related to Hebrew k\u016bn \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05df).A possible interpretation of the reading \u0160arru-uk\u012bn is \"the king has established (stability)\" or \"he [the god] has established the king\". Such a name would however be unusual; other names in -uk\u012bn always include both a subject and an object, as in \u0160ama\u0161-\u0161uma-uk\u012bn \"Shamash has established an heir\". There is some debate over whether the name was an adopted regnal name or a birth name. The reading \u0160arru-k\u0113n has been interpreted adjectivally, as \"the king is established; legitimate\", expanded as a phrase \u0161arrum ki(e)num. The terms \"Pre-Sargonic\" and \"Post-Sargonic\" were used in Assyriology based on the chronologies of Nabonidus before the historical existence of Sargon of Akkad was confirmed.",
      "A style of calligraphy developed in which text on clay tablets and cylinder seals was arranged amidst scenes of mythology and ritual. Year names\nWhile various copies of the Sumerian king list and later Babylonian chronicles credit Sargon with a reign length ranging from 34 to 56 years, dated documents have been found for only four different year-names of his actual reign. The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum (a Hurrian region), and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state). Nippur inscription\nAmong the most important sources for Sargon's reign is a tablet of the Old Babylonian period recovered at Nippur in the University of Pennsylvania expedition in the 1890s. The tablet is a copy of the inscriptions on the pedestal of a statue erected by Sargon in the temple of Enlil. Its text was edited by Arno Poebel (1909) and Leon Legrain (1926). Conquest of Sumer\nIn the inscription, Sargon styles himself \"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer (mashkim) of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed (guda) of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". It celebrates the conquest of Uruk and the defeat of Lugalzagesi, whom Sargon brought \"in a collar to the gate of Enlil\":\nSargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land, governor of Enlil: he defeated the city of Uruk and tore down its walls, in the battle of Uruk he won, took Lugalzagesi king of Uruk in the course of the battle, and led him in a collar to the gate of Enlil. Sargon then conquered Ur and E-Ninmar and \"laid waste\" the territory from Lagash to the sea, and from there went on to conquer and destroy Umma:\nSargon, king of Agade, was victorious over Ur in battle, conquered the city and destroyed its wall. He conquered Eninmar, destroyed its walls, and conquered its district and Lagash as far as the sea. He washed his weapons in the sea. He was victorious over Umma in battle, [conquered the city, and destroyed its walls]. [To Sargon], lo[rd] of the land the god Enlil"

      "Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramstr\u00f6m were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber.

      "Succession scandal\nThe King, claiming to be sexually inexperienced, called upon Munck to help him with a reconciliation with his spouse, instruct the couple in the ways of sexual intercourse, and physically show them how to consummate their marriage. Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramstr\u00f6m were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber.

      "In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned. In 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,:\u200a191\u200a as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual.

A child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince. Queen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.:\u200a443\u200a As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles.",

Directly after she was told of the attack, Sophia Magdalena sent for the king's favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took the hands of the King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: \"How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!\" She was kept informed of his state by Armfelt, but she was prevented from further visits because Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because of the smell from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room."

The specimens in the Templeton collection in the Ulster Museum (BEL) have been catalogued. Those noted in 1967 were numbered: F1 \u2013 F48. Others were in The Queen's University Belfast.

Templeton was the first finder of Rosa hibernicaThis rose, although collected by Templeton in 1795, remained undescribed until 1803 when he published a short diagnosis in the Transactions of the Dublin Society. Early additions to the flora of Ireland include Sisymbrium Ligusticum seoticum (1793), Adoxa moschatellina (1820), Orobanche rubra and many other plants. His work on lichens was the basis of this secton of Flora Hiberica by James Townsend Mackay who wrote of him The foregoing account of the Lichens of Ireland would have been still more incomplete, but for the extensive collection of my lamented friend, the late Mr. John Templeton, of Cranmore, near Belfast, which his relict, Mrs. Templeton, most liberally placed at my disposal. I believe that thirty years ago his acquirements in the Natural History of organised beings rivalled that of any individual in Europe : these were by no means limited to diagnostic marks, but extended to all the laws and modifications of the living force. The frequent quotation of his authority in every preceding department of this Flora, is but a brief testimony of his diversified knowledge\n\nBotanical Manuscripts\nThe MSS. left by Templeton consist of seven volumes.

They are now lent to the Belfast Museum. About ten years ago I [Lett]spent a week in examining these volumes, and as their contents have hitherto never been fully described, I would like to give an epitome of my investigation of them.

Vol.IIl.\u2014Marine Algae, 212 folios, of which 79 are coloured figures. At the end of this volume are 3 folios of Mosses, the pagination of which runs with the rest of this volume, but it is evident they had at some time been misplaced. Vol. IV Fungi, 112 folios. Vol. V.\u2014Mosses, 117 folios, of which 20 are coloured, and also 73 small drawings in the text. *Vol. VI.\u2014Mosses and Hepatics. 117 folios are Hepatics, 40 of which are in colours ; 96 folios are Mosses, of which 39 are full-page coloured figures; and in addition there are 3 small coloured drawings in the text. All these drawings were executed by Templeton himself, they are every one most accurately and beautifully drawn; and the colouring is true to nature and artistically finished; those of the mosses and hepatics being particularly good. Templeton is not mentioned in Tate\u2019s \u2018\u2018 Flora Belfastiensis,\u2019 published in 1863, at Belfast."

      "In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned. In 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,:\u200a191\u200a as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual. In 1787, Sophia Magdalena deposited a sum of 50.000 riksdaler in an account for Munck, which was generally rumoured to be a \"farewell gift\".: 156\u20137\u200a  At this point, Munck had started an affair with the ballerina Giovanna Bassi, to whom Sophia Magdalena showed great dislike.: 157\u200a  The King was terrified when he heard that the Queen had made that deposit, and he tried to prevent the transaction from becoming public knowledge, which, however, did not succeed.: 157\u200a Munck was, however, continued to be used as a go-between and a messenger between the King and the Queen, especially during conflicts. A child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince. Queen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.:\u200a443\u200a As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles.",
      "To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber.

A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,:\u200a191\u200a as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual.

Directly after she was told of the attack, Sophia Magdalena sent for the king's favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took the hands of the King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: \"How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!\" She was kept informed of his state by Armfelt, but she was prevented from further visits because Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because of the smell from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room.",
      "Munck and Ramstr\u00f6m were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber. Munck himself writes in his written account, which is preserved at the National Archives of Sweden, that to succeed, he was obliged to touch them both physically. When it became known that Munck participated in the reconciliation between the royal couple, there were rumours that he was the father of Sophia Magdalena's firstborn. These became the subject of accusations from the political opposition, as late as in 1786 and 1789,:\u200a132\u200a where it was claimed that the whole nation was aware of the rumour that the King had asked Munck to make the Queen pregnant.:\u200a118\u200a Pamphlets to that end were posted on street corners all over Stockholm.: 143 This was also caricatured by Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd in private letters discovered later \u2013 his drawing was published in 1987 \u2014, where he passed on a number of rumors and jokes about Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena and Munck without inferring that he believed they were true. There was also a rumour that the King and Queen had divorced in secret and that the Queen had married Munck. There is no proof that Munck was the father of the crown prince. Erik L\u00f6nnroth has suggested that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image. A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schr\u00f6derheim and Eva Helena L\u00f6wen. The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".:\u200a103\u20134\u200aThe Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked.",
      "Countess Hj\u00e4rne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant, \"And the riksr\u00e5d Ribbing is her favorite.\"The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman, that: \"information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen\". Her contact with Rosencrone is said to have been restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors. In 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, and Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own. In 1778, Sophia Magdalena gave birth to Gustav Adolf, successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, Charles Gustav, who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila, then Riksstallm\u00e4stare. This rumor was believed by elements of the public and the royal court, and her acquiescence to it led to a year-long break between the Queen Dowager and her son. Succession scandal\nThe King, claiming to be sexually inexperienced, called upon Munck to help him with a reconciliation with his spouse, instruct the couple in the ways of sexual intercourse, and physically show them how to consummate their marriage. Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramstr\u00f6m, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen."

    "documentation": [
      "She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse. As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation \u2013 more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. Sophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von H\u00f6pken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day. In the famous diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as \"Forced to meet people\".",

      "The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party. Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award.

She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history. She educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian, and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation. In 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission. In 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.",

      "She received her own royal household at birth. Just one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark. In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm. After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia. In 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige.",

However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity.",
      "In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772. The politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. The relationship between the spouses improved somewhat in the years from 1775 to 1783, but subsequently deteriorated again. After her husband was assassinated in 1792, Sophia Magdalena withdrew from public life, and led a quiet life as dowager queen until her death in 1813. Early life\nPrincess Sophie Magdalene was born on 3 July 1746 at her parents' residence Charlottenborg Palace, located at the large square, Kongens Nytorv, in central Copenhagen. She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth. Just one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark. In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden.",
      "This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over \u00d6resund to H\u00e4lsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at St\u00e4ket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at S\u00e4by Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace."

      "\"Rohmer saw the full-face closeup as a device that does not reflect how we see each other and avoided its use. He avoids extradiegetic music (not coming from onscreen sound sources), seeing it as a violation of the fourth wall. He has on occasion departed from the rule by inserting soundtrack music in places in The Green Ray (1986) (released as Summer in the United States). Rohmer also tends to spend considerable time in his films showing his characters going from place to place, walking, driving, bicycling or commuting on a train, engaging the viewer in the idea that part of the day of each individual involves quotidian travel. This was most evident in Le Beau Mariage (1982), which had the female protagonist constantly traveling, particularly between Paris and Le Mans. Rohmer typically populates his films with people in their twenties and the settings are often on pleasant beaches and popular resorts, notably in La Collectionneuse (1967), Pauline at the Beach (1983), The Green Ray (1986) and A Summer's Tale (1996). These films are immersed in an environment of bright sunlight, blue skies, green grass, sandy beaches, and clear waters. He explained that \"people sometimes ask me why most of the main characters in my films are young. I don't feel at ease with older people ... I can't get people older than forty to talk convincingly. \"Rohmer preferred to use non-professional actors in his films. He usually held a large number of rehearsals before shooting and would shoot his films very quickly. He spent little time editing his films. He usually shot his films chronologically, and often shot scenes during the time of day in which they took place. He explained that \"my films are based on meteorology. If I didn't call the weather service everyday, I couldn't make my films because they're shot according to the weather outside. My films are slaves to weather. \"The director's characters engage in long conversations\u2014mostly talking about man\u2013woman relationships but also on mundane issues like trying to find a vacation spot.",
      "There are also occasional digressions by the characters on literature and philosophy as most of Rohmer's characters are middle class and university educated. A Summer's Tale (1996) has most of the elements of a typical Rohmer film: no soundtrack music, no close-ups, a seaside resort, long conversations between beautiful young people (who are middle class and educated) and discussions involving the characters' interests from songwriting to ethnology. Rohmer said he wanted to look at \"thoughts rather than actions\", dealing \"less with what people do than what is going on in their minds while they are doing it.\" Beginning in the late 1970s during the production of Perceval le Gallois Rohmer began to reduce the number of crew members on his films. He first dispensed with the script supervisor, then (controversially) cut out the assistant director, then all other assistants and technical managers until, by the time he shot The Green Ray in 1986, his crew consisted only of a camera operator and a sound engineer. Rohmer stated that \"I even wonder if I could work in the usual conditions of filmmaking. \"His style was famously criticised by Gene Hackman's character in the 1975 film Night Moves who describes viewing Rohmer's films as \"kind of like watching paint dry\". Rohmer was a highly literary man. His films frequently refer to ideas and themes in plays and novels, such as references to Jules Verne (in The Green Ray), William Shakespeare (in A Winter's Tale) and Pascal's wager (in Ma nuit chez Maud). Personal life and death\nRohmer's brother was the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00e9rer. In 1957, Rohmer married Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Barbet. The couple had two sons. The elder, Ren\u00e9 Monzat (b. 1958), is an author and investigative journalist at, most recently, Le Monde and Mediapart. His work focuses on the French far-right. Rohmer was a devout Catholic and \"ecological zealot\". For years he had no telephone and refused to get into cars, which he called \"immoral pollutors\". For many years he was known to jog two miles to his office every morning.",
      "In the article, Rohmer writes that in an age of cultural self-consciousness, film is \"the last refuge of poetry\" and the only contemporary art form from which metaphor can still spring naturally and spontaneously. In 1957 Rohmer and Claude Chabrol wrote Hitchcock (Paris: \u00c9ditions Universitaires, 1957), the earliest book-length study of Alfred Hitchcock. It focuses on Hitchcock's Catholic background and has been called \"one of the most influential film books since the Second World War, casting new light on a filmmaker hitherto considered a mere entertainer\". Hitchcock helped establish the auteur theory as a critical method and contributed to the reevaluation of the American cinema that was central to that method. By 1963 Rohmer was becoming more at odds with some of the more radical left-wing critics at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He continued to admire US films while many of the other left-wing critics had rejected them and were championing cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and Marxist film criticism. Rohmer resigned that year and was succeeded by Rivette. Film career\n1950\u20131962: Shorts and early film career In 1950 Rohmer made his first 16mm short film, Journal d'un sc\u00e9l\u00e9rat. The film starred writer Paul G\u00e9gauff and was made with a borrowed camera. By 1951 Rohmer had a bigger budget provided by friends and shot the short film Pr\u00e9sentation ou Charlotte et son steak. The 12-minute film was co-written by and starred Jean-Luc Godard. The film was not completed until 1961. In 1952 Rohmer began collaborating with Pierre Guilbaud on a one-hour short feature, Les Petites Filles mod\u00e8les, but the film was never finished. In 1954 Rohmer made and acted in B\u00e9r\u00e9nice, a 15-minute short based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1956 Rohmer directed, wrote, edited and starred in La Sonate \u00e0 Kreutzer, a 50-minute film produced by Godard. In 1958 Rohmer made V\u00e9ronique et son cancre, a 20-minute short produced by Chabrol. Chabrol's company AJYM produced Rohmer's feature directorial debut, The Sign of Leo (Le Signe du lion) in 1959. In the film an American composer spends the month of August waiting for his inheritance while all his friends are on vacation and gradually becomes impoverished.",
      "The first \"Comedy and proverb\" was The Aviator's Wife, which was based on an idea that Rohmer had had since the mid-1940s. This was followed in 1981 with Le Beau Mariage (A Perfect Marriage), the second \"Comedy and Proverb\". Rohmer stated that \"what interests me is to show how someone's imagination works. The fact that obsession can replace reality.\" In his review of the film, film critic Claude Baign\u00e8res said that \"Eric Rohmer is a virtuoso of the pen sketch...[He had not been] at ease with the paint tubes that Persival required, [but in this film he created] a tiny figurine whose every feature, every curl, every tone is aimed at revealing to us a state of soul and of heart.\" Raphael Bassan said that \"the filmmaker fails to achieve in these dialogues the flexibility, the textual freedom of The Aviator's Wife. A Perfect Marriage is only a variation on the spiritual states of the petty bourgeoise who go on and on forever about the legitimacy of certain institutions or beliefs confronted by problems of the emotions. Quite simply, this is a minor variation on this central Rohmerian theme.\"The third \"Comedy and proverb\" was Pauline at the Beach in 1983. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. It was based on an idea that Rohmer had in the 1950s, originally intended for Brigitte Bardot. Rohmer often made films that he had been working on for many years and stated \"I can't say 'I make one film, then after that film I look for a subject and write on that subject...then I shoot.' Not at all...these are films that are drawn from one evolving mass, films that have been in my head for a long time and that I think about simultaneously. \"The fourth \"Comedy and Proverb\" was Full Moon in Paris in 1984. The film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: \"The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind.\" The film's cinematographer Renato Berta called it \"one of the most luxurious films ever made\" because of the high amount of preparation put into it.",
      "He meets a second woman who works in a bakery and begins to flirt with her, but abandons her when he finally finds the first woman. Schroder starred as the young man and Bertrand Tavernier was the narrator. The second Moral Tale was Suzanne's Career (1963). This 60-minute film portrays a young student who is rejected by one woman and begins a romantic relationship with a second. The first and second Moral Tales were never theatrically released and Rohmer was disappointed by their poor technical quality. They were not well known until after the release of the other four. In 1963 Les Films du Losange produced the New Wave omnibus film Six in Paris, of which Rohmer's short \"Place de l'Etoile\" was the centerpiece.: 290\u200a After being driven out of his editor position at Cahiers, Rohmer began making short documentaries for French television. Between 1964 and 1966 Rohmer made 14 shorts for television through the Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise (ORTF) and T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Scolaire. These included episodes of Filmmakers of Our Time on Louis Lumiere and Carl Theodor Dreyer, educational films on Blaise Pascal and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, and documentaries on the Percival legend, the industrial revolution and female students in Paris. Rohmer later said that television taught him how to make \"readable images\". He later said, \"When you show a film on TV, the framing goes to pieces, straight lines are warped...the way people stand and walk and move, the whole physical dimension...all this is lost. Personally I don't feel that TV is an intimate medium.\" In 1964 Rohmer made the 13-minute short film Nadja \u00e0 Paris with cinematographer Nestor Almendros. Rohmer and Schroder then sold the rights of two of their short films to French television in order to raise $60,000 to produce the feature film La Collectionneuse in 1967, the third Moral Tale. The film's budget went only to film stock and renting a house in St. Tropez as a set. Rohmer described it as a film about l'amour par d\u00e9soeuvrement (\"love from idleness\")."

Grand Duke Vladimir was in the Imperial capital when his father was assassinated and succeeded by Alexander III in 1881. It fell upon Vladimir, who regained his composure more quickly than his brother, to announce their father's death to the public. Vladimir inherited his father's personal library, which the Grand Duke added to his large book-collection that was arranged in three libraries at the Vladimir Palace.

      "Eventually, Nicholas II relented and forgave his cousins for marrying without his consent, but he did not allow them to return to Russia. The full pardon came only after several deaths in the family, including Vladimir's own, had placed Kirill third in the line of succession to the Imperial Throne. Grand Duke Vladimir died suddenly on 4(O.S.)/17(N.S.) February 1909 after suffering a major cerebral hemorrhage. Vladimir's widow and their four children survived the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Her father was the third son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece, while her mother was the only daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Her father was a grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark, while her mother was a granddaughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Princess Elizabeth had two sisters, an older sister Princess Olga and a younger sister Princess Marina. Princess Olga married Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in 1923. After the assassination of his cousin, King Alexander I, Paul served as Prince Regent of Yugoslavia from 1934 to 1941. Princess Marina married Prince George, Duke of Kent, in 1934.

      "At the present time, not one of the Emperors or Grand Dukes of Russia has left living descendants with unchallengeable rights to the Throne of Russia,\" and his younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanov, said of Maria's assumption of titles, including \"de jure Empress of all the Russias\", \"It seems that there are no limits to this charade\". The supporters of Maria Vladimirovna point to the fact that neither Nicholas nor his brother Dimitri had any dynastic claims due to the morganatic marriage of their parents. By the Pauline Laws, she is the rightful heir to the throne. The Pauline Laws emphasize male succession before female succession. As an example, if Tsarevich Alexei Romanov had not been murdered in 1918, and died without issue (i.e., without children), his sisters, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia wouldn't become Empresses before male Romanov relatives. Alexander III had four sons: Nicholas II of Russia whose only male son died before he could produce heirs, Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia, who died shortly before he was 11 months old, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia, who died with no issue, and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia whose only son, George Mikhailovich, Count Brasov died at age 20, childless. From there, the line of succession looks to Alexander III's father, Alexander II. His sons, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia, and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia both died without issue. Excluding the future Alexander III, the third boy Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia \u2013 born after the childless Tsarevich and Alexander III, whose descendants couldn\u2019t claim leadership for many reasons \u2013 had four sons. The eldest died in infancy and the second eldest, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, had one son, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia. His only child is Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia, making her the legal heir to the Russian throne. Following the discovery of the remains of Emperor Nicholas II and most of his immediate family in 1991, Maria Vladimirovna wrote to President Boris Yeltsin regarding the burial of the remains, saying of her Romanov cousins, whom she does not recognise as members of the Imperial House (including the grandchildren of Nicholas II's sister Grand Duchess Xenia), that they \"do not have the slightest right to speak their mind and wishes on this question."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "He began selling American films to Yorkshire exhibitors, occasionally working with Victor Saville. Astra Films\nIn 1919, Wilcox used his war gratuity to found his own distribution company, Astra Films, in association with his brother and a colleague, Jack Smart. Wilcox contributed \u00a3117, and the others made up the rest. It was based in Yorkshire. \"Owing to the war, there were practically no British productions\", said Wilcox. \"They were almost all American films.\" The company was immediately successful so they expanded into London. Graham-Wilcox Productions\nAstra had a lot of success with a British film, A Peep Behind the Scenes (1919) so Wilcox decided to produce a British film himself. He raised \u00a31,400 to make The Wonderful Story (1922). It was directed by a Newcastle exhibitor who shared Wilcox's enthusiasm for D. W. Griffith, Jack Graham Cutts; he and Wilcox established Graham-Wilcox Productions. Wilcox sold the film for \u00a34,000 and the premiere got excellent reviews. This enabled Wilcox to raise funds for a slate of films, before The Wonderful Story was released and flopped at the box office. However the next Graham-Wilcox production, Flames of Passion (1922), starring imported Hollywood star Mae Marsh was a big hit, among the first British films sold to the USA. The success of the film inspired Wilcox to steer away from realistic drama and focus on escapist entertainment. Director\nWilcox optioned the screen rights for Chu-Chin-Chow (1923), with imported American star Betty Blythe. The film was shot in Germany at UFA's studios in association with Eric Pommer with a huge budget but was only a moderate success. He followed it with Southern Love (1924), shot in Vienna, again with Blythe. Wilcox launched the film with a mock bull fight in Albert Hall and says the film returned a profit in England alone. Pommer asked Wilcox to collaborate again and they made Decameron Nights (1924). Back in Britain he made Paddy the Next Best Thing (1923). After what he described as a \"series of unimpressive films\" he made The Only Way (1926), based on a stage play which was based on A Tale of Two Cities.",
      "He followed it with Nell Gwyn (1926), starring Dorothy Gish in the title role. This was a big success around the world. British National Films\nThe world rights to Nell Gwyn were purchased by British National Films, a company established by J.D. Williams, who signed Wilcox and Gish to make three more films, all financed by Paramount:  Madame Pompadour (1926), the first film shot at the newly built Elstree Studios; London (1926); and Tip Toes (1927). It was later revealed in a court case that Wilcox's fee was \u00a33,000 a film plus 25% of the profits, but there were no profits for the three films. British and Dominions Film Corporation\nWilcox ended up leaving British National and founded the British and Dominions Film Corporation with Nelson Keys with capital of half a million pounds. HIs first film for them, via Herbert Wilcox Productions, was Mumsie (1927), starring Pauline Frederick and, in his debut, Herbert Marshall. Wilcox wanted to make another film with Frederick and suggested No\u00ebl Coward's The Vortex but Frederick disliked the role. Wilcox instead decided to do a version of the Edith Cavell story, Dawn (1928). Frederick dropped out of the film, and was replaced by Sybil Thorndike. Filming proved difficult but the resulting movie was a big hit. In 1928 British and Dominion Films insured Wilcox for \u00a3100,000.There was some talk he would make a film of the Burke and Wills story. Instead he made what he described as \"a series of unimportant but profitable films\": The Bondman (1929), The Woman in White (1929),\n\nSound Films\nGenerally, Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is regarded as the first film with sound, but Wilcox's Black Waters was trade-shown several weeks earlier in May, 1929.He produced more than a hundred films, of which he directed about half. \"His film production team were never laid off, even during the worst depressions of the British film industry. They were on full salary 52 weeks of the year. \"Wilcox built and equipped sound studios next to the British International Pictures studios, which they bought from John Maxwell.",
      "It was followed by Fame (1936), which he produced, starring Sydney Howard and new Wilcox discovers Miki Hood and Geraldine Hislop. He and Neagle did a story about trapeze artists, Three Maxims (1936).He made Where's George? (1936) with Sydney Howard. Wilcox was back with Buchanan with This'll Make You Whistle (1936). He wanted to make an epic version of The Blue Lagoon with Hollywood stars to be shot mostly on location in Hawaii and a biopic of Lady Hamilton with Neagle but neither was made. Instead he made Millions (1937). Wilcox's film studio at Elstree burnt down and Wilcox moved to new studios at Pinewood. There he made London Melody (1937) with Neagle. RKO\nWilcox wanted to star Neagle in a biopic of Queen Victoria. Woolf refused to finance it, believing it to be a bad investment, so Wilcox raised the bulk of the finance himself. Wilcox invested his entire savings and Neagle put in \u00a310,000. They secured a distribution agreement with RKO. Victoria the Great (1937) was a massive success and led to Wilcox signing a ten-year deal with RKO to help finance and distribute the films. He and Neagle promptly made a sequel, Sixty Glorious Years (1938). Wilcox produced but did not direct A Royal Divorce (1938) starring Ruth Chatterton. Wilcox announced he would make a biopic of Lord Kitchener but the film was never made. Hollywood\nHe and Neagle went to the US to work for RKO. They looked into making a biopic of Marie Lloyd but could not find a suitable co-star for Neagle so instead made another biopic, Nurse Edith Cavell (1939). They were going to follow it with a biopic of Flora MacDonald filmed in Scotland but the declaration of war made that impossible. Instead they made three musicals: Irene (1940), with Ray Milland; No, No, Nanette (1940), with Victor Mature; and Sunny (1941) with Ray Bolger. They were among the many names who worked on Forever and a Day (1943). In July 1941, Wilcox and Neagle returned to England to make They Flew Alone (1942) a biopic of Amy Johnson and the war thriller Yellow Canary (1943).",
      "The London Films\nWilcox and Neagle had a big hit with I Live in Grosvenor Square (1945), co starring Rex Harrison and Dean Jagger. They followed it with Piccadilly Incident (1946), starring Neagle and Michael Wilding, which was even more popular, the second biggest British hit of 1946. Wilcox signed Wilding to a long-term contract. The Courtneys of Curzon Street (1947) was the most popular film at the British box office in 1947. Another hit was Spring in Park Lane (1948). Wilding was not in their next film, Elizabeth of Ladymead (1948) but returned for Maytime in Mayfair (1949), a sequel to Spring in Park Lane, and another massive success. Wilcox and Neagle returned to war stories with Odette (1950) a biopic of Odette Samson starring Neagle and Trevor Howard, and Wilcox's most profitable movie to date. He planned to make a biopic about Van Gogh starring Trevor Howard, but it was never made. Wilcox made a film without Neagle, Into the Blue (1950), with Wilding and Odile Versois; it was not particularly popular. Neagle and Wilding were reunited for The Lady with a Lamp (1951), a biopic of Florence Nightingale and Derby Day (1952), an ensemble film. Both did well at the box office but not as well as the late 40s films. Margaret Lockwood and Republic Pictures\nIn the early 1950s Neagle had a long running stage hit, The Glorious Years. In November 1951 Wilcox signed a multi picture deal with Margaret Lockwood to make six films in three years. The following year he signed a six-picture deal with Republic Films. The first movie Lockwood-Wilcox film, Trent's Last Case (1952) was a solid success, helped by a cast including Wilding and Orson Welles. However Laughing Anne (1953), co-starring Forrest Tucker and Wendell Corey, and Trouble in the Glen (1954), with Welles, did poorly and he made no further films with Lockwood or Republic. Wilcox was further hurt when a film he produced, The Beggar's Opera (1953), was a box office disaster. Errol Flynn and Ivor Novello\nWilcox formed a new production company, Everest, and made two musicals with Neagle and Errol Flynn: Lilacs in the Spring (1954), based on The Glorious Years, and King's Rhapsody (1955), based on a musical by Ivor Novello.",
      "Both flopped and plans to make a third Novello film, Perchance to Dream did not happen. Last films\nWilcox had a hit with My Teenage Daughter (1956), a story of Neagle dealing with a juvenile delinquent daughter played by Sylvia Syms. Less successful was These Dangerous Years (1957), produced by Neagle and directed by Wilcox, starring George Baker and Frankie Vaughan, and no Neagle. He produced but did not direct a war film,  Yangtse Incident (1957), which performed reasonably well at the British box office but ultimately lost money. Wilcox found himself personally liable for some of the film's costs. He tried a drama with Neagle, The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1958), and three films with Vaughan: Wonderful Things! (1958), The Heart of a Man (1959), and The Lady Is a Square (1959). Bankruptcy\nWilcox was plagued with financial troubles in the 1950s and 1960s. He missed an early opportunity to invest in television; Anna Neagle's chain of dancing schools failed; he and Neagle invested heavily in British Lion shares and the company went into receivership; he borrowed \u00a3341,000 from the Edgware Trust; he and Neagle had guaranteed a \u00a375,000 loan to make the two Errol Flynn films; and he paid \u00a3100,000 to Terence Rattigan for the film rights to his play Ross only for him to be unable to get it made. His film company failed in the 1960s. He spent two years trying to make a film about King Edward VII but the Queen refused permission. He was declared bankrupt in 1964, owing \u00a316,000 to the Edgware Trust and \u00a3134,313 over all. However, the musical play Charlie Girl, starring his wife Anna Neagle, ran for five years and resolved this financial situation. Wilcox made some money from writing articles and was discharged as a bankrupt in 1966 after paying about 4 1/2 d in the pound to creditors. According to one profile \"The conventional view of Wilcox is that, despite his eventual bankruptcy, his considerable entrepreneurial skills enabled him to sustain a continued presence over a long period in a notoriously unstable industry; discussion of his directorial qualities usually acknowledges his professionalism but falls short of crediting him with any authorial status."

      "This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated. After King Adolf Frederick of Sweden died in 1771, Gustav III became King of Sweden. The following year, on 29 May, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen. Early reign as Queen The coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the coup of Gustav III, which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time she was deemed as suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, primarily by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish. Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup; there were also plans to conquer Norway from Denmark. Sophia Magdalena was informed about politics nonetheless: she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament because Count Fredrik Ribbing, for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat. The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper Dagligt Allehanda, a fable was presented about R\u00e4vinnan och Turturduvan (\"The She Fox and the Turtle Dove\"). The fable was about the innocent turtle dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked she fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the second she fox (Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne) and the other foxes (the nobility). The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party. Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award.",
      "The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home. This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated.

Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse. As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation \u2013 more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation.",
      "Already at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, as part of an attempt to improve the traditionally tense relationship between the two Scandinavian realms. She was subsequently brought up to be the Queen of Sweden, and they married in 1766. In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772. The politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion.

      "In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772. The politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. The relationship between the spouses improved somewhat in the years from 1775 to 1783, but subsequently deteriorated again. After her husband was assassinated in 1792, Sophia Magdalena withdrew from public life, and led a quiet life as dowager queen until her death in 1813.

She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark. In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden."

      "At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image. A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schr\u00f6derheim and Eva Helena L\u00f6wen. The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".:\u200a103\u20134\u200aThe Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked. Sophia Magdalena was equally shocked by the accusations. She swore she would never speak to the Queen Dowager again, and indeed she never did. The King arranged for his mother to make a public apology for her accusation in the presence of the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd. Sven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom.",

To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned. In 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies.",
      "Munck and Ramstr\u00f6m were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber. Munck himself writes in his written account, which is preserved at the National Archives of Sweden, that to succeed, he was obliged to touch them both physically. When it became known that Munck participated in the reconciliation between the royal couple, there were rumours that he was the father of Sophia Magdalena's firstborn. These became the subject of accusations from the political opposition, as late as in 1786 and 1789,:\u200a132\u200a where it was claimed that the whole nation was aware of the rumour that the King had asked Munck to make the Queen pregnant.:\u200a118\u200a Pamphlets to that end were posted on street corners all over Stockholm.: 143 This was also caricatured by Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd in private letters discovered later \u2013 his drawing was published in 1987 \u2014, where he passed on a number of rumors and jokes about Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena and Munck without inferring that he believed they were true. There was also a rumour that the King and Queen had divorced in secret and that the Queen had married Munck. There is no proof that Munck was the father of the crown prince. Erik L\u00f6nnroth has suggested that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image. A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schr\u00f6derheim and Eva Helena L\u00f6wen. The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".:\u200a103\u20134\u200aThe Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked.",

In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,:\u200a191\u200a as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual. In 1787, Sophia Magdalena deposited a sum of 50.000 riksdaler in an account for Munck, which was generally rumoured to be a \"farewell gift\".: 156\u20137\u200a  At this point, Munck had started an affair with the ballerina Giovanna Bassi, to whom Sophia Magdalena showed great dislike.: 157\u200a  The King was terrified when he heard that the Queen had made that deposit, and he tried to prevent the transaction from becoming public knowledge, which, however, did not succeed.: 157\u200a Munck was, however, continued to be used as a go-between and a messenger between the King and the Queen, especially during conflicts. A child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince. Queen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.:\u200a443\u200a As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles."

      "During his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds. As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later. Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001.

      "At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\". On 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace. Sophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life. Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend. Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous. Sophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the Caps, who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the Hats. The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home. This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated.",
      "She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at St\u00e4ket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at S\u00e4by Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\". On 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace. Sophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life. Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend. Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous. Sophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the Caps, who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the Hats. The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home.",
      "However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over \u00d6resund to H\u00e4lsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way.",

      "He fought with the baron des Adrets in Dauphin\u00e9, and in December was in the process of negotiating a favourable truce with the infamous commander which would have seen him secure the defection of the rebel army. However, Adrets' subordinates learned of the negotiations and had him arrested. In the major field battle of the war at Dreux, the governor of the Lyonnais, Beaujolais and Forez, Marshal Saint-Andr\u00e9 was murdered on the field after having surrendered. This left a vacancy for his governate, which was to be filled by Nemours. In the wake of the Edict of Amboise which brought the first civil war to a close with the provision of limited toleration to Protestants the crown desired to reconcile the factions to ensure internal peace. To this end they courted Cond\u00e9, hoping to foster his loyalty. Catherine de Medici informed Anne d'Este that she had successfully reconciled Cond\u00e9 with Nemours and Cardinal Guise, brother of the late duke. Feud\nDuring the final siege of the first war of religion, the duke of Guise had been assassinated. The family blamed Gaspard II de Coligny for ordering the hit and were determined to pursue 'justice' against the Admiral. Coligny for his part came under the protection of his uncle Montmorency, who re-opened his rivalry with the Guise in defence of his nephew. In an attempt to gain the upper hand, the Guise arranged for a petition to court, from many leading nobles, arguing for the right to open a case against Coligny. Nemours was among the signatories, however the court proved uninterested, and formally suspended any investigation into the murder in early 1564. Governor\nAs governor of the Lyonnais, Nemours was keen to patronise 'men of letters' and other centres of learning within his governate. As the crown increasingly loomed on the cusp of bankruptcy, the distribution of funds to its regional governors became more erratic and rare. By 1565 Nemours had accumulated 140,000 livres of debts for unpaid pensions and salaries during his tenure as governor.",
      "By this term he referred to the Guise, who were from Lorraine, and the duke of Nevers and Nemours, both of whom were of Italian descent. While Alen\u00e7on would succeed in securing favourable terms for himself in the Peace of Monsieur, Nemours and Nevers would remain active in court life. Ligue\nIn response to the generous Peace of Monsieur which brought the fifth war of religion to a close, militant Catholics reacted with fury. Many across France began forming religious leagues, the most popular model of which was that created by Jacques d'Humi\u00e8res in Peronne which began to spread across France. Henri suspected the involvement of Henri, Duke of Guise, Charles, Duke of Mayenne and Nemours as ringleaders of this ligue and made them all swear oaths to abide by the terms of the peace of Monsieur. Frustrated at his continued inability to contain the movement, he declared himself to be at its head, and was compelled by the Estates General of 1576 to void the peace and make war on the Protestants again. Having primarily devoted his final years to letters and art, he died at Annecy in 1585. Ancestry\nPassage 5:\nJean d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours\nJean d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours (1467\u20131500) was the son of Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours and Louise of Anjou. His father's possessions were confiscated on his execution in 1477, but Jean was restored to Nemours and the family's other lands in 1484. He led a dissipated life, and his siblings sued him to prevent him from alienating the family lands to pay his debts. In 1489, he traded the viscounties of Carlat and Murat to Peter II, Duke of Bourbon for the county of l'Isle-Jourdain. He married Yolande de La Haye (d. 1517) in 1492, but had no children. He was succeeded by his brother Louis, Count of Guise. Passage 6:\nMaria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria\nMaria of Brabant (1226\u20131256) was a daughter of Henry II, Duke of Brabant, and Maria of Swabia. She married Louis II, Duke of Bavaria, being the first of three wives. Background\nMaria was the daughter of Duke Henry II of Brabant and Lorraine from his first marriage to Maria of Swabia, daughter of King Philip of Swabia.",
      "Nevertheless the crown was conscious that Louis of Nassau was seeking to enter France with an army from the Spanish Netherlands; to this end Charles instructed Nemours to assemble an army for the defence of Paris, however Nassau was bested at the border. In early 1569, it became clear that the duke of Zweibr\u00fccken was intending to cross into France in support of the Protestant nobility that was gathered in the west. To this end the court, little desiring to see a conjunction between the two forces, assembled a second army. Aumale was tasked with leading the blocking force in Champagne, with forces from the Rh\u00f4ne valley under Nemours to support him in this effort. The two commanders did not get along, and their constant conflict enabled Zweibr\u00fccken to slip past them through the Franche-Comt\u00e9 and establish contact with the Protestants under Gaspard II de Coligny. The mutinous remains of their combined army linked with the main royal force under the king's brother Anjou at Limoges. Withdrawal\nBy 1571, Nemours wished to resign his governorship of the Lyonnais. He chose to do so in favour of his lieutenant-general in the region, and former page Fran\u00e7ois de Mandelot. This arrangement had been very unusual in the early 16th century, with the choice of governors defaulting to the crown on the resignation or death of a sitting governor; however by the 1560s it was becoming increasingly common. Mandelot would govern the Lyonnais until his death in 1588. Reign of Henri III\nMalcontents\nBy 1575 Protestants were no longer the only ones in rebellion, as the Malcontent movement swept up many politiques who wished for religious compromise to secure stability in the kingdom. Nevers warned the king's younger brother Alen\u00e7on, not to take the opportunity presented, saying that those who rebelled against the authority of the king did not triumph. Yet Alen\u00e7on saw this movement as conducive to his own power, and aligned himself with the Malcontents, releasing a manifesto in which he denounced the influence of 'foreigners' and calling for their exclusion from the estates general.",
      "It was hoped by governors that these debts would be satisfied by the court when it had greater funds. Second war of religion\nFrustrated at their declining influence in court, and the increasingly restrictive direction royal policy was moving in regarding Protestantism, the leading Protestants again plotted a coup. Their aim was to seize the king while he was staying at Meaux, and to kill Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. Their attempt was a failure and the king was able to retreat with the court to Paris after some debate. While H\u00f4pital, the chancellor, had argued in favour of relying on the fortifications at Meaux, Nemours and Guise advocated a flight to Paris and convinced the court successfully. As they fled, they were pursued by the Protestant forces, who adapted their plan to a siege of Paris. To this end they began trying to invest the city, while Anne de Montmorency assembled an army inside for a breakout. While Montmorency was busy building an army, Nemours was among those commanders trying to relieve pressure on the city. On 7 November he successfully captured a river crossing that was vital to a successful siege of Paris. Several days later Montmorency was ready and broke out of the city, besting the Protestant army at Saint-Denis on 10 November. During the battle of Saint-Denis, Montmorency would be killed, leaving the office of Constable of France and role as chief of the crown's military vacant. The crown had little desire to see another powerful noble family control this critical post; as such, to replace him, the king's brother Anjou was selected to lead the crown's war effort. While closer to the family, Anjou was still a child, and as such to provide him military guidance, and to actually lead the army in the field, a selection of loyal nobles were chosen. Artus de Coss\u00e9-Brissac the recently promoted Marshal, the king's cousin Louis, Duke of Montpensier and Nemours were chosen for this important role, with Coss\u00e9 in overall charge. Third war of religion\nAt the outset of the third war of religion, the Protestants had consolidated their movement in the south west as opposed to fighting in the north as they had previously.",
      "In 1559 Henri II died during a joust, and was succeeded by his young son Fran\u00e7ois II. The new administration, led by the Guise due to Fran\u00e7ois' young age was plagued with religious and financial difficulties, that emboldened a conspiracy to form against it. Nemours played a key role in crushing the Conspiracy of Amboise, capturing several of the leaders, and infamously promising the baron de Castelnau that if he surrendered no harm would come to him, the baron shortly thereafter being executed despite the pleas of many nobles. The following year he involved himself in a conspiracy to spirit away the 10-year-old Anjou from court, so that he could be 'raised in Catholic environs'. The plot was uncovered, and facing arrest, Nemours fled from court. The case against him collapsed, however, as the only evidence was the word of the young prince. Around this time a case was also looming against him for his relationship indiscretions. Fran\u00e7oise de Rohan being distraught that he had given her a child without fulfilling his promise to marry her, the case would gestate for the next four years until the archbishop of Lyon ruled in his favour in 1565, allowing him to marry the widowed Anne d'Este the following year. Nemours fought during the first war of religion, fighting the baron des Adrets around Lyon and the Dauphin\u00e9. With the death of the Marshal Saint-Andr\u00e9 on the field of Dreux in December, he became the governor of the Lyonnais, an office he would hold for the next nine years before resigning it in favour of his lieutenant-general Fran\u00e7ois de Mandelot. Nemours remained close with the Guise, supporting them in their feud with the Montmorency over the assassination of the duke of Guise without notable results. Nemours was with the court during the Surprise of Meaux and successfully counselled the court to make a flight to Paris. While besieged in Paris the following month, he aided in breaking the ring the Protestants had set up around the city before Anne de Montmorency's victory at the battle of Saint Denis."

      "On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. Sophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von H\u00f6pken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day. In the famous diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as \"Forced to meet people\". Sophia Magdalena preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderstr\u00f6m, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational  duties.",
      "She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse.

      "The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party. Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse.

      "Sophia Magdalena preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderstr\u00f6m, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational  duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history. She educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian, and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation. In 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission. In 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, he was able to telegraph about 100 words a minute, or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute, and even of 400 words a minute between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin's-le-Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by Alexander Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system is often referred to as the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market ticker tape. Optics\nStereopsis was first described by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses. The 'pseudoscope' (Wheatstone coined the term from the Greek \u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03af\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) was introduced in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust appears to be a mask, and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing inside the room.",
      "Mrs Drummond told me he is wonderful for the rapidity with which he thinks and his power of invention; he invents so many things that he cannot put half his ideas into execution, but leaves them to be picked up and used by others, who get the credit of them. \"\n\nPublic attention and success\nThe public took to the new invention after the capture of the murderer John Tawell, who in 1845, had become the first person to be arrested as the result of telecommunications technology. In the same year, Wheatstone introduced two improved forms of the apparatus, namely, the 'single' and the 'double' needle instruments, in which the signals were made by the successive deflections of the needles. Of these, the single-needle instrument, requiring only one wire, is still in use. The development of the telegraph may be gathered from two facts. In 1855, the death of the Emperor Nicholas at St. Petersburg, about one o'clock in the afternoon, was announced in the House of Lords a few hours later. The result of The Oaks of 1890 was received in New York fifteen seconds after the horses passed the winning-post. Differences with Cooke\nIn 1841 a difference arose between Cooke and Wheatstone as to the share of each in the honour of inventing the telegraph. The question was submitted to the arbitration of the famous engineer, Marc Isambard Brunel, on behalf of Cooke, and Professor Daniell, of King's College, the inventor of the Daniell cell, on the part of Wheatstone. They awarded to Cooke the credit of having introduced the telegraph as a useful undertaking which promised to be of national importance, and to Wheatstone that of having by his researches prepared the public to receive it. They concluded with the words: 'It is to the united labours of two gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance that we must attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has made during five years since they have been associated.' The decision, however vague, pronounces the needle telegraph a joint production.",
      "If it had mainly been invented by Wheatstone, it was chiefly introduced by Cooke. Their respective shares in the undertaking might be compared to that of an author and his publisher, but for the fact that Cooke himself had a share in the actual work of invention. Further work on telegraphs\nFrom 1836\u20137 Wheatstone had thought a good deal about submarine telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, with the assistance of J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of insulated wire in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of gutta-percha for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel. In 1840 Wheatstone had patented an alphabetical telegraph, or, 'Wheatstone A B C instrument,' which moved with a step-by-step motion, and showed the letters of the message upon a dial. The same principle was used in his type-printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper. The introduction of the telegraph had so far advanced that, on 2 September 1845, the Electric Telegraph Company was registered, and Wheatstone, by his deed of partnership with Cooke, received a sum of \u00a333,000 for the use of their joint inventions. In 1859 Wheatstone was appointed by the Board of Trade to report on the subject of the Atlantic cables, and in 1864 he was one of the experts who advised the Atlantic Telegraph Company on the construction of the successful lines of 1865 and 1866. In 1870 the electric telegraph lines of the United Kingdom, worked by different companies, were transferred to the Post Office, and placed under Government control. Wheatstone further invented the automatic transmitter, in which the signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper (punched tape), which is then passed through the sending-key, and controls the signal currents.",
      "In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from William \nCooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future. Cooperation with Cooke\nCooke was an officer in the Madras Army, who, being home on leave, was attending some lectures on anatomy at the University of Heidelberg, where, on 6 March 1836, he witnessed a demonstration with the telegraph of professor Georg Munke, and was so impressed with its importance, that he forsook his medical studies and devoted all his efforts to the work of introducing the telegraph. He returned to London soon after, and was able to exhibit a telegraph with three needles in January 1837. Feeling his want of scientific knowledge, he consulted Michael Faraday and Peter Roget (then secretary of the Royal Society): Roget sent him to Wheatstone. At a second interview, Cooke told Wheatstone of his intention to bring out a working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object was to make a fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a needle into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork."

    "documentation": [
      "After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I.\n\nEarly work in Hollywood\nThe success of the various productions of Journey's End brought Whale to the attention of movie producers. Coming at a time when motion pictures were making the transition from silent to talking, producers were interested in hiring actors and directors with experience with dialogue. Whale traveled to Hollywood in 1929 and signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He was assigned as \"dialogue director\" for a film called The Love Doctor (1929). He completed work on the film in 15 days and his contract was allowed to expire. It was at around this time that he met David Lewis. Whale was hired by independent film producer and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, who planned to turn the previously silent Hughes production Hell's Angels (1930) into a talkie. Whale directed the dialogue sequences. When his work for Hughes was completed, he headed to Chicago to direct another production of Journey's End. Having purchased the film rights to Journey's End, British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale's experience directing the London and Broadway productions of the play made him the best choice to direct the film. The two partnered with a small American studio, Tiffany-Stahl, to shoot it in New York. Colin Clive reprised his role as Stanhope, and David Manners was cast as Raleigh. Filming got underway on 6 December 1929 and wrapped on 22 January 1930. Journey's End was released in Great Britain on 14 April and in the United States on 15 April.",
      "Passage 1:\nKeith Baxter (actor) Keith Baxter (born 29 April 1933) is a Welsh theatre, film and television actor. Early years and RADA\nBorn in Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1933, the son of a Merchant Navy sea captain, he was christened Keith Stanley Baxter-Wright and lived for a time in Romilly Road, Barry, Glamorgan. He was educated at Newport High School and Barry Grammar School. His early introduction to the stage was from his interest in making model theatres and stage scenery. He studied at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, during which period he shared a flat with a classmate, Alan Bates. He made his film debut in the 1957 remake of The Barretts of Wimpole Street and appeared uncredited as a detective in the British horror classic Peeping Tom (1960). Films\nIn 1960, Orson Welles selected Baxter to portray Prince Hal in his stage production Chimes at Midnight, which combined portions of the Shakespearean plays Henry IV, Part I, Henry IV, Part II, Henry V, Richard II, and The Merry Wives of Windsor and brought the comic figure of Falstaff to the forefront of a primarily tragic tale. Baxter repeated his performance in the 1965 film version. Additional film credits include Ash Wednesday (1973; with Elizabeth Taylor), Golden Rendezvous (1977), and Killing Time (1998). Broadway\nIn 1961, Baxter made his Broadway debut as King Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons. Other New York City stage credits include The Affair (1962), Avanti! (1968), Sleuth (1970), Romantic Comedy (1980) and The Woman in Black (2001). Other selected theatrical appearances\nMacbeth, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Birmingham, England, 1972\nVershinin, Three Sisters, Greenwich Theatre, London, 1973\nBenedick, Much Ado about Nothing, Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1973\nAntony, Antony and Cleopatra, Stratford Festival Theatre, Stratford, Ontario, 1976\nWitwoud, The Way of the World, Stratford Festival Theatre, 1976\nVershinin, Three Sisters, Stratford Festival Theatre, 1976\nKing, The Red Devil Battery Sign, Round House Theatre, then Phoenix Theatre, both London, 1977\nLord Illingworth, A Woman of No Importance, Chichester Festival Theatre, 1978\nAntony, Antony and Cleopatra, Young Vic Theatre, London, 1982\nElyot, Private Lives, Aldwych Theatre, London, 1990\nCassius, Julius Caesar, Hartford Stage Company, 1990-1991 The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Chichester and The Duchess Theatre, 2013\n\nDirecting\nThe Red Devil Battery Sign, Roundhouse and Phoenix Theatre, 1977\nTime and the Conways, 1988\u201389\nRope, Chichester Festival Theatre then Wyndham's Theatre, 1994\nDangerous Corner, Chichester Festival Theatre, 1994, and Whitehall Theatre, 1995",
      "On both sides of the Atlantic the film was a tremendous critical and commercial success. With the Laemmles at Universal\nUniversal Studios signed Whale to a five-year contract in 1931 and his first project was Waterloo Bridge. Based on the Broadway play by Robert E. Sherwood, the film stars Mae Clarke as Myra, a chorus girl in World War I London who becomes a prostitute. It too was a critical and popular success. At around this time, Whale and Lewis began living together. In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale his choice of any property the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him, and he wanted to make something other than a war picture. While Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to the little known Boris Karloff, who had wide-ranging experience in supporting roles. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release. Next from Whale were The Impatient Maiden and The Old Dark House (both 1932). The Impatient Maiden made little impression but The Old Dark House, starring Karloff and Charles Laughton, is credited with reinventing the \"dark house\" subgenre of horror films. Thought lost for some years, a print was found by filmmaker Curtis Harrington in the Universal vaults in 1968. It was restored by George Eastman House, and released on Blu-ray disk in 2017. Whale's next film was The Kiss Before the Mirror (1933), a critical success but a box-office failure. He returned to horror with The Invisible Man (1933).",
      "Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical Show Boat. Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire now Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realised he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime romantic partner, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterised by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera. At the height of his career as a director, Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision, and it was a critical failure. A run of box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool. Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very rare in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more widespread, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Another son, Richard, is attributed to Charles Willoughby and was likely had out of wedlock. Willoughby's second son, Ambrose, was one of the Queen's esquires of the body, and in early 1598 was involved in a brawl with Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Ambrose Willoughby had ordered Southampton to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at primero after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and 'Willoughby puld of some of his locke', for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying 'he had done better if he had sent him to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetch him out'. There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, Elizabeth Vernon, one of the Queen's Maids of Honour. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Ambrose Willoughby is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton: \"Gray Bridges hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges\". Ambrose Willoughby was knighted in 1603. Footnotes\nPassage 4:\nGeorge Willoughby, 7th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nGeorge Willoughby, 7th Baron Willoughby of Parham (1638\u20131674) was an English peer of the House of Lords. He was born at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, England on 18 March 1639, the son of William Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby of Parham and Anne Carey. On 9 October 1666, he married Elizabeth Clinton, daughter of Henry Clinton and Jane Markham. George and Elizabeth had three children: John Willoughby, 8th Baron Willoughby of Parham, his successor; Anne, who died in infancy; and Elizabeth, who married Hon. James Bertie, son of James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. On the death of his father in 1673, he succeeded as the 7th Baron Willoughby of Parham. He died in Knaith, Lincolnshire, England in 1674, aged 35.",
      "Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1547 and was the last male heir of the eldest line. Charles Willoughby married Marie daughter of Sir Beaumont Dixie, Bart of Bosworth. He died without a male heir on 9 December 1679. The first creation by letters patent stipulated the title must pass to heirs male of Sir William Willoughby 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham. Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham died without issue and left his estate to his niece Elizabeth, who had married James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Second Creation\nOn the death of the 10th Lord Willoughby, the title should have passed to the line of the next son of Charles 2nd Lord Willoughby, who was Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and then through his line to the eldest son, Edward Willoughby, and then Henry; however the family had emigrated to Virginia and it was believed this male line was extinct. The title passed instead through the line of Thomas the youngest son of Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham and his sons to Thomas Willoughby, who had married Eleanor Whittle, daughter of Hugh Whittle, a staunch Presbyterian yeoman of Horwich, Lancashire, England. The Writ of Summons by the monarch to the hereditary peerage in parliament of the successor created a second Barony of Parham in fee and inheritable by his heirs general. Passage 9:\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nHenry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham (1612\u20131617) was an English peer of the House of Lords. He was born in about November 1612, the son of William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham, and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland. On the death of his father in 1617, he succeeded as the 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham. However, he did not enjoy the title long, dying in infancy on about 14 October 1617. The barony was succeeded by his brother, Francis Willoughby. Passage 10:\nWilliam Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby of Parham\nWilliam Willoughby, 6th Lord Willoughby (c. 1616 \u2013 10 April 1673) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons and later in the House of Lords.",
      "His half-brother John Walton attended Glasgow University in 1736 and during the adult life of Hugh Willoughby all the Ministers at the Rivington Unitarian Chapel were from that University. His mother Ester Walton was interred at Horwich Parish Church on 16 Jan 1761. Succession\nIn 1733, Hugh Willoughby was challenged by a rival claimant to the peerage, Henry Willoughby, a descendant of Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and the case was referred to the Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Sir Philip York (later Lord Hardwicke) championed Hugh Willoughby's cause. As Henry Willoughby awaited his hearing, Hugh Willoughby spent his time travelling in Europe, his absence prevented the case being heard. However, on his return the case from Henry Willoughby was still not attended to by Hugh Willoughby or the Attorney General. Hugh Willoughby gained a writ of summons to the House of Lords and took his seat on 1 February 1734, despite a caveat: his rival's petition was read to the house. House of Lords\nIn his first year, he attended the Lords without missing a session. In the years 1735 to 1739, he was noted for his non-attendance, then after 1742 attended without fail. In addition to his duties in the Lords he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Society in 1752 and President of the Society of Antiquaries in 1754. Other positions included Vice-President of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, Trustee for the British Museum and a Commissioner on the Board of Longitude. From 1758 until 1762 he was governor at Rivington Grammar School and was a trustee of Blackrod Grammar School from 1736 although he did not attend meetings. He aided the foundation of the Warrington Academy. Hugh Willoughby chaired a committee of the House of Lords a year after taking his seat. Philip Yorke wrote that Willoughby was \"eminently useful in the dispatch of the ordinary business\" of the Lords, and \"had a thorough and accurate knowledge of the forms and usage of Parliament\". He played a significant role in committee work between 1739\u201340.",
      "School Governor\nHe was a governor of Rivington Grammar School during the Commonwealth and after Restoration from 1650 until 1691. The school lacked income between 1650 and 1660 so Thomas travelled to London, York and Durham for affidavits and trials and secured the rental income for the school. In the school's records he is noted as Gentleman of Horwich. He served as Chairman of Governors in 1651, 1653\u201354, 1653, 1670, 1676 and 1683. Succession\nThomas was called to parliament by writ 19 May 1685  subsequent to there being no other heir known at the time of the death of his cousin, Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1679. He was called to parliament as the 11th Baron Willoughby of Parham 1547 creation, however, the writ had created a new Barony and with it a new title of 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham (1685 creation).The title would have been inherited by Henry Willoughby, grandson of Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and great-grandson of Charles, the 2nd Baron. However, Henry Willoughby had emigrated to Virginia and his whereabouts was not known. The right to the first barony created by letters patent in 1547 was later claimed by a descendant of Henry Willoughby as 16th Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1767. Death\nThomas died in 1691 aged 89 and was buried under the chancel by the east window at the old Horwich Parish Church. Thomas was succeeded by his eldest son Hugh as the 12th Baron Willoughby of Parham, 2nd Baron of the 1685 creation. Passage 3:\nCharles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham\nCharles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham (c.1536/7 \u2013 d. 1610\u201312) was the only son of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, and Elizabeth Heneage. Family\nCharles Willoughby, born about 1536/7, was the only son of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, Suffolk, and his first wife, Elizabeth Heneage, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire, by Katherine Skipwith, daughter of Sir John Skipwith of Ormsby. Career\nWilloughby matriculated at St. John's College, Cambridge at Easter, 1549."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "The narrative of King of Battle relates Sargon's campaign against the Anatolian city of Purushanda in order to protect his merchants. Versions of this narrative in both Hittite and Akkadian have been found. The Hittite version is extant in six fragments, the Akkadian version is known from several manuscripts \nfound at Amarna, Assur, and Nineveh. The narrative is anachronistic, portraying Sargon in a 19th-century milieu. The same text mentions that Sargon crossed the Sea of the West (Mediterranean Sea) and ended up in Kuppara, which some authors have interpreted as the Akkadian word for Keftiu, an ancient locale usually associated with Crete or Cyprus. Famine and war threatened Sargon's empire during the latter years of his reign. The Chronicle of Early Kings reports that revolts broke out throughout the area under the last years of his overlordship:\n\nAfterward in his [Sargon's] old age all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad; and Sargon went onward to battle and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed. Afterward he attacked the land of Subartu in his might, and they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled that revolt, and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed, and he brought their possessions into Akkad. The soil from the trenches of Babylon he removed, and the boundaries of Akkad he made like those of Babylon. But because of the evil which he had committed, the great lord Marduk was angry, and he destroyed his people by famine. From the rising of the sun unto the setting of the sun they opposed him and gave him no rest. A. Leo Oppenheim translates the last sentence as \"From the East to the West he [i.e. Marduk] alienated (them) from him and inflicted upon (him as punishment) that he could not rest (in his grave). \"\n\nChronicle of Early Kings\nShortly after securing Sumer, Sargon embarked on a series of campaigns to subjugate the entire Fertile Crescent.",
      "According to the Chronicle of Early Kings, a later Babylonian historiographical text:\n\n[Sargon] had neither rival nor equal. His splendor, over the lands it diffused. He crossed the sea in the east. In the eleventh year he conquered the western land to its farthest point. He brought it under one authority. He set up his statues there and ferried the west's booty across on barges. He stationed his court officials at intervals of five double hours and ruled in unity the tribes of the lands. He marched to Kazallu and turned Kazallu into a ruin heap, so that there was not even a perch for a bird left. In the east, Sargon defeated four leaders of Elam, led by the king of Awan. Their cities were sacked; the governors, viceroys, and kings of Susa, Wara\u1e2b\u0161e, and neighboring districts became vassals of Akkad. Origin legends\nSargon became the subject of legendary narratives describing his rise to power from humble origins and his conquest of Mesopotamia in later Assyrian and Babylonian literature. Apart from these secondary, and partly legendary, accounts, there are many inscriptions due to Sargon himself, although the majority of these are known only from much later copies. The Louvre has fragments of two Sargonic victory steles recovered from Susa (where\nthey were presumably transported from Mesopotamia in the 12th century BC). Sumerian legend\nThe Sumerian-language Sargon legend contains a legendary account of Sargon's rise to power. It is an older version of the previously known Assyrian legend, discovered in 1974 in Nippur and first edited in 1983.The extant versions are incomplete, but the surviving fragments name Sargon's father as La'ibum. After a lacuna, the text skips to Ur-Zababa, king of Kish, who awakens after a dream, the contents of which are not revealed on the surviving portion of the tablet. For unknown reasons, Ur-Zababa appoints Sargon as his cup-bearer. Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess Inanna and the drowning of Ur-Zababa by the goddess in a river of blood.",
      "An older version of the king list gives Sargon's reign as lasting for 40 years. Thorkild Jacobsen marked the clause about Sargon's father being a gardener as a lacuna, indicating his uncertainty about its meaning. Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but separated by several additional named rulers of Kish, who seem to have been merely governors or vassals under the Akkadian Empire. The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has been called into question with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of Enshakushanna, who almost certainly preceded him. The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19:51) states that it was Sargon who \"built Babylon in front of Akkad.\" The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20:18\u201319) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon \"dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade.\" Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than to Sargon of Akkad. Some of the regnal year names of Sargon are preserved, and throw some light in the events of his reign, particularly the conquest of the surrounding territories of Simurrum, Elam and Mari, and Uru'a, thought to be a city in Elam: Year in which Sargon went to Simurrum\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Uru'a\nYear in which Uru'a was destroyed\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Elam\nYear in which Mari was destroyed\n\nHistoriography\nLanguage and script used in records\nSargon appears to have promoted the use of Semitic (Akkadian) in inscriptions. He frequently calls himself \"king of Akkad\" first, after he apparently founded the city of Akkad. He appears to have taken over the rule of Kish at some point, and later also much of Mesopotamia, referring to himself as\n\"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". During Sargon's reign, East Semitic was standardized and adapted for use with the cuneiform script previously used in the Sumerian language into what is now known as the \"Akkadian language\".",
      "A style of calligraphy developed in which text on clay tablets and cylinder seals was arranged amidst scenes of mythology and ritual. Year names\nWhile various copies of the Sumerian king list and later Babylonian chronicles credit Sargon with a reign length ranging from 34 to 56 years, dated documents have been found for only four different year-names of his actual reign. The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum (a Hurrian region), and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state). Nippur inscription\nAmong the most important sources for Sargon's reign is a tablet of the Old Babylonian period recovered at Nippur in the University of Pennsylvania expedition in the 1890s. The tablet is a copy of the inscriptions on the pedestal of a statue erected by Sargon in the temple of Enlil. Its text was edited by Arno Poebel (1909) and Leon Legrain (1926). Conquest of Sumer\nIn the inscription, Sargon styles himself \"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer (mashkim) of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed (guda) of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". It celebrates the conquest of Uruk and the defeat of Lugalzagesi, whom Sargon brought \"in a collar to the gate of Enlil\":\nSargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land, governor of Enlil: he defeated the city of Uruk and tore down its walls, in the battle of Uruk he won, took Lugalzagesi king of Uruk in the course of the battle, and led him in a collar to the gate of Enlil. Sargon then conquered Ur and E-Ninmar and \"laid waste\" the territory from Lagash to the sea, and from there went on to conquer and destroy Umma:\nSargon, king of Agade, was victorious over Ur in battle, conquered the city and destroyed its wall. He conquered Eninmar, destroyed its walls, and conquered its district and Lagash as far as the sea. He washed his weapons in the sea. He was victorious over Umma in battle, [conquered the city, and destroyed its walls]. [To Sargon], lo[rd] of the land the god Enlil"

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294\u201395, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north. Private war in the Marches\nParallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum.",
      "The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony. At the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances. Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king.",
      "For Edward, a further provocation came from Llywelyn's planned marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort the Elder. In November 1276, Edward declared war. Initial operations were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Edward's brother Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded with a force of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised he had no choice but to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was left only with the land of Gwynedd, though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales. When war broke out again in 1282, it was an entirely different undertaking. For the Welsh, this war was over national identity, enjoying wide support, provoked particularly by attempts to impose English law on Welsh subjects. For Edward, it became a war of conquest rather than simply a punitive expedition, like the former campaign. The war started with a rebellion by Dafydd, who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277. Llywelyn and other Welsh chieftains soon joined in, and initially the Welsh experienced military success. In June, Gloucester was defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr. On 6 November, while John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, was conducting peace negotiations, Edward's commander of Anglesey, Luke de Tany, decided to carry out a surprise attack. A pontoon bridge had been built to the mainland, but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over, they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Moel-y-don. The Welsh advances ended on 11 December, when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge. The conquest of Gwynedd was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor the following autumn; Edward ordered Dafydd's head to be publicly exhibited on London Bridge.",
      "His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons' War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)'s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose. Bohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282\u201383 and 1294\u201395. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartarum\u2014a confirmation of Magna Carta\u2014and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. Family background and inheritance\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle."

She was duchess of Saxe-Meiningen by marriage to George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, and Regent of Saxe-Meiningen during the minority of her son from 1803 to 1821. Life\nLouise Eleonore was a daughter of Prince Christian Albert Louis of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1726-1789) and his wife Princess Caroline of Stolberg-Gedern (1732\u20131796). On 27 November 1782, in Langenburg, she married George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Regency\nWhen her husband died on 24 December 1803, she took over as regent of the duchy for their son Bernhard II. She ruled with energy, courage, and good sense during the Napoleonic Wars, which for the next decade ravaged the Saxon states. The duchy was forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine during these Wars and provide it with troops; afterwards the duchy was struck with famine, which Luise sought to prevent by importing wheat. French armies, and later those of Russia, marched back and forth across the country, but Luise refused to flee; she stayed with her infant son and two daughters inside their castle. She used every strategy to preserve the autonomy of her regency, so that when she joined the Allies in 1813, she had saved the duchy for her son. He became the ruling Duke of Meiningen eight years later. By adjustments in the duchy's administration she ensured the duchy was better managed and in 1821 opened the Gymnasium Bernhardinum in Meiningen (already begun by her husband). Her children were carefully educated, with a grand tour to Italy under their tutor Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. After her son came of age, Luise retired as regent and went on several foreign trips, including one to England to visit her daughter Adelaide. Issue\nAdelheid  (later Adelaide, 13 August 1792 \u2013 2 December 1849), with whom Luise had a very close relationship; in 1818 she married King William IV of the United Kingdom while Luise was regent and special taxes needed to be instituted in the duchy to raise funds for her enormous dowry (6,000 florins per year)."

Devereux-Mills first served as a director on the Marchex board beginning in 2006, and was appointed Chairman in October 2016. Marchex is a leader in mobile marketing and call analytics. She was also on the Board of Lantern, a company that brought Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to people through mobile technology, thereby expanded access to clinical help and reduced the cost of care. Combining her career success, her interest in creating opportunities to connect and empower women as well as her natural leadership skills, Devereux-Mills is now a public speaker, who is focusing on issues of female empowerment, reframing reciprocity, and creating a new version of feminism that can address the issues so prevalent in our society. Book: The Parlay Effect\nIn The Parlay Effect: The Transformative Power of Female Connection, Anne Devereux-Mills uses her insights as Founder of Parlay House to show how small actions can result in a meaningful boost in self-awareness, confidence and vision. Through a combination of scientific research and personal stories, The Parlay Effect offers a blueprint for anyone who is going through a life transition who wants to find and create communities that have a positive and multiplying effect in their impact.

      "Career\nDevereux-Mills began her career in the Political Risk Department of Marsh and McLennan in New York City, but after just a few years, realized that her strengths lay elsewhere. Parlaying her skills in communications and client management through a series of career experiments, she found herself in the field of advertising where she specialized in healthcare. Once landing in a field that combined her strengths and her passions, she quickly climbed the corporate ladder, helping found the first Direct-to-consumer advertising agency for healthcare brands, called Consumer Healthworks, part of WPP. A few years later, she moved to Omnicom Group, building a direct to consumer practice for Harrison and Star where she went on to become president, then to Merkley and Partners where she was CEO of the Healthcare Division.

She then transitioned to TBWA\\Chiat\\Day as CEO of the global healthcare practice as well as chairman and CEO of LLNS.Devereux-Mills left the field of advertising in 2009. Hit with the triple threat of progressing cancer, opting to have cancer surgery, Devereux-Mills moved to San Francisco where she founded Parlay House, a salon-style gathering for women that now has a national presence and thousands of members who come together to connect about what they care about rather than what they \"do\".

      "C) Marie Louise was always supportive of Napoleon's political decisions.",
      "D) Napoleon and Marie Louise had a harmonious marriage with no conflicts."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Napoleon was delighted that his wife survived the ordeal and said: \"I had rather never have any more children than see her suffer so much again. \"Marie Louise was devoted to her son; she had him brought to her every morning and visited him in his apartment in the course of the day. Resumption of war\nIn May 1812, a month before the French invasion of Russia, Marie Louise accompanied Napoleon to Dresden, where she met her father and stepmother. Emperor Francis told Napoleon he could count on Austria for the \"triumph of the common cause\", a reference to the impending war. A minor rivalry began to develop between Marie Louise and the Empress of Austria, who was jealous at being upstaged in appearance by her stepdaughter. It was also in Dresden where she met Count Adam Albert von Neipperg for the first time. Napoleon left Dresden on 29 May to take charge of his army. Marie Louise then travelled to Prague, where she spent a few weeks with the Austrian Imperial family, before returning to Saint Cloud on 18 July. She kept in touch with Napoleon throughout the war. The invasion of Russia ended disastrously for France. More than half of the Grande Arm\u00e9e was destroyed by the Russian Winter and guerrilla attacks. After the failed Malet coup of October 1812, Napoleon hastened his return to France and reunited with his wife on the night of 18 December. Collapse of the Empire\nThe weakened French position triggered the Sixth Coalition. Prussia allied with Russia and declared war on France (the United Kingdom was already at war with France), but Austria stayed out due to relations between the Imperial families. On 30 March, Marie Louise was appointed Regent as Napoleon set off for battle in Germany. The regency was only de jure, as all decisions were still taken by Napoleon and implemented by his most senior officials, including Lebrun, Joseph Bonaparte, Talleyrand and Savary. Marie Louise tried unsuccessfully to get her father to ally with France. Austria too joined the opposition to France. She maintained a correspondence with Napoleon, informing him of increasing demands for peace in Paris and the provinces.",
      "Their journey was hampered by bad weather, and they arrived in Buda \"wet through, and nearly worn out with fatigue\". Marriage proposal\nAfter escaping an assassination attempt in Vienna, while negotiating the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn on 12 October 1809, Emperor Napoleon decided that he needed an heir to cement his relatively young Empire. He also sought the validation and legitimization of his Empire by marrying a member of one of the leading royal families of Europe. He began proceedings to divorce Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, who did not bear him a son, and began searching for a new empress. His wish to marry Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia, the youngest sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, caused alarm in Austria, who were afraid of being sandwiched between two great powers allied with each other. At the persuasion of Prince Metternich, a marriage between Napoleon and Marie Louise was suggested by Emperor Francis to the Count of Narbonne but no official overture was made by the Austrians. Though officials in Paris and Austria were beginning to accept the possibility of the union, Marie Louise was kept uninformed of developments. Frustrated by the Russians delaying the marriage negotiations, Napoleon rescinded his proposal in late January 1810 and began negotiations to marry Marie Louise with the Austrian ambassador, the Prince of Schwarzenberg. Schwarzenberg signed the marriage contract on 7 February. Marie Louise was informed of the marriage by Metternich. When asked for consent, she replied: \"I wish only what my duty commands me to wish. \"\n\nWedding\nMarie Louise was married by proxy to Napoleon on 11 March 1810 at the Augustinian Church, Vienna. Napoleon was represented by Archduke Charles, the bride's uncle. According to the French ambassador, the marriage \"was celebrated with a magnificence that it would be hard to surpass, by the side of which even the brilliant festivities that have preceded it are not to be mentioned\". She became Empress of the French and Queen of Italy. Marie Louise departed Vienna on 13 March, probably expecting never to return.",
      "Napoleon was decisively defeated in Leipzig on 19 October and returned to Saint Cloud on 9 November. On 23 January 1814, Marie Louise was appointed Regent for the second time. On 25 January, at 03:00 in the morning, Napoleon embraced Marie Louise and his son for the last time. He left to lead a hastily formed army to stave off the Allied invasion from the north. As the Allies neared Paris, Marie Louise was reluctant to leave. She felt that as the daughter of the sovereign of Austria, one of the allied members, she would be treated with respect by Allied forces, with the possibility of her son succeeding the throne should Napoleon be deposed. She was also afraid that her departure would strengthen the royalist supporters of the Bourbons. Marie Louise was finally persuaded to leave by Henri Clarke, who received the order from Napoleon: \"I would prefer to know that they [the Empress and the King of Rome] are both at the bottom of the Seine rather than in the hands of the foreigners.\" On 29 March, the court left Paris. The Allies entered the city the following day. Marie Louise and the court moved to Blois, which was safe from the Allies. She did not expect her father to dethrone Napoleon and deprive her son of the crown of France. On 3 April, the Senate, at the instigation of Talleyrand, announced the deposition of the Emperor. Marie Louise was unaware of this until 7 April, and was astonished to discover the turn of events. She wanted to return to Paris, but was dissuaded from doing so by physician Jean-Nicolas Corvisart and the Duchess of Montebello. Exile of Napoleon\nNapoleon abdicated the throne on 11 April 1814 in Fontainebleau. The Treaty of Fontainebleau exiled him to Elba, allowed Marie Louise to retain her imperial rank and style and made her ruler of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, with her son as heir. This arrangement was later revised at the Congress of Vienna. Marie Louise was strongly dissuaded from rejoining her husband by her advisors, who fed her accounts that Napoleon was distraught with grief over the death of Jos\u00e9phine.",
      "He \"spared no pains\" to please her and claimed at one point to prefer Marie Louise to his first wife Jos\u00e9phine; while he had loved Jos\u00e9phine, and though he claimed Jos\u00e9phine remained his greatest friend even after their amicable divorce, he had not respected her, whereas with Marie Louise, there was \"Never a lie, never a debt\" \u2014 presumably a reference to Jos\u00e9phine's rumoured extramarital affairs and reputation as a spendthrift. Marie Louise wrote to her father: \"I assure you, dear papa, that people have done great injustice to the Emperor. The better one knows him, the better one appreciates and loves him.\" However, the marriage was not without tension; Napoleon sometimes remarked to aides that Marie Louise was too shy and timid, compared to the outgoing and passionate Josephine, with whom he remained in close contact, upsetting Marie Louise. The excitement surrounding the wedding ushered in a period of peace and friendship between France and Austria, who had been largely at war for the last two decades. The people of Vienna, who hated Napoleon only months before, were suddenly in full praise of the French Emperor. Flattering letters were sent between Napoleon and Emperor Francis, Empress Maria Ludovika Beatrix and Archduke Charles during the wedding festivities. During public occasions, Marie Louise spoke little due to reserve and timidity, which some observers mistook for haughtiness. She was regarded as a virtuous woman and never interfered in politics. Privately, she was polite and gentle. Napoleon arranged for Marie Louise to participate in some carefully selected charity assignments, most notably the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Charit\u00e9 Maternelle, for which he made her Honorary President. Birth of first child\nMarie Louise became pregnant by July 1810 and gave birth to a son on 20 March 1811. The boy, Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, was given the title King of Rome, in accordance with the practice where the heir apparent to the Holy Roman Empire was called the King of the Romans."

That agency, which was known in the early days as Roman Press Agency, was the seed for what was to become the Inter Press Service (IPS) news agency, which was formally established at a meeting in the Schloss Eichholz conference centre of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (the foundation of the CDU), in Wesseling near Bonn, then the capital city of West Germany.

      "He is now a member of the Board. He is Deputy Director of the Scientific Council of the New Policy Forum (formerly the World Policy Forum), founded by Mikhail Gorbachev and based in Luxembourg, to provide a space for reflection and new thinking on the current international situation by influential global leaders. Roberto Savio is responsible for international relations of the European Centre for Peace and Development, based in Belgrade, whose mission is to contribute to peace and development in Europe and to international cooperation in the transfer of knowledge based on the premise that development under conditions of peace is only possible when conceived as human development. Roberto Savio is Chairman of Accademia Panisperna, a cultural meeting space in the centre of Rome, and is President of Arcoiris TV, an online TV channel with the world\u2019s largest collection of videos and registrations of political and cultural events (over 70,000 hours), based in Modena, Italy.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "documentation": [
      "Thompson confirmed this in an interview, and Hampshire and Henry were less forthcoming to the press. In September, Hopper reported that it was over between Thompson and Hampshire. Henry and Thompson were divorced in the late 1960s. In November 1962, Thompson said he had proposed to Shirley Ann Field whom he said accepted then changed her mind. His third wife was Penny, who was his widow. Death\nThompson died of congestive heart failure on 30 August 2002, at his holiday home in Sooke, British Columbia, aged 88. Critical appraisal\nThe Guardian obituary called him \"a compelling craftsman\". The Washington Post said \"he directed adventure films noted for their punchy pacing, rich atmosphere and nuanced characterization.\" Variety said he was \"Known as a craftsman who had a clear sense of how each film should play, scene by scene\". The Independent said \"he lent his acute sense of atmosphere and vivid visual style to a wide range of material. His intimate kitchen-sink melodramas... were unflinching portraits of social realism unusually stark for their time. His thrillers were tautly edited exercises in suspense, and he also made some engaging comedies and a bracing musical... Though his later films can most kindly be labelled potboilers, his body of work in the Fifties and early Sixties was an impressive one. \"In 2000 he stated that he made so many American films \"because of my insecurity and effort to stay here. If I was given a script and it had something good in it I'd say, 'Good, I've got my next picture!' That is not the way to make good films, so some of them were good and some not so good.... What an idiot! 'You should have stayed at what you really wanted to make.' If I have anything to say to young directors today it's don't make a film for the sake of making it. Make it only if you really believe in it. Then success will eventually come to you. \"\n\nAwards\nNominated, Best Director Academy Award, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Director Directors Guild of America, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Director Golden Globe, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nWinner, Best Film Golden Globe, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Film BAFTA, Tiger Bay (1959)",
      "It was one of the most popular films in Britain in 1959.No Trees in the Street (1959) was a thriller written by Willis. Also in that genre was Tiger Bay (1959), starring John Mills. It introduced cinema audiences to Mills' daughter Hayley and German actor Horst Buchholz. Hayley Mills also earned a BAFTA for Most Promising Newcomer portraying a 12-year-old girl who refuses to betray a sailor accused of murder. Thompson followed this with I Aim at the Stars (1960). Hollywood career\nGuns of Navarone and Cape Fear\nThompson vaulted to international fame with The Guns of Navarone (1961) as a last-minute replacement for director Alexander Mackendrick. His take-charge attitude during its production earned him the nickname 'Mighty Mouse' from lead actor Gregory Peck. Co-star Anthony Quinn said Thompson:\n\nNever read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim. And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing. Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention, in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own. Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain, and nurture, the one form that could, in turn, sustain and nurture him. Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass. The Guns of Navarone, a World War II epic filmed on location in Rhodes, Greece, was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Thompson for Best Director. In 1961 he said \"primarily I am in the business to entertain. This does not mean that I never want to try artistic movies again. But I do not think you can sell art on the big movie circuits. Art belongs in the art houses.\" Later he said \"I liked the character bits best\" about Navarone. \"Anyone can make an explosion. \"The success of Navarone won him entry into Hollywood, where he directed Cape Fear (1962), a psychological thriller with Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen and Lori Martin; Peck and Mitchum co-producing the film.",
      "The film paired the actors Chuck Norris with Louis Gossett Jr. as its leads. The action adventure co-stars Will Sampson and Melody Anderson. Norris and Gossett play Max Donigan and Leo Porter, two soldiers of fortune, whose adventures rarely result in any notable gain. They are befriended by an inscrutable woman of mystery Patricia (Anderson). Patricia's map leads them on a quest for treasure in Central America. The name of the movie comes from the powerful guardian of the treasure. Now working exclusively for Cannon, Thompson made two more Charles Bronson thrillers. On 6 November 1987 Death Wish 4: The Crackdown was released and 16 September 1988 saw the opening of Messenger of Death. He later reflected, \"I realized these films were not going to enhance my reputation. I had to live with that. You're not going to be offered the great films at a certain age. \"3 February 1989, Thompson's final directorial effort was released Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects starring Charles Bronson. In 1990 Thompson moved to Sooke. In 1992 Thompson said he was trying to finance a remake of Tiger Bay with Anna Chumsky and Alec Baldwin. The director said \"I have certain regrets now. I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance. But the British film industry caved in. I shouldn't denigrate myself too much because I have enjoyed making my films but I suppose I sort of sold out.\" Personal life\nThompson was married three times. His first wife was Florence Bailey, whom he married in 1935 when he was 20. They had a son, Peter (1938\u20131997), who became a film editor on several of his father's films and predeceased him, and a daughter, Lesley, who survived him. They divorced in 1957. His second wife was prisoner and author Joan Henry, whom he married in 1958. They collaborated on Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night. He left her for actress Susan Hampshire. In March 1962 Hedda Hopper reported that Thompson was \"sweating it out\" in Los Angeles while Henry and Hampshire were \"awaiting his decision in London.\"",
      "High Citadel was never filmed. Another film announced but never filmed was The Case Against Colonel Sutton which he was going to do with producer Martin Poll. Neither was a proposed musical remake of The Private Lives of Henry VIII.After a war film, Before Winter Comes (1968) Thompson was reunited with the star, producer and writer of Navarone in the Western Mackenna's Gold (1969) but it did poorly at the box office. So too did the espionage tale The Chairman (1969) with Gregory Peck. He was meant to follow that with You?, about assassination from a script by Andrew Sinclair. It was never filmed. \"I freely admit I've done some pretty bad stuff,\" he said in 1968. \"It's entirely my own fault. The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts. I wasn't tough enough... Writing is the fundamental thing.\" Some have argued that Thompson's creative decline coincided with the end of his relationship with Henry. Apes Movies\nBack in the UK he directed Country Dance, also known as Brotherly Love (1970). Thompson's handling of a smaller scale film impressed producer Arthur Jacobs, with whom Thompson had made What a Way to Go; Thompson was the first director attached to the Jacobs production The Planet of the Apes and Thompson says he turned down the first two sequels. He was available to make the fourth and fifth movies in the series, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Writer Paul Dehn said Thompson had a reputation as someone with a drinking problem but that he had overcome it by the time of the Apes films. \"They were cutting back on the budgets the whole time after the first one\", said Thompson later. \"It was a bad policy.\"\n\nLater career\nUS Television\nThompson began working more in US television, directing the television films A Great American Tragedy (1972), Huckleberry Finn (1974) starring Jeff East and Paul Winfield, The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1974) and Widow (1976) as well as the pilot episode of The Blue Knight (1975). He returned to playwriting with Getting Away with Murder (1976)."

      "Ispahani moved to Dubai in 1996, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, she was kept out of public's eye by Benazir until her demise on 23 October 2011. In Pakistan, Ispahani is remembered for her contribution to empowerment of women in Pakistan and for advocating for democracy in Pakistan, for which she is dubbed as \"M\u0101dar-e-Jamhooriat\" (English \"Mother of Democracy\"), a title she was honored with by the parliament following her death. Early life, background and political career\nNusrat Ispahani was born on 23 March 1929 in Isfahan, Persia (now Iran). Her father was a wealthy businessman who came from the wealthy Hariri family of merchants in Isfahan and was of partial Kurdish descent via his mother who came from Kurdistan Province. Shortly after her birth, the family later moved to British India, where they initially lived in Bombay and then moved to Karachi before the independence of Pakistan and the Partition of India in 1947. She grew up with Iranian traditions at her home but adapted to Indian Muslim culture outside. Before emigrating to Pakistan, Nusrat attended and was educated at the University of Karachi where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Humanities in 1950. As first lady from 1973 to 1977, Nusrat Bhutto functioned as a political worker and accompanied her husband on a number of overseas visits. In 1979, after the trial and execution of her husband, she succeeded her husband as leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party as chairman for life. She led the PPP's campaign against General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's regime. Alongside her daughter Benazir Bhutto, she was arrested numerous times and placed under house arrest and in prison in Sihala. Nusrat Bhutto was attacked by police with batons while attending a cricket match at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, when the crowd began to raise pro Bhutto slogans. In 1982, ill with cancer, she was given permission to leave the country by the military government of General Zia-ul-Haq for medical treatment in London at which point her daughter, Benazir Bhutto, became acting leader of the party, and, by 1984, the party chairman.",
      "Passage 1:\nNusrat Bhutto\nBegum Nusrat Bhutto (n\u00e9e: Nusrat Ispahani; Persian: \u200c\u0646\u0635\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0648; Sindhi: \u0646\u0635\u0631\u062a \u0680\u067d\u0648; Urdu: \u0646\u064f\u0635\u0631\u062a \u0628\u064f\u06be\u0679\u0651\u0648; 23 March 1929 \u2013 23 October 2011) was an Iranian-born Pakistani public figure of Kurdish origin, who served as the First Lady of Pakistan between 1971 until the 1977 coup, and as a senior member of the federal cabinet between 1988 and 1990. She was born in Isfahan to a wealthy merchant family of Kurdish heritage and her family had settled in Bombay before moving to Karachi after the Partition of British India. Ispahani joined a paramilitary women's force in 1950, but left a year later when she married Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She moved to Oxfordshire with her husband who then was pursuing his legal education. She returned to Pakistan alongside Bhutto who went on to serve as the Foreign Minister. After her husband founded the Pakistan Peoples Party, Ispahani worked to lead the party's women's wing. After Bhutto was elected as the Prime Minister in 1971, Ispahani became the First Lady of Pakistan and remained so until her husband's removal in 1977. Her daughter, Benazir Bhutto immediately succeeded her husband as the leader of the Pakistan Peoples party and, while under house arrest, fought an unsuccessful legal battle to prevent her husband's execution. After Bhutto's execution, Ispahani, along with her children, went into exile to London, from where in 1981 she co-founded the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, a nonviolent opposition to Zia's regime. Ispahani returned to Pakistan after her daughter Benazir made a comeback in 1986. After the People's Party's victory in 1988, she joined Benazir's cabinet as a minister without portfolio while representing Larkana District in the National Assembly. She remained in the cabinet until Benazir's government was dismissed in 1990. Afterwards, during a family dispute between her son, Murtaza, and her daughter, Benazir, Ispahani favored Murtaza leading Benazir to sack Ispahani as the party leader. Ispahani stopped talking to the media and refrained from political engagements after the assassination of her son Murtaza in 1996 during a police encounter, during her daughter's second government."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "documentation": [
      "The form \u0160arru-uk\u012bn was known from the Assyrian Sargon Legend discovered in 1867 in Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. A contemporary reference to Sargon thought to have been found on the cylinder seal of Ibni-sharru, a high-ranking official serving under Sargon. Joachim Menant published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as Shegani-shar-lukh, and did not yet identify it with \"Sargon the Elder\" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king Sargon I). In 1883, the British Museum acquired the \"mace-head of Shar-Gani-sharri\", a votive gift deposited at the temple of Shamash in Sippar. This \"Shar-Gani\" was identified with the Sargon of Agade of Assyrian legend. The identification of \"Shar-Gani-sharri\" with Sargon was recognised as mistaken in the 1910s. Shar-Gani-sharri (Shar-Kali-Sharri) is, in fact, Sargon's great-grandson, the successor of Naram-Sin. It is not entirely clear whether the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II was directly named for Sargon of Akkad, as there is some uncertainty whether his name should be rendered \u0160arru-uk\u012bn or as \u0160arru-k\u0113n(u). Chronology\nPrimary sources pertaining to Sargon are sparse; the main near-contemporary reference is that in the various versions of the Sumerian King List. Here, Sargon is mentioned as the son of a gardener, former cup-bearer of Ur-Zababa of Kish. He usurped the kingship from Lugal-zage-si of Uruk and took it to his own city of Akkad. Note that the Weidner chronicle has Sargon ruling directly after Ur-Zababa and does not mention Lugal-zage-si. Various copies of the king list give the duration of his reign as either 40 or 54-56 years. Numerous fragmentary inscriptions relating to Sargon are also known. In absolute years, his reign would correspond to c. 2334\u20132279 BC in the middle chronology. His successors until the Gutian conquest of Sumer are also known as the \"Sargonic Dynasty\" and their rule as the \"Sargonic Period\" of Mesopotamian history. Foster (1982) argued that the reading of 55 years as the duration of Sargon's reign was, in fact, a corruption of an original interpretation of 37 years.",
      "He is sometimes identified as the first person in recorded history to rule over an empire. He was the founder of the \"Sargonic\" or \"Old Akkadian\" dynasty, which ruled for about a century after his death until the Gutian conquest of Sumer. The Sumerian king list makes him the cup-bearer to king Ur-Zababa of Kish. His empire is thought to have included most of Mesopotamia, parts of the Levant, besides incursions into Hurrian and Elamite territory, ruling from his (archaeologically as yet unidentified) capital, Akkad. Sargon appears as a legendary figure in Neo-Assyrian literature of the 8th to 7th centuries BC. Tablets with fragments of a Sargon Birth Legend were found in the Library of Ashurbanipal. Name\nThe Akkadian name is normalized as either \u0160arru-uk\u012bn or \u0160arru-k\u0113n. The name's cuneiform spelling is variously LUGAL-\u00fa-kin, \n\u0161ar-ru-gen6, \u0161ar-ru-ki-in, \u0161ar-ru-um-ki-in. In Old Babylonian tablets relating the legends of Sargon, his name is transcribed as \ud808\udeac\ud808\ude92\ud808\udf1d\ud808\udd00\ud808\udd54 (\u0160ar-ru-um-ki-in). In Late Assyrian references, the name is mostly spelled as LUGAL-GI.NA or LUGAL-GIN, i.e. identical to the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II. The spelling Sargon is derived from the single mention of the name (in reference to Sargon II) in the Hebrew Bible, as \u05e1\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d2\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, in Isaiah 20:1. The first element in the name is \u0161arru, the Akkadian (East Semitic) for \"king\" (c.f. Hebrew \u015bar \u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05e8). The second element is derived from the verb k\u012bnum \"to confirm, establish\" (related to Hebrew k\u016bn \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05df).A possible interpretation of the reading \u0160arru-uk\u012bn is \"the king has established (stability)\" or \"he [the god] has established the king\". Such a name would however be unusual; other names in -uk\u012bn always include both a subject and an object, as in \u0160ama\u0161-\u0161uma-uk\u012bn \"Shamash has established an heir\". There is some debate over whether the name was an adopted regnal name or a birth name. The reading \u0160arru-k\u0113n has been interpreted adjectivally, as \"the king is established; legitimate\", expanded as a phrase \u0161arrum ki(e)num. The terms \"Pre-Sargonic\" and \"Post-Sargonic\" were used in Assyriology based on the chronologies of Nabonidus before the historical existence of Sargon of Akkad was confirmed.",
      "An older version of the king list gives Sargon's reign as lasting for 40 years. Thorkild Jacobsen marked the clause about Sargon's father being a gardener as a lacuna, indicating his uncertainty about its meaning. Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but separated by several additional named rulers of Kish, who seem to have been merely governors or vassals under the Akkadian Empire. The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has been called into question with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of Enshakushanna, who almost certainly preceded him. The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19:51) states that it was Sargon who \"built Babylon in front of Akkad.\" The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20:18\u201319) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon \"dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade.\" Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than to Sargon of Akkad. Some of the regnal year names of Sargon are preserved, and throw some light in the events of his reign, particularly the conquest of the surrounding territories of Simurrum, Elam and Mari, and Uru'a, thought to be a city in Elam: Year in which Sargon went to Simurrum\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Uru'a\nYear in which Uru'a was destroyed\nYear in which Sargon destroyed Elam\nYear in which Mari was destroyed\n\nHistoriography\nLanguage and script used in records\nSargon appears to have promoted the use of Semitic (Akkadian) in inscriptions. He frequently calls himself \"king of Akkad\" first, after he apparently founded the city of Akkad. He appears to have taken over the rule of Kish at some point, and later also much of Mesopotamia, referring to himself as\n\"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". During Sargon's reign, East Semitic was standardized and adapted for use with the cuneiform script previously used in the Sumerian language into what is now known as the \"Akkadian language\".",
      "A style of calligraphy developed in which text on clay tablets and cylinder seals was arranged amidst scenes of mythology and ritual. Year names\nWhile various copies of the Sumerian king list and later Babylonian chronicles credit Sargon with a reign length ranging from 34 to 56 years, dated documents have been found for only four different year-names of his actual reign. The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum (a Hurrian region), and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state). Nippur inscription\nAmong the most important sources for Sargon's reign is a tablet of the Old Babylonian period recovered at Nippur in the University of Pennsylvania expedition in the 1890s. The tablet is a copy of the inscriptions on the pedestal of a statue erected by Sargon in the temple of Enlil. Its text was edited by Arno Poebel (1909) and Leon Legrain (1926). Conquest of Sumer\nIn the inscription, Sargon styles himself \"Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer (mashkim) of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed (guda) of Anu, king of the land [Mesopotamia], governor (ensi) of Enlil\". It celebrates the conquest of Uruk and the defeat of Lugalzagesi, whom Sargon brought \"in a collar to the gate of Enlil\":\nSargon, king of Akkad, overseer of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed of Anu, king of the land, governor of Enlil: he defeated the city of Uruk and tore down its walls, in the battle of Uruk he won, took Lugalzagesi king of Uruk in the course of the battle, and led him in a collar to the gate of Enlil. Sargon then conquered Ur and E-Ninmar and \"laid waste\" the territory from Lagash to the sea, and from there went on to conquer and destroy Umma:\nSargon, king of Agade, was victorious over Ur in battle, conquered the city and destroyed its wall. He conquered Eninmar, destroyed its walls, and conquered its district and Lagash as far as the sea. He washed his weapons in the sea. He was victorious over Umma in battle, [conquered the city, and destroyed its walls]. [To Sargon], lo[rd] of the land the god Enlil"

He died without a male heir on 9 December 1679. The first creation by letters patent stipulated the title must pass to heirs male of Sir William Willoughby 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham. Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham died without issue and left his estate to his niece Elizabeth, who had married James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Second Creation\nOn the death of the 10th Lord Willoughby, the title should have passed to the line of the next son of Charles 2nd Lord Willoughby, who was Sir Ambrose Willoughby, and then through his line to the eldest son, Edward Willoughby, and then Henry; however the family had emigrated to Virginia and it was believed this male line was extinct. The title passed instead through the line of Thomas the youngest son of Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham and his sons to Thomas Willoughby, who had married Eleanor Whittle, daughter of Hugh Whittle, a staunch Presbyterian yeoman of Horwich, Lancashire, England. The Writ of Summons by the monarch to the hereditary peerage in parliament of the successor created a second Barony of Parham in fee and inheritable by his heirs general.

      "D) The Lordship of Galloway was inherited by Alan's nephew, Adam de Kilconquhar, who married Gille Brigte's great-granddaughter Marjorie."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "documentation": [
      "Gilla Brigte was one of two sons of the great Fergus, the builder of the \"Kingdom\" of Galloway. Background, marriage and family\nIn the struggle that arose after the death of Fergus between Gille Brigte and Uchtred, Gille Brigte emerged the stronger. The partitioning of Galloway left Gille Brigte with the western part, the part less exposed to the armies of the Scottish and English Kings. We do not know for certain to whom Gille Brigte was married. Richard Oram suggests the strong likelihood that his main wife was a daughter of Donnchad II, Mormaer or Earl of Fife and the most important native lord in Scotland. The introduction of the name Donnchad (or Duncan) into the family naming pattern is some evidence of this, as is the later marriage of Gille Brigte's great-granddaughter Marjorie to the Fife petty-lord Adam de Kilconquhar. Gille Brigte had two known children: Donnchad\nM\u00e1el Coluim\n\nEvents of 1174 & approach to England\nFrom 1161 until 1174, Gille Brigte and Uchtred shared the lordship, with Gille Brigte in the west, and Uchtred in the east. In 1174, King William le Lion of Scotland invaded England in an attempt to regain Northumberland. He brought with him the two meic Fergusa, Gille Brigte and Uchtred. During the invasion, William was caught off-guard, and captured while besieging the castle at Alnwick. Benedict of Peterborough reported that:\n\nWhen they [the brothers] heard that their lord the king of Scotland was taken, they immediately returned with their Galwegians to their own lands, and at once expelled from Galloway all the bailiffs and guards whom the king of Scotland had set over them; and all the English and French whom they could seize they slew; and all the defences and castles which the king of Scotland had established in their land they besieged, captured and destroyed, and slew all whom they took within them\nDespite the implications that both brothers were involved, it is clear that only Gilla Brigte was, and that Uchtred opposed him. For Benedict goes on to tell us that, in relation to the same year, Gille Brigte's son M\u00e1el Coluim was besieging Uchtred on an island in Galloway.",
      "Like other members of his family, he was a generous religious patron. Alan died in February 1234. Although under the traditional Celtic custom of Galloway, Alan's illegitimate son could have succeeded to the Lordship of Galloway, under the feudal custom of the Scottish realm, Alan's nearest heirs were his surviving daughters. Using Alan's death as an opportunity to further integrate Galloway within his realm, Alexander forced the partition of the lordship amongst Alan's daughters. Alan was the last legitimate ruler of Galloway, descending from the native dynasty of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Background\nAlan was born sometime before 1199. He was the eldest son of Lochlann of Galloway, Frenchified as Roland, and his wife, Helen de Morville. His parents were likely married before 1185, possibly at some point in the 1170s, since Roland was compelled to hand over three sons as hostages to Henry II, King of England in 1186. Roland and Helen had three sons, and two daughters. The name of one of Alan's brothers is unknown, suggesting that he died young. The other, Thomas, became Earl of Atholl by right of his wife. One of Alan's sisters, Ada, married Walter Bisset, Lord of Aboyne. The other, Dervorguilla, married Nicholas de Stuteville, Lord of Liddel. Alan's mother was the daughter of Richard de Morville, Anglo-Norman lord of Cunninghame and Lauderdale, and sister and heir of William de Morville, Lord of Lauderdale and Cunningham, Constable of Scotland. Alan's father was the eldest son of Uhtred, Lord of Galloway, son of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. The familial origins of Fergus are unknown, and he first appears on record in 1136. The mother of at least two of his children, Uhtred and Affraic, was an unknown daughter of Henry I, King of England. It was probably not long after Fergus' emergence into recorded history that he gave away Affraic in marriage to Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid, King of the Isles. One after-effect of these early twelfth-century marital alliances was that Alan\u2014Fergus' great-grandson\u2014was a blood relative of the early thirteenth-century kings of England and the kings of the Isles\u2014men who proved to be important players throughout Alan's career."
