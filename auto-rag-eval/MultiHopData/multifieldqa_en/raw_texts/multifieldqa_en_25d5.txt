Section 512 of the Copyright Law of the United States (17 U.S.C. Â§512) limits liability for copyright infringement by service providers if the service provider has designated an agent for notification of claimed infringement by providing contact information to the Copyright Office and through theservice provider's website.
Broadjam has designated an agent to receive notification of alleged copyright infringement (our agent is identified below). This Section 1.07 is without prejudice or admission as to the applicability of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C., Section 512, to Broadjam.
Upon receipt of a valid claim (i.e., a claim in which all required information is substantially provided) Broadjam will undertake to have the disputed Material removed from public view. We will also notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing Material that we have removed or disabled access to that Material. Broadjam has no other role to play either in prosecuting or defending claims of infringement, and cannot be held accountable in any case for damages, regardless of whether a claim of infringement is found to be true or false. Please note: If you materially misrepresent that Material infringes your copyright interests, you may be liable for damages (including court costs and attorneys fees) and could be subject to criminal prosecution for perjury.
Our designated agent will present your counter notification to the person who filed the infringement complaint. Once your counter notification has been delivered, Broadjam is allowed under the provisions of Section 512 to restore the removed Material in not less than ten or more than fourteen days, unless the complaining party serves notice of intent to obtain a court order restraining the restoration.
It is Broadjam's policy to terminate subscribers and account holders who are found to be repeat infringers.
Broadjam's designated agent is Elizabeth T Russell.

(d) That your Materials are original; that your Materials were either created solely by you or, by written assignment, you have acquired all worldwide intellectual property rights in and to your Materials; that if your Materials contain any "samples" or excerpts from copyrightable work the rights to which are owned in whole or in part by any person or entity other than you, that you have obtained and hold all rights, approvals, consents, licenses and/or permissions, in proper legal form, necessary to use and include such work in your Materials; and that your Materials do not otherwise infringe on the intellectual property rights of any person or entity.
(e) That neither your Materials nor any comments or reviews you post on the Site violate any common law or statutory patent, copyright, privacy, publicity, trademark or trade secret rights of any person or entity and are not libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise actionable at law or equity.

(i) All representations, warranties or covenants made herein by you shall survive termination of this Agreement.
(j) All warranties and representations made by you herein are made for the benefit of Broadjam and its sub-licensees and may be enforced separately by Broadjam and/or by any contractually designated sub-licensee of Broadjam.
In consideration of Broadjam's efforts to provide your work with public exposure, you expressly authorize Broadjam and its sub-licensees to transmit, stream, broadcast, publicly display and publicly perform in any manner, form or media whether now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, any ofthe Materials you submit to Broadjam, in accordance with the provisions of this section. Without limitation to other licenses you may be inferred to have granted in order to accomplish the foregoing, you expressly grant Broadjam and its sub-licensees the following worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable licenses with respect to any and all Materials you submit.
Public performance license for musical works. If you are a member of any collective rights management or performing rights society ("PRS"), worldwide, licensing and compensation for public performances of your Material consisting of musical works (including qualifying performances by Broadjam and any of its sub-licensees) shall be made solely by your PRS and pursuant to your affiliation agreement with your PRS. If you are not affiliated with a PRS, or if any performance by Broadjam or any of its sub-licensees does not qualify as a performance under your affiliation agreement with your PRS: you hereby grant Broadjam and its sub-licensees a nonexclusive, royalty-free, direct license to publicly perform all musical compositions included in your Materials, worldwide, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter devised.
Public performance license for sound recordings. If you are a member of SoundExchange or any other collective rights management organization for sound recordings ("CRMO"), worldwide, licensing and compensation for public performances of your Material consisting of sound recordings (including qualifying performances by Broadjam and any of its sub-licensees) shall be made solely by your CRMO and pursuant to your affiliation agreement with your CRMO.

Reproduction licenses for compositions and sound recordings. Although copyright law is evolving to accommodate the digital environment, certain key issues remain unresolved. One such issue is the extent to which reproduction licenses are required for musical works and sound recordings made available on interactive streaming services. We choose to resolve the issue contractually. Accordingly, you hereby grant Broadjam and its sub-licensees nonexclusive reproduction licenses for all musical works and sound recordings included in your Materials; provided, however, that unless by separate agreement you have chosen to make your Materials available for sale through Broadjam's digital download store, such reproduction licenses are limited in scope and apply only to the extent necessary to make your Materials publicly available via Broadjam's interactive streaming services. Podcasts. From time to time Broadjam may invite you to submit your Materials for inclusion in downloadable content files known as "podcasts." Podcasts are non-live entertainment programs spotlighting the work of Broadjam members and are made available for download in unprotected media, free of charge, at the Site. Broadjam will not include your Materials in podcasts without your consent. If you choose to grant such consent, however, you also (and hereby do) grant to Broadjam and its sub-licensees all licenses reasonably required for podcasting, including nonexclusive reproduction and public performance licenses for all musical works, and nonexclusive reproduction and public performance licenses for all sound recordings, embodied in any Materials of yours selected for inclusion in Broadjam podcasts. You further release Broadjam and its sub-licensees for any and all liability arising from any alleged failure by Broadjam or any of its sub-licensees to obtain appropriate licenses for the use of any Materials of yours selected for inclusion in Broadjam podcasts.
You may at any time opt to make Materials you have uploaded to Broadjam available to other Broadjam members free of charge ("Free Songs"). The Broadjam Free Songs feature is designed to help you further circulate your music. Your songs will not be designated as Free Songs without your express consent. Broadjam makes your Free Songs available for download in unprotected media, free of charge, in the Broadjam Downloads Store ("BDS"). If you choose to designate your songs as Free Songs, you expressly authorize Broadjam and its sub-licensees to reproduce, transmit, stream, broadcast, publicly display and publicly perform in any manner, form or media whether now known or hereafter devised, such Free Songs in accordance with the provisions of this section. You may at any time choose to change the status of a song from Free" to Not Free" and vice versa in your User Profile. Broadjam shall not make any payments to you for songs downloaded by Broadjam members during the time period in which you designated your songs as Free Songs. You further release Broadjam and its sub-licensees for any and all liability arising from any unauthorized exercise of copyright rights in connection with your Materials that you have chosen to designate as Free Songs.
Broadjam shall have the right and license to use, and license others to use, your Materials for the purpose of promoting our products and services, and to use all names, likenesses, biographical materials, logos, trademarks or trade names of you and all individuals performing on or otherwise represented in your Materials without any payment to you or any other Persons, entities, groups or associations, in accordance with the provisions of this section. All rights and licenses you grant to Broadjam pursuant to this section shall terminate, with respect to specific Materials, when, in accordance with this Agreement, you exercise your right to request removal of such Materials.
You represent and warrant that you have exclusive authority to grant all licenses that are granted to Broadjam and its sub-licensees in this Agreement. You understand that Broadjam is relying on this representation and warranty. You agree to and hereby do indemnify Broadjam, its licensees, assigns and customers against, and hold them harmless from, any loss, expense (including reasonable attorney fees and expenses), or damage occasioned by any claim, demand, suit, recovery, or settlement arising out of any breach or alleged breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants made herein or arising out of any failure by you to fulfill any of the representations, warranties, or covenants you have made herein.
Sub-licensees designated by Broadjam to transmit, stream, broadcast, publicly display and/or publicly perform your Materials may pay a fee to Broadjam for facilitating access to such Materials and you hereby agree that Broadjam shall be entitled to collect and retain 100% of all such facilitation fees without any obligation to you.
