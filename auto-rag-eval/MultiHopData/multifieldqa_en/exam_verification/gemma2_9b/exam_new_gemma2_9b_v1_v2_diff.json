      "This gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties. This shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks. Moreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task. We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language. We converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research. Related Work\n\nThe present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.

      "All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation. Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]\nAdequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk.",
      "Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain. The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.",
      "Vitamin K - Wikipedia\n(Redirected from Vitamin k)\nThis article needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources. Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015) This article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed]. Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2. Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2.",
      "It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. ^ \"Vitamin K Overview\".

      "§Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life is a prominent phenomenon in soils and sediment ecology resulting from anaerobic respiration. The microbial fuel cell mimics this ubiquitous natural phenomenon. Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants. In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. \"Revitalization\" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films. As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha.",
      "For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines. Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed. Since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories.",
      "The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially. The first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes."

      "And I am much more optimistic about that than Simon is. LIASSON: Roland, I wonder if we can interject you into this discussion a little bit. You have been a policymaker. What can be done to make sure that Simon's vision doesn't come true, and something a little closer to what Esther and Mitch describe does happen?\nHOMET: I think we probably need both doom seers and paradise seekers. We'll always have them, and we should have them. It's between the swing of those two views that things happen. I think that this notion of replacing the gatekeepers and letting everybody perform his own dance, to the amusement of those who chose to tune in, is one that many of us were promoting 20 years ago. That's not 1940 -- that's 1970 (laughter), and we were quite convinced that was likely to happen by the end of that decade. Now it's 12 years beyond the end of that decade, and we're nowhere near having that happening. We just have newly-named controversies, and so, as you heard me say in my little short remark, I think that our objective ought to be more modest, and that is to keep the questions open, not let them be foreclosed -- certainly not prematurely, and not on the basis of inadequate evidence. I would say something about the apocalyptic view, which is, I think there is a difference between information policy questions and welfare questions. The poor we have always with us, as somebody once said, and whether information, Cyberspace -- whatever you want to call it -- is promoted or not, that is true. It may become more glaringly true in an advanced information society, in which case, more may be done about it. So I wouldn't despair about that, and I wouldn't hold back on the development of instruments of interconnection simply because we can see that there is and will remain an underclass. Perhaps if we do the one, we'll be better equipped to do the other. LIASSON: In just a minute or two, we're going to open this up to your questions, but I want to try to end maybe with a discussion of something quite specific, which is, Who should own the new infrastructure and information systems?",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society."

      "Fundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state . With regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state . Electronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state. Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekulé triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.",
      "On-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell. We infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state. Concurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations. Finally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.\n. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. )."

I don't have to tell you how it ended. Mr. Ellsberg was one of 139 people arrested at that action. We've noted the protest in pretty much every snapshot since last Thursday. If something else comes out that's worth noting on the protest, we'll include it. We will not include people who don't have their facts and it's really sad when they link to, for example, Guardian articles and the links don't even back them up. It's real sad, for example, when they're trashing Hillary (big strong men that they are) and ripping her apart and yet Barack? \"Obama's inaccurate statements\"??? What the hell is that? You're inferring he lied, say so. Don't be such a little chicken s**t. It's especially embarrasing when you're grandstanding on 'truth.' Especially when you're the little s**t that clogged up the public e-mail account here in the summer of 2008 whining that you were holding Barack to a standard, then admitting that you weren't, then whining that if you did people would be mean to you. Oh, that's sooooooo sad. Someone might say something bad about you. The horror. You must suffer more than all the people in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. While the action took place in DC, actions also took place in other cities. We've already noted NYC's action this week, Doug Kaufmann (Party for Socialism & Liberation) reports on the Los Angeles action: Despite heavy rain, over 100 people gathered in Los Angeles on the corner of Hollywood and Highland to demand an end to the U.S. wars on Afghanistan and Iraq. People came from as far as Riverside to protest, braving what Southern California media outlets have dubbed the \"storm of the decade.\"",

Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that \"war is not the answer.\" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, \"How is the war economy working for you?\"While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N.

I'm sure al Maliki will have the same problems in his next four years as he had in the last four years.\" Days away from the ten months mark, Nouri managed to finally end the stalemate. Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by \"A good year in Iraq.\" First up, meet the new Iraqi Body Count -- an organization that provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it and insist/slur \"Things aren't so bad!\" Sure enough, the editorial board of the Post does just that noting the laughable \"civilian deaths\" count at iCasualities. As we noted -- long, long before we walked away from that crap ass website, they're not doing a civilian count. They're noting how many deaths Reuters reports."

      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999–2008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote.",
      "First period in cabinet (1996–1999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters. As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted. By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed.",
      "At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day. Post-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets. Political and social views\n\nEnglish is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law. In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\". In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. Opposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017.",
      "English described it as \"the worst day of my political life\". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support. By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest. Shadow cabinet roles and deputy leader\nOn 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education). In November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet. Fifth National Government (2008–2017)\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)"

One of the great under-appreciated aspects of BC sports is \"For Boston.\" However, the bloggers at Atlantic Coast Convos have great taste as they listed our fight song as the best in the ACC. (Am I the only one singing \"For Boston\" to himself right now?) BCeagles.com put out another player Q&A, this time with basketball transfer Alex Dragicevich. Dennis Clifford is one of the players who has made an early impression on Alex.\nLabels: Alex Dragicevich, BC Marching Band, For Boston, Myles Willis\nWey Q&A and other links\nBCeagles.com posted a Q & A with Patrick Wey. He talks about his summer training and trying to win another National Championship. BC basketball fans will enjoy this pic of the early '90s stars.

What's been frustrating is that White would be very, very good in some games and then off in others. Because he is playing primarily inside, the issues usually involve getting overpowered by bigger DTs. Like most of the olinemen the past few years, White's flashed moments of greatness but lacked consistency. What he needs to be: In my opinion the offensive line play really started falling apart after Matt Tennant left. I think Centers are underappreciated...at times even by their own coaches. It seems like the Spaz/Devine MO was to put the best five on the field regardless of positional fit and not to worry about rejiggering the lineup.",

HD is banking on our experience as a reason we could surprise people this year. BC keeps hitting Ohio prospects hard. The latest target is Cinci LB Marcus Oliver. Here is more on future Eagle Dan Monteroso. Monteroso also generated some interest from basketball schools. Maybe Spaz will let him play basketball in the Spring. This matrix took a different look at the Hot Seat issue. With regards to losing and underachieving, Spaz is not as bad as some of the bigger names on the list.

Labels: Carolyn Swords, Dan Monteroso, fire Spaz, HD, Hot Seat, Links, Marcus Oliver, Ryan Anderson\nNFL attendance problems a lesson for BC\nBC's faced some attendance issues the past few years. We like to blame the tailgating or Spaz or the schedule, but the reality is there are multiple factors. Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats. That would take up more space, eliminate seats and improve the watching experience. The internet has added fluidity to the ticket market. It used to be BC fans would buy season ticket packages to assure themselves Notre Dame tickets or some other desirable game.",
      "Chris Pantale is on the Mackey watch list. The award is given annually to the country's best Tight End. Beaver Country Day big man Jacquil Taylor is generating local interest. BC has yet to offer, but is following him. BCeagles.com posted a Q&A with Bobby Swiggert yesterday. I found his talk about paring down the offense encouraging. We need to work on execution not diversity of plays. HD put out this offseason filler piece ranking coaching jobs in the ACC. I don't really care where she perceives us. When the job changes we will be very attractive to the right guy for us. Labels: Bobby Swigert, Chris Pantale, emmett cleary, Heather Dinich, Kaleb Ramsey, Links, Recruiting, Truman Gutapfel\nWhere is the one that got away? While we've struggled recruiting Massachusetts players this year, we've cleaned up in Connecticut and in Ohio. Those local kids (or other lay-up recruits) we miss generate plenty of frustration but they happen every year. What's fortunate about our misses though, is that very few have come back to haunt us. When was the last time a great recruit spurned BC and became a star? I can think of a few over the years, but most of the recruits that \"got away\" had middling careers elsewhere. Some recent examples of guys who spurned us include Graham Stewart, Arthur Lynch and Joe Boisture. All three committed to BC at one point only to rethink their decisions and go to bigger programs. Stewart washed out at Florida and is now sitting out a transfer year at UConn. Boisture is out of football altogether. Lynch has been a backup at Georgia. He has a chance for a bigger role this season, but so far has not lived up to the hype that surrounded his recruitment. Even with our terrible offense, Chris Pantale has had a much more productive Tight End career. The closest thing I can think of to a recent recruit who had success elsewhere is Virginia OT Oday Aboushi. But should he even count? He didn't spurn BC. Our admissions office turned him down after he verbaled to BC. Prior to that, you would have to go back to Dorian Bryant.",
      "But I wonder if Spaz will have any hesitation in taking advantage of his alma mater. Virginia Athlete Atem Ntantang committed to BC. The ACC Digital Network is running a countdown of great moments. Of course they included BC comeback against Virginia Tech.

You can listen to Ramsey and Cleary here. I hoped that Spaz would address the Penn State situation. Knowing that those types of questions were coming, the ACC coaches released a joint statement on Penn State and Paterno. Someone should still ask Spaz on Monday since he does know Sandusky and played under Paterno. This is a shot of Kaleb Ramsey talking to the media. And here is all the players together. Cleary also fielded questions, including those about biology and chemistry. I expect more on Monday when Spaz talks.

      "Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference. Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully. At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line. At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line. Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction. After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side. Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape. Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs.",
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch.",
      "The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it. I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily. When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank."

      "The elevated ST segment is how this type of heart attack got its name. See also NSTEMI. Stent – An implantable device made of expandable, metal mesh (looks a bit like a tiny chicken wire tube) that is placed (by using a balloon catheter) at the site of a narrowing coronary artery during an angioplasty procedure. The stent is then expanded when the balloon fills, the balloon is removed, and the stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. TRIVIA ALERT: the coronary stent was named after Charles Stent (1807-1885), an English dentist who invented a compound to produce dentures and other things like skin grafts and hollow tubes (essentially what a metal coronary stent is). His real claim to fame occurred when he suggested using his material to coat underwater trans-Atlantic cable, which had broken several times as a result of corrosion by seawater. You’re welcome. Stint – a common spelling mistake when what you really mean is the word “stent” (see above). Stress Echocardiography – A standard echocardiogram test that’s performed while the person exercises on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. This test can be used to visualize the motion of the heart’s walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed, possibly revealing a lack of blood flow that isn’t always apparent on other heart tests. The echocardiogram is performed just before and just after the exercise part of the procedure. See also TTE. Sudden Cardiac Arrest – The stopping of the heartbeat, usually because of interference with the electrical signal (often associated with coronary heart disease). Can lead to Sudden Cardiac Death. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy – A heart condition that can mimic a heart attack. Sometimes called Broken Heart Syndrome, it is not a heart attack, but it feels just like one, with common symptoms like severe chest pain and shortness of breath. It sometimes follows a severe emotional stress. Over 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75. Also referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome.",
      "See also: MIBI, Echocardiogram, Nuclear Stress Test. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) – A genetic predisposition to dangerously high cholesterol levels. FH is an inherited disorder that can lead to aggressive and premature cardiovascular disease, including problems like heart attacks, strokes, or narrowing of the heart valves. Femoral Artery: a major artery in your groin/upper thigh area, through which a thin catheter is inserted, eventually making its way into the heart during angioplasty to implant a stent; currently the most widely used angioplasty approach in the United States, but many other countries now prefer the Radial Artery access in the wrist. FFR – Fractional Flow Reserve: A test used during coronary catheterization (angiogram) to measure pressure differences across a coronary artery stenosis (narrowing or blockage) defined as as the pressure behind a blockage relative to the pressure before the blockage. HC – High Cholesterol: When fatty deposits build up in your coronary arteries. HCTZ – Hydrochlorothiazide: A drug used to lower blood pressure; it acts by inhibiting the kidneys’ ability to retain water. Used to be called “water pills”. Heart Failure – a chronic progressive condition that affects the pumping power of your heart muscle. Sometimes called Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Holter Monitor – A portable monitoring device that patients wear for recording heartbeats over a period of 24 hours or more. HTN – Hypertension: High blood pressure, the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries as it flows through them. Hypokinesia – Decreased heart wall motion during each heartbeat, associated with cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or heart attack. Hypokinesia can involve small areas of the heart (segmental) or entire sections of heart muscle (global). Also called hypokinesis. ICD – Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator: A surgically implanted electronic device to treat life-threatening heartbeat irregularities. IHD – Ischemic Heart Disease: heart problems caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries, causing a decreased blood supply to the heart muscle.",
      "Symptoms include leg pain when walking (called intermittent claudication). PAF – Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation that lasts from a few seconds to days, then stops on its own. See also Atrial Fibrillation. Palpitations – A noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat due to agitation, exertion or illness. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation – An unusual heart arrhythmia of unknown origin, at one time believed to be associated with an unusual sensitivity to alcohol consumption. PDA – patent ductus arteriosus: A persistent opening between two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The opening is called ductus arteriosus and is a normal part of a baby’s circulatory system before birth that usually closes shortly after birth. But when it remains open, it’s called a patent ductus arteriosus. If it’s small, it may never need treatment, but a large PDA left untreated can allow poorly oxygenated blood to flow in the wrong direction, weakening the heart muscle and causing heart failure or other complications. Pericardium: two thin layers of a sac-like tissue that surround the heart, hold it in place and help it work. PET – Positron Emission Tomography: A non-invasive scanning technique that uses small amounts of radioactive positrons (positively charged particles) to visualize body function and metabolism. In cardiology, PET scans are used to evaluate heart muscle function in patients with coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy. PFO – Patent Forman Ovale: An opening between the left and right atria (the upper chambers) of the heart. Everyone has a PFO before birth, but in 1 out of every 3 or 4 people, the opening does not close naturally as it should after birth. Plaque – A deposit of fatty (and other) substances in the inner lining of the artery wall; it is characteristic of atherosclerosis. POTS – Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: A disorder that causes an increased heart rate when a person stands upright.\nPPCM – Post-partum cardiomyopathy: A form of cardiomyopathy that causes heart failure toward the end of pregnancy or in the months after delivery, in the absence of any other cause of heart failure.",

INR – International Normalized Ratio: A laboratory test measure of blood coagulation, often used as a standard for monitoring the effects of the anti-coagulant drug, warfarin (coumadin). IST – Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: A heart condition seen most often in young women, in which a person’s resting heart rate is abnormally high (greater than 100 bpm), their heart rate increases rapidly with minimal exertion, and this rapid heart rate is accompanied by symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, and/or exercise intolerance. Interventional cardiologist – A cardiologist who is trained to perform invasive heart procedures like angiography, angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), implanting stents, etc. IVS – Interventricular Septum: The stout wall that separates the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart from one another. IVUS – Intravascular Ultrasound: A form of echocardiography performed during cardiac catheterization in which a transducer (a device that can act as a transmitter (sender) and receiver of ultrasound information) is threaded into the heart blood vessels via a catheter; it’s used to provide detailed information about the blockage inside the blood vessels. LAD – Left Anterior Descending coronary artery: One of the heart’s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle. LAFB – Left Anterior Fascicular Block: A cardiac condition,distinguished from Left Bundle Branch Block because only the anterior half of the left bundle branch is defective and more common than left posterior fascicular block. LAHB – Left Anterior Hemiblock: The Left Bundle Branch divides into two major branches – the anterior and the posterior fascicles. Occasionally, a block can occur in one of these fascicles. Left Circumflex Artery – The artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body; it’s a branch of the Left Main Coronary Artery after the latter runs its course in between the aorta and the Main Pulmonary Artery. Left Main Coronary Artery – The artery that branches from the aorta to supply oxygenated blood to the heart via the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) and the Left Circumflex Artery.",
      "TAVR – Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A minimally invasive procedure to repair a damaged or diseased aortic valve. A catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded to the heart. A balloon at the end of the catheter, with a replacement valve folded around it, delivers the new valve to take the place of the old. Also called TAVI (Transcatheter aortic valve implantation). Tetralogy of Fallot – A rare condition caused by a combination of four heart defects that are present at birth, affecting the structure of the heart and causing oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and into the rest of the body. Infants and children with Tetralogy of Fallot usually have blue-tinged skin because their blood doesn’t carry enough oxygen. Often diagnosed in infancy, but sometimes not until later in life depending on severity. Tg – Triglycerides: The most common fatty substance found in the blood; normally stored as an energy source in fat tissue. High triglyceride levels may thicken the blood and make a person more susceptible to clot formation. High triglyceride levels tend to accompany high cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity. TIA – Transient Ischemic Attack: A stroke-like event that lasts only for a short time and is caused by a temporarily blocked blood vessel. TEE – Transesophageal echocardiogram: This test involves an ultrasound transducer inserted down the throat into the esophagus in order to take clear images of the heart structures without the interference of the lungs and chest. Treadmill Stress Test – See Exercise Stress Test. troponin – a type of cardiac enzyme found in heart muscle, and released into the blood when there is damage to the heart (for example, during a heart attack). A positive blood test that shows elevated troponin is the preferred test for a suspected heart attack because it is more specific for heart injury than other blood tests, especially the newer high sensitivity troponin tests (hs-cTnT). TTE – Transthoracic Echocardiogram: This is the standard echocardiogram, a painless test similar to X-ray, but without the radiation, using a hand-held device called a transducer placed on the chest to transmit high frequency sound waves (ultrasound)."

      "Absorption and dietary need[edit]\nPrevious theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]\nThe National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 μg and 120 μg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 μg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2–2.5 μg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV).",
      "Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.\nOsteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\nFunction in animals[edit]\nMechanism of action of vitamin K1. The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \"Gla protein\". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below. Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase.",

The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]\nPhylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone. A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain.",

Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed]. Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2. Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2."

      "The temperature behaviour of ${\\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \\cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \\cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,\n the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n     \n     \\section{Conclusions}\n     \\label{sec:conc}\n\n\nDifferent statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model. After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.",
      "In Ref. \\cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\\sigma = \\pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature. In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv \\left(\\cos \\phi,\\sin \\phi\\right)$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi ) $. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \\cite{Potts52} where the phase $\\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \\pi$ interval, $\\phi_a =  a 2 \\pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}. Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. In particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. This paper is organized as follows: in Sec.",
      "The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \\cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods. The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \\eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \\ref{sec:model}. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the  reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber \\cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b, Popoff10a,Akbulut11,Popoff11,Yilmaz13,Riboli14}."

First Norwegian offshore field\nEkofisk began production on 15 June 1971, following its discovery in the autumn of 1969. Development of the field has occurred in several phases. Its central facilities were installed during the early 1970s, with oil initially being buoy-loaded into tankers. From 1975, it has been piped to Teesside in the UK.

However, declining pressure in the Ekofisk reservoir over the years has caused the seabed to subside.

In addition, a protective breakwater was installed around the Ekofisk tank in 1989. The rate of seabed subsidence has declined sharply in recent years. Waterflooding improves recovery\nThe Ekofisk 2/4 K water injection platform became operational in December 1987 as part of efforts to improve Ekofisk’s recovery factor – the share of petroleum in place actually produced. Waterflooding capacity on the field to help maintain reservoir pressure was later expanded several times, and had reached just over 500 000 barrels per day by 2019.

His Eminence inherited the skill in the issuing of Fatawa (Legal Islamic Rulings) and in tackling the complex issues relating to Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) directly from Mufti-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) who inherited it directly from Mujaddid-e-Deen-o-Millat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Bareilvi (rahmatullahi alaih). He is not only the Successor and a trustworthy custodian of Fatawa writing of Shaikh Mufti-e-Azam Hind (rahmatullahi alaih), but also the custodian of learning, knowledge, sanctity and saintliness, of his grandfather, Hujjatul Islam, Moulana Muhammad Haamid Raza Khan (rahmatullahi alaihi). His father, Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Raza Khan Jilaani Mia (rahmatullahi alaih), was a great Aalim and Saint. He was well-versed in the commentary of the Holy Quran and so was given the title of Mufassir-e-Azam-e-Hind or Great Commentator of the Holy Quran in India. His Eminence, Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari, travels extensively propagating the Deen and is a world-renowned preacher and a spiritual guide.",
      "Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was born on Monday, 22nd of Zil Hijjah 1310 AH (18 July 1892) in the most beautiful city of Bareilly Shareef, India. It was in this very city that his illustrious father, the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam, Imam-e-Ahle Sunnat, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu) was born (1856 - 1921). At the time of the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu), his distinguished father, was in Mahrerah Shareef, one of the great spiritual centers of the Sunni World. On that very night, Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) dreamt that he had been blessed with a son and in his dream he named his son \"Aale Rahmaan\". Hazrat Makhdoom Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu), one of the great personalities of Mahrerah Shareef, named the child \"Abul Barkaat Muhiy'yuddeen Jilani\". Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was later named \"Mustapha Raza Khan\". His Aqiqa was done on the name of \"Muhammad\", which was the tradition of the family. Upon the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) Sayyiduna Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) told A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), \"Maulana! When I come to Bareilly Shareef, then I will definitely see this child. He is a very blessed child. \"\nAs promised, when Sayyiduna Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) went to Bareilly Shareef, he immediately summoned to see Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) who was only six (6) months old. Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu), as he was also famously known, congratulated A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) and said, \"This child will be of great assistance to the Deen and through him the servants of Almighty Allah will gain great benefit. This child is a Wali. From his blessed sight thousands of stray Muslims will become firm on the Deen. He is a sea of blessings. \"\nOn saying this, Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu) placed his blessed finger into the mouth of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and made him a Mureed.",
      "Those present just gazed at each others faces and remained silent. Only later did they realise what Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was implying. Hazrat was spiritally present for Jummah at the Nau Mahla Masjid! Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only giving hope to the Mureedeen but also informing them of his Wisaal. The shining star of A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), the glitter and the hope for the hearts of millions throughout the world, the Mujaddid of the 15th Century, the Imam of his time, Huzoor Sayyidi Sarkaar Mufti-e- Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) left the Aalame Duniya to Journey towards the Aalame Aakhira. It was 1.40 p.m. on the eve of the 14th of Muharram 1402 AH (1981). \"Chal diye tum Aankho me ashko ka darya chor kar, har jigar me dard apna meetha meetha chor kar\"\nRawa Aankho se he Ashko ke Dhaare Mufti-e-Azam, Kaha Ho Be Saharo Ka Sahara Mufti-e-Azam\"\nOn Friday, the 15th of Muharram, at 8. 00 a.m. the Ghusl of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) took place. His nephew, Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) performed the Wudhu. Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari performed the Ghusl. Sultan Ashraf Sahib used the jug to pour water. The following persons were present during the Ghusl : Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan, Sayed Mustaaq Ali, Maulana Sayed Muhammad Husain, Sayed Chaif Sahib, Maulana Naeemullah Khan Sahib Qibla, Maulana Abdul Hamid Palmer Razvi, Muhammad Esa of Mauritius, Ali Husain Sahib, Hajji Abdul Ghaffar, Qari Amaanat Rasool Sahib and a few other Mureeds and family members. Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari and Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) have stated that at the time of the Ghusl Shareef of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) the Chaadar mistakenly moved a little. Immediately, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) held the Chaadar between his two fingers and covered the area that the Chaadar exposed.",
      "He also blessed him with I'jaazat and Khilafat at the same time. (Mufti Azam Hind Number, pg. 341). Not only did he receive Khilafat in the Qaderi Silsila (Order), but also in the Chishti, Nakshbandi, Suharwardi, and Madaari Orders. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) also received Khilafat from his blessed father, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu). Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) attained most of his early education from his illustrious family - from his father, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu) the Mujaddid of Islam, whose status and position even at that time cannot be explained in these few lines. He also studied Kitaabs under the guidance of Hazrat Moulana Haamid Raza Khan (his elder brother), Maulana Shah Rahm Ilahi Maglori and Maulana Sayed Basheer Ahmad Aligarhi and Maulana Zahurul Hussain Rampuri (radi Allahu anhum). He studied various branches of knowledge under the guidance of his most learned and blessed father, A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). He gained proficiency in the many branches of Islamic knowledge from among which are: Tafseer; Hadith; Fiqh; Laws of Jurisprudence; Sarf; Nahw; Tajweed; Conduct of Language; Philosophy; Logistics; Mathematics; History etc.; Arithmetic; Aqaid (Belief); Taasawwaf; Poetry; Debating; Sciences; etc. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu's) brilliance as an Islamic Scholar manifested itself when he was a still a youth, but overflowing with knowledge and wisdom. He wrote his first historical Fatawa (Islamic Ruling) when he was only 13 years old. It dealt with the topic of \"Raza'at\" - affinity between persons breast fed by the same woman. The following has been recorded with regards to this occasion. Hazrat Maulana Zafrud'deen and Hazrat Maulana Sayed Abdur Rasheed (radi Allahu anhum) were at the Darul Ifta (Fatawa Department) at this stage. One day, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) walked into the Darul Ifta and noticed that Hazrat Maulana Zafrud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) was writing a certain Fatawa."

      "FIG. 2 shows an illustrative example of a system that may be used to generate supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) based on additional information provided by a plurality of users in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, system 200 may be used to generate supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) on a display (e.g., display 108 (FIG. 1)) of a user device (e.g., user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4)). It should be noted that in some embodiments, the devices shown in FIG. 2 may correspond to one or more devices in FIGS. 3-4.\nFIG. 2 shows system 200. In system 200, a user is currently accessing a media asset on display 202. In some embodiments, display 202 may correspond to display 100 (FIG. 1)). During an event (e.g., event 106 (FIG. 1)) a user may have requested supplemental information about an event (e.g., event 106 (FIG. 1)) in display 202 using user device 204. Media application 206, which in some embodiments, may be implemented on user device 204 or at a remote location (e.g., supplemental information source 418 (FIG. 4)), receives the request for supplemental information. Media application 206 determines the context of the event (e.g., who said the statement making up the event and to what the statement was referring). After determining the context of the statement, the media application may itemize into one or more tasks, additional information (e.g., facts) it requires in order to generate the supplemental information (e.g., a verification or correction of the factual basis of the statement). For example, if the event is a statement about the amount of coal that is exported from the United States (e.g., as described in relation to FIG. 1 above), media application 206 may determine the fact required to generate the supplemental information is the exact numerical amount of coal that is exported from the United States. The media application may then transmit requests for the additional information (e.g., a request for the exact numerical amount of coal that is exported from the United States) to a plurality of other users.",
      "In some embodiments, an indicator that supplemental information has previously been generated or is currently ready to generate (e.g., a plurality of users are available) may be displayed to a user (e.g., on display 100 (FIG. 1) during the event). The indicator may also indicate the particular information, the multimedia format, and/or the form of supplemental information that is available. An indicator may also appear with the supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)), which allows the user to request additional supplemental information or provide feedback/responses (e.g., rating the quality of the supplemental information) to the media application and/or plurality of users. In some embodiments, a user may also access (e.g., via selection of an indicator and/or automatically upon the supplemental information being generated) summary information about the event. For example, in some embodiments (e.g., when the supplemental information is not generated in real-time), the media asset may have progressed to a different point by the time the supplemental information is ready for display. Therefore, the media application may need to provide a video clip of the event or other summary information, so that the user remembers about what or why the supplemental information was requested. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. It should be noted that the components shown in FIG. 3 may be used to store, receive, transmit, and/or display the media assets, additional information, and/or supplemental information as described herein. For example, media application 206 (FIG. 2) may be implemented on user equipment device 300, and may issue instructions (e.g., displaying supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) via control circuitry 304. Users may access media assets and the media application (and its display screens described above and below) from one or more of their user equipment devices.",
      "In some embodiments, the length of the portion may depend on a user profile for the user or for anyone of the plurality of users. For example, a user profile and/or a content recognition file (e.g., data structure 500 (FIG. 5)) may indicate that a particular user may require more or less additional content. For example, the user may be aware of particular characters or plot points in the media asset and, therefore, may not require the additional content to introduce those aspects. In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive a particular user interface, which organizes the data about the event (e.g., a clip of the actual event, summary information about the event, information about the request for supplemental information issued by the user, etc.). The interface may also include an automatic submission form, which may be used to generate a message, which is sent to the media application. In some embodiments, the media application may also receive user input from the user requesting the supplemental information that further affects the generation of supplemental information by the media application. For example, the user may request the supplemental information includes particular information (e.g., the factual basis of a statement), may request a multimedia format of the supplemental information (e.g., textual description, a video clip, etc.), may request a form of the supplemental information (e.g., a short description about the event, an Internet link to other sources of information on the event, or a true or false designation about the event) by entering user inputs (e.g., via user input interface 310 (FIG. 3)). It should be noted that any information or process referred to in this disclosure that is referred to as being in response to a user input may alternatively and/or additionally be performed automatically by the media application (e.g., via control circuitry 304 (FIG. 3)). For example, in some embodiments, a user may request a true or false designation (e.g., an on-screen pop-up box indicating whether an event was true or false). Additionally and/or alternatively, in some embodiments, the true or false designation may appear automatically based on predetermined settings indicating to the media application to display a true or false designation in response to detecting an event.",
      "As used herein, the “context” of an event refers to the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event that influence or affect the meaning of the event. For example, when determining the context of a written and/or spoken statement, the media application may determine who or what authored/stated the statement, the written and/or spoken words and/or other statements that preceded and/or followed the statement, the tone of the statement, and/or any other conditions that may alter the connotation of the statement. FIG. 1 shows an illustrative example of a media application that may be used to display supplemental information in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Display 100 illustrates a display on a user device displaying a media asset. Display 108 illustrates a display featuring supplemental information as described and/or generated in FIGS. 6-9. It should be noted that display 100 and display 108 may be presented on any of the devices shown in FIGS. 3-4. For example, in some embodiments, display 100 and display 108 may be displayed on user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4). In FIG. 1, display 100 represents a display of a media asset (e.g., a streaming television program) on a user device (e.g., user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4)). Display 100 includes entity 102 and entity 104. In display 100, entity 104 is currently speaking as indicated by event 106. As shown in FIG. 1, event 106 is a statement (e.g., “We export a lot of coal”) by a person in the media asset. In some embodiments, display 108 represents the continued display of the media asset on a user device, after a user has requested supplemental information about event 106. For example, a media application may have received a user input (e.g., via user input interface 310 (FIG. 3)) while entity 104 was speaking. Using the systems and methods described herein (e.g., FIGS. 6-9), the media application generated supplemental information 110.

      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.",
      "Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God. Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice. Characters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible. Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression. Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi. Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II). Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting).",
      "Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father. Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school. For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population. Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods. One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition. Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau.",
      "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement. Plot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty. One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed."

      "\\section{Introduction}\nThe Schwarzschild solution plays a key role in teaching about general relativity: It describes the simplest version of a black hole. By Birkhoff's theorem, it more generally describes the gravitational field around any spherical mass distribution, such as the Sun in our own Solar system. As one of two particularly simple, yet physically relevant examples of a non-trivial metric (the other being the FLRW spacetime of an expanding universe), it is particularly well-suited for teaching about general techniques of ``reading'' and interpreting a spacetime metric. Consider undergraduate courses where students are introduced to selected concepts and results from general relativity without exposing them to the full mathematical formalism. Such courses have the advantage of introducing students to one of the two great fundamental theories of 20th century physics early on (the other being quantum mechanics); they also profit from subject matter that meets with considerable interest from students.\\cite{Hartle2006} Using the terminology of Christensen and Moore,\\cite{Christensen2012} in the ``calculus only'' approach pioneered by Taylor and Wheeler,\\cite{Taylor2001,Taylor2018} spacetime metrics are not derived, but taken as given, and the focus is on learning how to interpret a given spacetime metric. Similar presentations can be found in the first part of the ``physics first'' approach exemplified by Hartle's text book,\\cite{Hartle2003} where the concepts of the metric and of geodesics are introduced early on, and their physical consequences explored, while the mathematics necessary for the Einstein equations is only introduced at a later stage. Whenever the approach involves an exploration of simple metrics such as the Schwarzschild solution, but stops short of the formalism required for the full tensorial form of Einstein's equations, access to a simple derivation of the Schwarzschild solution that does not make use of the advanced formalism can be a considerable advantage.",
      "Simplified derivations of the Schwarzschild solution have a long tradition within general relativity education,\\cite{Schiff1960,Harwit1973} although specific simplifications have met with criticism.\\cite{Rindler1968} This article presents a derivation which requires no deeper knowledge of the formalism of differential geometry beyond an understanding of how to interpret a given spacetime metric $\\mathrm{d} s^2$. The derivation avoids the criticism levelled at attempts to derive the Schwarzschild solution from the Einstein equivalence principle in combination with a Newtonian limit,\\cite{Gruber1988} relying as it does on a simplified version of the vacuum Einstein equation. More specifically, I combine the restrictions imposed by the symmetry with the simple form of Einstein's equations formulated by Baez and Bunn.\\cite{BaezBunn2005} That same strategy was followed by Kassner in 2017,\\cite{Kassner2017} but in this text, I use the ``infalling coordinates'' that are commonly associated with the Gullstrand-Painlev\\'e form of the Schwarzschild metric,\\cite{Martel2001,Visser2005,HamiltonLisle2008} not the more common Schwarzschild coordinates. That choice simplifies the argument even further. In the end, what is required is no more than the solution of an ordinary differential equation for a single function, which yields to standard methods, to obtain the desired result. \\section{Coordinates adapted to spherical symmetry and staticity}\n\\label{SymmetriesCoordinates} Assume that the spacetime we are interested in is spherically symmetric and static. In general relativity, a symmetry amounts to the possibility of being able to choose coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry, at least within a restricted sub-region of the spacetime in question. That the spacetime is static is taken to mean that we can introduce a (non-unique) time coordinate ${t}$ so that our description of spacetime geometry does not depend explicitly on ${t}$, and that space and time are completely separate --- in the coordinates adapted to the symmetry, there are no ``mixed terms'' involving $\\mathrm{d} {t}$ times the differential of a space coordinate in the metric.",
      "Note that equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) also holds true in Newtonian gravity. So in a way, this version of Einstein's equation can be seen as a second-order extension of the usual Einstein equivalence principle: Ordinarily, the equivalence principle is a statement about physics in the absence of tidal forces. Equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) adds to this that the lowest-order correction for tidal forces in a freely falling reference frame is that specified by Newtonian gravity. This makes sense, since by going into a free-fall frame, and restricting our attention to a small spacetime region, we have automatically created a weak-gravity situation. In such a situation, tidal corrections are approximately the same as those described by Newton. This argument can serve as a heuristic justification of (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}). In 2017, Kassner made use of the Baez-Bunn form of Einstein's vacuum equation to derive the Schwarzschild solution, starting from what we have encountered as the static form of the metric (\\ref{StaticForm}).\\cite{Kassner2017} We follow the same general recipe, but using the infalling coordinates introduced in section \\ref{Sec:InfallingObservers}, which makes our derivation even simpler. Consider five test particles in a small region of space. Let the motion of each be the same as for the local representative from our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers. We take the central particle $C$ to be at radial coordinate value $r=R$ at the time of the snapshot shown in Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}. The other four are offset relative to the central particle: As described in the local inertial system that is co-moving with the central particle, one of the particles is shifted by $\\Delta l$ upwards in the radial direction, another downward, while two of the particles are offset orthogonally by the same distance. \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{01-free-fall-particles.pdf}\n\\caption{Five test particles in our spherically-symmetric spacetime}\n\\label{TestParticlesOutside}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe $\\Delta l$ is meant to be infinitesimally small, so while Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside} is of course showing a rather large $\\Delta l$ so as to display the geometry of the situation more clearly, we will in the following only keep terms linear in $\\Delta l$. \n\nConsider a generic particle, which moves as if it were part of our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers, and which at the time $T_0$ is at $r=r_0$. By a Taylor expansion, that particle's subsequent movement is given by\n\\begin{equation}\nr(T)",
      "Our derivation does not require knowledge of advanced mathematical concepts beyond the ability to properly interpret a given metric line element $\\mathrm{d} s^2$. Even our analysis of tidal effects proceeds via a simple second-order Taylor expansion, leading to differential equations for $\\beta(r)$ that are readily solved using two applications of the method of separation of variables. What is new about the derivation presented here is the combination of the Baez-Bunn equations with the infalling coordinates typical for the Gullstrand-Painlev\\'e form of the metric --- this combination is what, in the end, makes our derivation particularly simple. In turn, this simplicity is what should make the derivation particularly useful in the context of teaching general relativity in an undergraduate setting. The derivation proceeds close to the physics, and gives ample opportunity to discuss interesting properties of Einstein's theory of gravity. Students who are presented with this derivation, either as a demonstration or as a (guided) exercise, will come to understand the way that symmetries determine the form of a metric, the deductions that can be made from Einstein's equivalence principle, and last but not least that we need to go beyond the equivalence principle, and consider tidal forces, to completely define our solution. \\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nI would like to thank Thomas M\\\"uller for helpful comments on an earlier version of this text.",
      "\\section{$\\beta(r)$ from tidal deformations}\n\\label{TidalSection}\n\nIn the previous section, we had exploited symmetries and Einstein's equivalence principle. In order to determine $\\beta(r)$, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the {\\em vacuum Einstein equations}. More specifically, we use a particularly simple and intuitive form of the vacuum Einstein equations, which can be found in a seminal article by Baez and Bunn:\\cite{BaezBunn2005} Consider a locally flat free-fall system around a specific event $\\cal E$, with a time coordinate $\\tau$, local proper time, where the event we are studying corresponds to $\\tau=0$. In that system, describe a small sphere of freely floating test particles, which we shall call a {\\em test ball}. The particles need to be at rest relative to each other at $\\tau=0$. Let the volume of the test ball be $V(\\tau)$. Then the vacuum version of Einstein's equations states that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}\\right|_{\\tau=0} = 0.\n\\label{EinsteinVacuum}\n\\end{equation}\nIn words: If there is no matter or energy inside, the volume of such a test ball remains constant in the first order (those were our initial conditions) and the second order (by eq.~[\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}]). If you are familiar with Wheeler's brief summary of Einstein's equations, ``spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move'' and ``mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve'',\\cite{Wheeler1990} you will immediately recognise that this is a specific way for the structure of spacetime telling the test ball particles how to move. The calculation later in this section provides the second part: It will amount to using (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) to determine the structure of spacetime, namely the still missing function $\\beta(r)$, and that is the way for mass, in this case: for the absence of mass, to tell spacetime how to curve."

      "Since the strong coupling regime does not have a well defined lattice spacing, we also determine the baryon mass am B to set the parameters of the grand-canonical partition function, aT and aµ B , in units of am B . We conclude by discussing the resulting nuclear interactions, and compare our findings with other results. Staggered action of strong coupling QCD and its dual representation\n\nIn the strong coupling regime, the gauge integration is performed first, followed by the Grassmann integration to obtain a dual formulation. This was pioneered for the strong coupling limit in and has been extended by one of us to include gauge corrections . The sign problem is mild in the strong coupling limit and still under control for β < 1, where we can apply sign reweighting. The dual degrees of freedom are color-singlet mesons and baryons, which are point-like in the strong coupling limit, and become extended about a lattice spacing by incorporating leading order gauge corrections. The partition function of lattice QCD is given by where DU is the Haar measure, U ∈ SU(3) are the gauge fields on the lattice links (x, μ) and { χx , χ x } are the unrooted staggered fermions at the lattice sites x. The gauge action S G [U] is given by the Wilson plaquette action and the staggered fermion action S F [ χ, χ, U] is: where the gauge action depends on the inverse gauge coupling β = 2Nc g 2 and the fermion action depends on the quark chemical potential aµ q which favors quarks in the positive temporal direction, and the bare quark mass am q . First we consider the strong coupling limit where the inverse gauge coupling β=0 and hence the gauge action S G [U] drops out from the partition function in this limit. The gauge integration is over terms depending only on the individual links (x, μ) so the partition function factorizes into a product of one-link integrals and we can write it as:\nwith z(x, μ) the one-link gauge integral that can be eval-uated from invariant integration, as discussed in , where we write the one-link integral in terms of new hadronic variables: Only terms of the form (M (x)M (y))",
      "However, at finite baryon density, lattice QCD has the infamous sign problem which does not allow us to perform direct Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice. Various methods have been proposed to overcome the numerical sign problem, but they are either limited to µ B /T 3 or can not yet address full QCD in 3+1 dimensions in the whole µ B − T plane , in particular the nuclear transition is out of reach. An alternative method is to study lattice QCD via the strong coupling expansion. There are two established effective theories for lattice QCD based on this: (1) the 3-dim. effective theory for Wilson fermions in terms of Polyakov loops, arising from a joint strong coupling and hopping parameter expansion , the dual representation for staggered fermions in 3+1 dimensions, with dual degrees of freedom describing mesons and baryons. Both effective theories have their limitations: is limited to rather heavy quarks (but is valid for large values of β) whereas ( ) is limited to the strong coupling regime β 1 (but is valid for any quark mass). We study lattice QCD in the dual formulation, both at infinite bare gauge coupling, β = 0, and at leading order of the strong coupling expansion in the regime β < 1, which is far from the continuum limit. But since strong coupling lattice QCD shares important features with QCD, such as confinement, and chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at the chiral transition temperature, and a nuclear liquid gas transition, we may get insights into the mechanisms, in particular as the dual variables give more information in terms of its world lines, as compared to the usual fermion determinant that depends on the gauge variables. To establish a region of overlap of both effective theories, we have chosen to perform the Monte Carlo simulations in the dual formulation extending to rather large quark masses. This paper is organized as follows: in the first part we explain the dual formulation in the strong coupling regime, in the second part we provide analytic results based on exact enumeration and mean field theory, in the third part we explain the setup of our Monte Carlo simulations and present result on the m q -and β-dependence of the nuclear transition.",
      "Strong Coupling\n\nWithout any further resummation, there is a mild sign problem in the dual formulation of lattice QCD in the strong coupling limit. When the average sign σ is not too small (close to zero), it implies that most of the configurations have a positive weight thus allowing us to perform sign reweighting strategies. In Fig. , ∆f is plotted as a function of the baryon chemical potential and the quark masses. It is seen that ∆f is close to zero for most cases except near the critical chemical potential and for small quark masses, but never exceeds 5 × 10 −4 . Hence sign reweighting can be performed in the full parameter space. The result that the sign problem becomes even milder when increasing the mass is related to the fact that larger critical chemical potentials result in a larger fraction of static baryons (spatial baryon hoppings become rare). FIG. . ∆F at strong coupling as a function of chemical potential and quark mass on a 6 3 × 8. The sign problem becomes milder as the quark mass increases. Finite β\n\nAll runs at finite β have been obtained for N τ = 4, which corresponds to a moderately low temperature aT = 0.25 compared to the value of the chiral transition aT 1.54. Those simulations were too expensive to attempt N τ = 8 runs, in particular as a higher statistics was required. The spatial volumes are 4 3 , 6 3 and 8 3 . For β values are from 0.0 to 1.0 with step size 0.1, and for am q values from 0.00 to 1.00 with step size 0.01. The values of aµ were chosen close to the nuclear transition, the scanning range is shifted to large values as am q increases. At small quark masses the scanning range is from aµ = 0.4 to 1.0 and for the large quark masses, it is from 0.6 to 1.2 with step size 0.01. The statistics used for are 15 × 10 4 measurements and between measurement, 40 × N 3 s worm updates. Residual sign problem\n\nAlthough it is possible to resum the sign problem at strong coupling with a resummation of baryon and pion world lines, this is not possible when including gauge corrections.",

Nuclear interaction scaled with baryon mass. As the quark mass increases, it tends to zero. FIG. 18. Critical baryon chemical potential and baryon mass from different approaches. Parameters for the Monte Carlo runs to determine the nuclear transition at strong coupling, with statistics after thermalization. abstract\n\nThe nuclear liquid-gas transition from a gas of hadrons to a nuclear phase cannot be determined numerically from conventional lattice QCD due to the severe sign problem at large values of the baryon chemical potential. In the strong coupling regime of lattice QCD with staggered quarks, the dual formulation is suitable to address the nuclear liquid gas transition. We determine this first order transition at low temperatures and as a function of the quark mass and the inverse gauge coupling β. We also determine the baryon mass and discuss the nuclear interactions as a function of the quark mass, and compare to mean field results. It is known from experiments that at low temperatures, there is a phase transition between dilute hadron gas and dense nuclear matter as the baryon chemical potential increases. This transition is of first order and terminates at about T c = 16 MeV in a critical end point. The value of the chemical potential µ 1st B at zero temperature is given roughly by the baryon mass m B , where the difference of µ 1st B −m B is due to nuclear interactions. For a review on nuclear interactions see . As the nuclear force between baryons to form nuclear matter is due to the residual strong interactions between quarks and gluons, it should be accurately described by QCD. We choose to study the nuclear transition and nuclear interaction via lattice QCD , with its Lagrangian being a function of the quark mass and the inverse gauge coupling. In order to understand the nature of the transition, it is helpful to study its dependence on these parameters.",
      "We find that as the quark mass becomes large, spatial mesons hoppings (i.e.\nspatial dimers) become rare, which makes this 3+1-dimensional system closer to 1dim. QCD . Also, both the baryon mass and the baryon chemical potential obtained in our dual representation, i.e. for staggered fermions, approaches the baryon mass of the 3-dim. effective theory which is based on Wilson fermions. Another comparison that summarizes the validity of the mean field approach discussed in Section II B is shown in Fig. . It is evident that mean field theory has strong deviations for small quark masses, but this discrepancy becomes smaller for larger quark masses. The extension of the study of the nuclear transition to finite inverse gauge coupling β is summarized in Fig. , which shows the β-dependence of aµ c B for various quark masses. For all quark masses ranging from am q = 0 to am q = 1.0, there is only a very weak β-dependence, confirming the expectation from mean field theory . This works was restricted to isotropic lattices ξ = a/a t = 1, i.e. we performed simulations at fixed temperature. Non-isotropic lattices are necessary to vary the temperature at fixed values of β. This requires to include two bare anisotropies, γ for the fermionic action and γ G for the gauge action. Finite β has only been studied by us in the chiral limit . Clearly, it is interesting to study the location of the nuclear critical point also including higher order gauge corrections and at finite quark mass. Simulations including O(β 2 ) are under preparation."

Thanks to Stephanie Taber for writing this letter below, which may or may not run in the Chico News and Review:\nI’d like to take this opportunity to respond to Quentin Colgan’s letter of July 12th; primarily because the costs surrounding the Special Election held regarding Measure A have been distorted. Yes, it did cost $150,000, but why? That’s the elephant in the room. The progressives on the City Council chose the method by which the election would be held. Per the City Charter (which is the City’s Constitution) Section 501 clearly states “The City Council may determine that any Special Election shall be held by mailed ballot” etc. That would have cut the cost by half, at least. But the Council chose the most expensive means possible, voting at the precinct. They were afraid that just telling the students they were being disenfranchised, which was an obvious lie, would not be sufficient to defeat it. As to “it’s all the Tea Party’s fault”; I was the only signature to the Measure. I felt no need to consult the Tea Party before I took that action; but did enlist the help of many concerned citizens to gather the more than 8,000 signature required to put it on the ballot.

The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don’t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous — still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don’t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn’t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California. Eventually necessity will force desalination past the environmentalists, but not yet. pasojim says:\t09/13/2010 at 7:46 am\nWhatisup – On one of your previous post you made the comment you haven’t heard any of the legal suggestions for the water issue, But you obviously have.",
      "It’s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it’s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use”. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn’t give our City Council a “BLANK CHECK” for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a “special tax” or “an assessment” be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes. As it is now, a” fee” on a capital funding project is not deductible."

While our elected leaders frolic and cavort in their stupid committee meetings, the Chamber is working on a “Top 10 Economic Development Action List”. Yeah, sounds great, until you consider, one of their “Top 10” is a proposal to raise the local sales tax. One prominent member of the Chamber who might be able to fill us in on the discussion is Bob Evans. I’ve asked Bob where he stands on this tax increase, but he just keeps saying he hasn’t seen a proposal yet. Lately I have asked him if he would require Lando and the other sales tax increase proponents to get the legal number of signatures on a petition before he votes to put this proposal on the ballot, but he won’t answer me. His downright refusal to discuss the tax increase is frustrating to me – I want to believe Bob is a “fiscal conservative.” After all, he had some high and mighty things to say about his opposition to the phone tax.

Read it and weep – and then call them to ask what they did with that property tax check you just sent in.

FlightGlobal- Boeing sitting on 8 unsold C-17s\nBy: Dan ParsonsWashington DCSource: Flightglobal.com\nThis story is sourced from Flightglobal.com 12 hours agoBoeing has sold two more C-17 transports to an undisclosed customer, but it will likely end the year with eight unsold white tails. There are 10 Boeing C-17 airlifters in various stages of assembly at the company’s Long Beach, California, production facility. Two of the aircraft are spoken for by an unnamed customer, Boeing says. Boeing is trying to sell off the other eight white tails, which will be the last produced before the factory is shuttered sometime in the summer of 2015. The 279th – and final – C-17 fuselage will be mated to its wings in January or February, programme spokeswoman Tiffany Pitts tells Flightglobal. The operation is California’s last remaining aircraft production line and the lone widebody military aircraft production line in the USA, according to Boeing. At least two countries – Australia and Canada – have publicly announced an intention to purchase a C-17, though neither factor into Boeing’s future planning, Pitts says. Until contracts are finalised, the number available remains eight, she says. The Royal Canadian Air Force already has four C-17As, according to Flightglobal’s World Air Forces 2014 directory. Canadian news outlets reported earlier in December that the air force would buy one C-17 with money left over at the end of 2015.",
      "X-Posting from FGFA thread. Despite Putin’s visit, two pacts on military aircraft still in doldrums\nPresident Vladimir Putin may have come and gone but stalemate largely persists over two key long-pending India-Russian defence projects, the fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) and military multirole transport aircraft (MTA). The deadlock over the MTA, which were initially envisaged to gradually replace IAF's ageing fleet of the medium-lift AN-32 aircraft, seems to be much more serious. India now wants to ascertain the cost viability of the twin-engine transport aircraft in comparison to similar planes available in the market. There are also questions about the MTA's \"predicted timelines for delivery\" as well as its failure to meet the high-altitude requirements, which need to be answered before India even thinks of inking the full-scale contract for the project, said sources.

Ultimately, the best bet is going to come form the 787's that take a fewer people (so you can do the longer routes) with still a competitive CASM, and the B and F class folks will pay good money for newer aircraft. Postby Kartik » 04 Dec 2014 12:55\nLets see if there is any forward movement on the stalled MTA project once Putin arrives in New Delhi\nMajor defence deals to be signed during Putin-Modi summit\nIn this connection, it is expected that during the summit, Russia and India may ultimately resolve several long-delayed agreements on military-technical cooperation projects between the two countries and sign them finally for their implementation. These agreements, above all, include joint Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project and joint development of Multi-role Transport Aircraft (MTA). A final deal on FGFA for production has been delayed because the Indian Air Force (IAF) did not approve the design and work-share. Now Russia has reportedly agreed that the jet would be a two-seat design, not a one-seater. India’s work-share would also be increased from18 percent to 25 percent, and even up to 40-50 percent in the near future, in view of the steady development of the Indian aviation industry. Defence and SecurityAccording to the agreement, India’s stealth air-to-air missile “Astra” along with Indo-Russian BrahMos supersonic cruise missile will be mounted on the FGFA. The preliminary design agreement on FGFA had been signed in 2010 between Indian HAL and Russian Sukhoi Design Bureau to build the jet for the use by both countries. The final design contract was to be signed in July-August 2012. But the deadline has already passed. According to the Indian media reports, under the programme, India is expected to build 200 fighter jets at the cost of $30 billion. FGFA is not the only Indo-Russia joint project. The two countries also signed an agreement on the joint development of MTA in 2007, based on Il-214 Russian plane.",
      "Of the eight foreign aviation majors that got the global tender, American Boeing and Lockheed-Martin as well as Brazilian Embraer said they did not manufacture the class of aircraft being sought by IAF. Refusing to take part in the tender, Russian Rosoboronexport said it wanted a fresh design and development project. Antonov of Ukraine wanted yet another extension of the bid submission deadline due to the ongoing conflict in Crimea. Swedish Saab said it had shut down its assembly line for such aircraft. Then, Alenia Aermacchi was linked to Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, which has been slapped with \"a partial ban\" after the infamous VVIP helicopter scandal. \"All this left only the European consortium Airbus. The DAC will have to take a call since re-tendering may lead to the same situation,\" said the source. Incidentally, it was the Modi government's first DAC in July -- then headed by Arun Jaitley - which revived the Avro replacement project after it was put on hold by the UPA-2 regime last year due to strong opposition from the powerful PSU lobby and ministers like Praful Patel, as reported by TOI earlier. Apart from the critical need to encourage the private sector to enter defence production in a big way, especially in the aerospace arena where Hindustan Aeronautics enjoys a monopoly, its felt the defence PSU's order books are already overflowing with projects. Fingers crossed. Hopefully sense will prevail. Why was lr got? Er is capable of Dubai to sfo nonstop. Lr is overkill unless we want Delhi to Peru . Singha wrote: Why was lr got? Er is capable of Dubai to sfo nonstop. they wanted it for non-stop routes from India to the west coast of the US. But with fuel prices going higher and with the lower seat count on the 777-200LR, the seat mile costs grew too high. A 3 class configuration only made matters worse. A higher density configuration with more economy class seats and just 12-15 Business class seats would have been better perhaps, especially if they didn't have very high First Class load factors."

      "Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives. In 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis. Early life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961. She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead. She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class. She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964. Legal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time."

      "Usually I run out of time before I get here, so I have plenty of room to grow in this area. As I reflect on my process I realize that it’s uniquely tailored to me. My background as a writer, my love for theology, and my unique skills all lead me to emphasize different things. For someone with a different background and skill set this might be like trying on another man’s armor. How can you leverage who you are to preach better? Of course, I didn’t do this from scratch; I was given a great model in seminary and have observed some great preachers thanks to modern technology. The key for me is molding this process to fit my unique mix of strengths and weaknesses, and that’s sure to be a never-ending project. Annual Meeting in Review: ETS 2015\nNovember 22, 2015 Josh Vajda\t2 Comments\nLast week I made my usual pilgrimage to the place where all the evangelical seminary geeks converge: the Annual Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society. This year was the second time Atlanta has hosted since I began attending, and it was fun reliving early autumn just before the snow arrived back home. Over the years I developed a strategy: make plans to attend nonstop papers, then throw out those plans when relational opportunities arise. This year the program was a bit light, but thankfully the people made up for what was lacking. When reflecting on the meeting I was reminded of just how good last year’s meeting had been. This year had none of the same “aha!” moments, but I did enjoy many rich times of reflection after various papers. As is my usual habit, I attended a number of friend’s papers (e.g., Ford on Ignatius, Roeber on historiography, Svigel on the Didache). But then I also stalked a few of the theologians I’ve come to admire in recent years: Al Mohler, Carl Trueman, and Anthony Bradley. Of course the problem there is that once you begin following someone you have the ever-increasing experience of anticipating what they are going to say on a given subject. This is especially true of Mohler, whose two podcasts have been my intellectual lifeline this year in times when babies and house projects and service commitments have prevented deeper study.",
      "If an idea gets me really excited, I’ll jump out of my seat and pretend I’m preaching on it right then and there. Often those bursts of inspiration have gems worth polishing. Hopefully by the end of the exegetical process and the theological Q&A, I have a list of ideas and phrases to sprinkle in as I actually write the sermon. One unfair advantage here is I took a course in copy writing, which is basically script for advertising. I especially liked what my professor called “fulcrum phrases,” like M&M’s famous “melts in your mouth / not in your hand.” It’s a skill I’ve tried to hone in my songwriting. If you can find that well-crafted phrase that has symmetry, it connects deeper and sticks better. I try to make sure I find at least one for every sermon. Here are some I’ve used:\nIt’s not yours to take; it’s God’s to give. He who walks in humility walks in grace. The fruit of your life reveals the tree of your heart. You don’t have to hold on to anything for God to hold on to you. So that’s my ideal, but I’m looking for anything at all that excites me, because if I’m excited about something there’s a good chance someone else will be, too. Sermon Structure At this point, I’m ready to start writing my sermon. I know what the text is about, why it exists, how it relates to the rest of Scripture, which parts are difficult to understand, and which parts are exciting. But before I can build content, I need a skeleton. At Dallas Seminary I learned that a good introduction has the same essential parts, and I use the acronym INSTeP to remember them: image, need, subject, text, and preview. As someone with some creative writing background, I didn’t like this at first. But truth be told, a good sermon borrows from both storytelling and essay. The story draws you in, but the essay keeps you grounded. And just like a good essay, you need a thesis statement and its essential supports to help prepare people for what’s to come. In my mind, the most important aspect of the introduction is the boring stuff: what’s the subject, what problem does it solve, where is our passage, and what are the main points.",
      "Analytic Theology\nWhat came as an outright disappointment was the afternoon I spent in the Analytic Theology section. For those of you who don’t know, “analytic theology” is a recent movement to apply the tools of analytic philosophy to the questions of theology. I’ve been thrilled about this from the moment I heard of it, but what I saw really didn’t reflect what I think the movement is capable of. The thinking seemed lackluster and the questions unhelpful. Crisp and especially Rae were there asking insightful questions, but I think being overly kind to the presenters. I suppose you can’t be too inhospitable if you want guests to come back next year. Avoiding the Marriage-and-Family Theme\nThe theme this year was “Marriage and Family” but it’s clear the real interest was continued discussion of how to deal with LGBT-related doctrines. In the past year I’ve read numerous books, taught two classes, and delivered a regional paper on the subject. That was enough for me. Maybe there were some missed opportunities here, but I’m ok with that. Reflection on 2015\nOne of the things I’ve been forced to do each year—and rightly so, I think—is to reevaluate my purpose and progress in the intellectual community. This occupied much of my reflection in private, some with friends, and significant portions of the drive time from Michigan. Here are a few conclusions I reached:\nEven though I can’t justify a doctorate for my career, I am coming to the conviction that I can justify one for ministry. It may even be something I must do. Even though I have the tools for self-study, I can accomplish much more with a cohort of like-minded individuals. I need to find a group of theologians I can run with or I will fall behind. Even though I feel as though I’ve hardly studied this past year, (I recall reading only two theology books!), I’m reminded that I’ve still accomplished quite a bit with my LGBT studies, weekly Sunday School prep, church doctrinal formulations, and ministry strategizing. It’s different work, but I haven’t been as lazy as I feared.",
      "This post was adapted from our sermon series on Interpreting Exodus. Pastor Megan preached this sermon at Butner Federal Prison complex on August 30, 2015. On Father’s Day 2015, we gathered for worship at the labyrinth in front of UNC hospital, having devoted the month of June to exploring the question, “What happens after we die?” Many have watched their father’s die in this place or other similar spaces. We shared in a time of both remembrance and prayer/meditation, participating in the ancient spiritual practice of walking the labyrinth. A labyrinth is a kind of maze, laid out in a circle. Tony graciously shared the following reflections from his experience at the labyrinth on the hot June day. It’s smaller than I expected, stark and hard‐surfaced, with no landscaping for ornamentation or shade. I don’t know what to expect from it… or from myself. But that’s part of the appeal. I stand at the entrance, hesitating, trying to clear my mind. This doesn’t work very well, so I just start walking. Almost immediately, the path presents itself as a linear and chronological symbol of my life’s journey. Like my physical lifetime, it has a beginning and an end, with an as‐yet undetermined amount between. This could be interesting. I like it so far… although I’m insecure about my style… and unsure about proper protocol. Is someone staring at me? Do I have to meditate? How slowly should I walk? Is it better to focus my thoughts… or to simply let them come? Will I control this thing, or allow it to control me? I begin to see each step as an increment of elapsed time, an irretrievable expenditure of life energy. I equate my initial discomfort to the natural immaturity of my childhood years. I gradually move beyond it, into metaphorical adulthood. This is much better. Most of the path is a series of gentle arcs. These are fairly easy to maneuver, like my comfortable life. But these segments are connected by intermittent sharp turns, mostly 180‐degree switchbacks. I see these as representing significant life changes or challenges, requiring more concentration and skill to negotiate."

      "I was so shocked. Wasn’t expecting that. She gave me a GNT (nitroglycerin) spray in case I do get pain and take 75Mg of aspirin. I’m now waiting for a Cardiology referral. I am so stressed and consumed by what might be wrong. My maternal grandmother had angina and valve issues. Her 3 brothers all had double bypasses. Could I have inherited this? I am not overweight at 63kg and 5.ft 9. I walk 20-25 miles a week at work and general walking here and there. I started HRT (patches evorol 25 -50) in July as menopause pain was making me feel like I was 90 and was getting me down. I am worried so much now and analysing every ache/ twinge I get. I feel like a hypochondriac at the moment. I’m worried what will happen at the cardiologist and what the test will entail and tell me. I am waiting on cholesterol test which I had on 25/01/19. Can I have inverted T waves and be fine. Please help I am so scared and crying far too much. Hello Colleen – the first thing is: please take a big deep breath before you read another word here! I’m not a physician so of course cannot comment on your specific case, but I can tell you generally that the definition of “angina” (as this glossary lists above) is “distressing symptoms”, typically chest pain that gets worse with exertion, and goes away with rest. That’s classic stable angina… typically caused by something that’s reducing blood flow to the heart muscle (causing the chest pain of angina). A family history that might make a difference for you personally is only in what’s called your ‘first degree’ relatives: for example, if your mother or sister were diagnosed with heart disease before age 65, or if your Dad or brother were diagnosed before age 55, then doctors would consider that you have a family history as a risk factor for heart disease. There’s little if any scientific evidence that a grandparent or uncle’s heart disease history has any effect on your own risk. It is a very good thing that you’re having further tests and a referral to a cardiologist, if only to ease your mind.",
      "There are many reasons for inverted T-waves, ranging from cardiac issues to completely benign conditions. One way of looking at this is choosing to believe that seeing a cardiologist will ease your mind one way or the other – so this is something to look forward to, not dread. If the cardiologist spots something suspicious, a treatment plan will be created. If not, you can wave goodbye and go back to happily living your life. Try thinking of this cardiology appointment just as you would if your car were making some frightening noises and you were bringing it to your mechanic for a check up. You could work yourself into a complete state worrying ahead of time if the car trouble is going to be serious, or you could look at this appointment as the solution – at last! – to figuring out what’s wrong so the mechanic can recommend the next step. Thank you for this list of so many definitions provided in plain English. what a valuable resource this is. THANK YOU, I have been looking for translations FOR PATIENTS not med school graduates– like this for three years. My family doctor had me wear a 24 hr EKG. After reading the results, she has scheduled a scope to look inside my heart by a specialist. Completely forgoing a stress test. Said I have major changes in the EKG, what type of changes could they be looking at? Had LAD STENT INSERTED 7 YRS AGO – WHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR? This is a great wealth of information, Carolyn! I looked and did not see my diagnosis, which is aortic stenosis. I looked under aortic as well as stenosis. Did I just miss it somehow? I learned some new information, I am a bit familiar now, but not when I had my MI, it was like learning a new language. But, my favorite part was seeing SCAD on this list! Thank you.\nThanks and welcome! I was thinking of editing that SCAD definition actually: I suspect that that it isn’t so much that SCAD is “rare”, but it’s more that it’s “rarely correctly diagnosed”. I totally agree that SCAD is not as rare as I believed for many years. Once awareness is spread to all medical staff, I believe many lives will be saved.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations.",
      "Leading up to this I had been battling anxiety and depression which my husband found very hard to cope with. Over the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage. Please Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future. Thank you for listening and your site. I have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate. I did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she’s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn’t want to come home (the next day after school). By this stage, I also had enough and didn’t go get her. I thought I am not begging. You will run out of money soon. It was quite a relief to have some peace. Daughter’s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it). I didn’t really want this but made a compromise that daughter would go there Tues morning – Friday afternoon as the friend is an A student whereas my daughter is failing. They do the same subjects. I made the decision at the end of the day based on what is good for me – some time away from the daughter.",
      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling."

      "Nevertheless, the best layer of macaque IT appears in the last part of networks, where the feature map has been downsampled more times. In summary, our results might reveal two distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice. First, there is a distinct functional hierarchical structure of macaque ventral visual pathway, while there might be no clear sequential functional hierarchy in mouse visual cortex. One explanation is that the mouse visual cortex is organized into a parallel structure and the function of mouse cortical regions are more generalized and homogeneous than those of macaques. Another possibility would be that even though the sequential relations exist among mouse cortical regions as proposed in anatomical and physiological work, they are too weak for the current deep neural networks to capture. Additionally, mice perform more complex visual tasks than expected with a limited brain capacity . Consequently, the neural responses of mouse visual cortex may contain more information not related to object recognition that neural networks focus on. Secondly, it is well known that the units in the neural networks get larger receptive fields after downsampling, and through the analyses of differences between two groups of models based on depth, we find the feature map of the best layer for mouse is downsampled fewer times than that for macaque. Based on these results, we provide computational evidence that the increased ratio of the receptive field size in cortical regions across the mouse visual pathway is smaller than those across the macaque visual pathways, which echoes some physio- Macaque-Face dataset --- Table : The correlation between the similarity scores and the number of parameters. r is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. \"-\" indicates that there is no significant correlation. To explore the processing mechanisms in the visual cortex of macaques and mice, we investigate the model properties from the whole to the details. As shown in Table and 2, we first measure the correlation between the similarity scores and the sizes (i.e. the number of trainable parameters and the depth) of network models.",
      "Depths of the layers with the highest similarity scores exhibit little differences across mouse cortical regions, but vary significantly across macaque regions, suggesting that the visual processing structure of mice is more regionally homogeneous than that of macaques. Besides, the multi-branch structures observed in some top mouse brain-like neural networks provide computational evidence of parallel processing streams in mice, and the different performance in fitting macaque neural representations under different stimuli exhibits the functional specialization of information processing in macaques. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. Originally, the prototype of deep neural networks is inspired by the biological vision system . To date, deep neural networks not only occupy an unassailable position in the field of computer vision , but also become better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . They have been successful at predicting the neural responses in primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of ventral visual stream (Güc ¸lü and van Gerven 2015; , and even controlling neural activity . Moreover, as training paradigms of mice and techniques for collecting neural activity (de Vries et al. 2020) have been greatly improved, there is a strong interest in exploring mouse visual cortex. Deep neural networks also play an important role in revealing the functional mechanisms and structures of mouse visual cortex . Compared to biological networks, Artificial Neural Networks discard the complexity of neurons . Spiking Neural Networks, incorporating the concept of time and spikes, are more biologically plausible models . To be more specific, because of their capabilities of encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features, deep SNNs are highly possible to yield brain-like representations ).",
      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background.",
      "To figure out the distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice, for each cortical region, we obtain the normalized depth of the layer that achieves the highest similarity score in each model. Then, we divide models (excluding vision transformers) into two groups based on their depths and conduct investigations on these two groups separately. A nonparametric ANOVA is applied to each group for testing whether layer depths change significantly across cortical regions. For mouse visual cortex (Figure (a)), taking the deep model group as an example, ANOVA shows overall significant changes in depth across cortical regions for TSVD-Reg and RSA (Friedman's χ 2 = 49.169,\np = 2.0 × 10 −9 ; χ 2 = 19.455, p = 0.002). But there is no significant change for SVCCA (χ 2 = 8.689, p = 0.122). According to these results, the differences in depth across regions are indeterminacy and irregular. Meanwhile, the trends of layer depth between some regions contradict the hierarchy observed in physiological experiments of mice (those between VISp and VISrl for TSVD-Reg and between VISal and VISpm for RSA). However, for macaque visual cortex (Figure (b)), there are significant differences (t = −5.451, p = 6.5 × 10 −6 ; t = −8.312, p = 2.8 × 10 −9 ; t = −3.782, p = 6.9 × 10 −4 , also taking the deep model group as an example) between V4 and IT, and the trend is consistent with the information processing hierarchy in primate visual cortex. The comparative analyses of the best layer depths of the shallow and deep model groups also exhibit the differences between macaques and mice. For mouse visual cortex, the best layer depths of shallow models are significantly higher than those of deep models. Compared to deep models, most shallow models achieve the top similarity scores in intermediate and even later layers. Differently, for macaque visual cortex, the depth of models has little effect on the depth of the most similar layer. What's more, we find that the most similar layer of mouse visual cortex always occurs after the 28 × 28 feature map is downsampled to 14 × 14, which leads to the layer depths' difference between shallow and deep models."

      "Additionally, we propose a probabilistic version, which captures predictive uncertainties and further improves upon the results of the deterministic framework. INTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-fidelity simulations of critical phenomena such as ocean dynamics and epidemics have become essential for decision-making. They are based on physically-motivated PDEs expressing system dynamics that span multiple spatiotemporal scales and which necessitate cumbersome computations . In recent years there is increased attention to the development of data-driven models that can accelerate the solution of these PDEs as well as reveal salient, lower-dimensional features that control the long-term evolution. In most cases, data-driven reduced-order models are not interpretable. In particular, models based on neural networks despite good predictive capabilities , they offer a black-box description of the system dynamics. A possible remedy is applying a symbolic regression to the learned neural network representation , but this adds additional computational cost due to the two-step procedure. A number of frameworks such as SINDy allows to learn interpretable dynamics but it relies on the a-priori availability of lower-dimensional descriptors and of time-derivatives which can be very noisy for both simulation and experimental data. Other frameworks are tailored to specific problems such as molecular dynamics . Here, we present a framework that only needs the value of the observables, and not their derivatives, as training data and is capable of identifying interpretable latent dynamics. The deployment of interpretable latent dynamics ensures that conservation of important properties of that are reflected in the reduced-order model . The present method is related to approaches based on the Koopman-operator extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) but uses continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the latent space dynamics. Therefore we do not have to enforce any parametrizations on the Koopman matrix .",
      "The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis . This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II. Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation. We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n ∈ R f with n = 1, ..., T .",
      "All phase-spaces were obtained by using a finite-difference operator on the data or predictions. These results are in accordance Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation with whose LSTM-based temporal dynamic model was also able to find the correct phase space but not to track the actual dynamics for long-term predictions. Our model is not able to account for noise in the temporal evolution and thus dealing with chaotic, small-scale fluctuations is challenging. We believe that a probabilistic version of our algorithm could be advantageous here. This section contains a fully probabilistic formulation for the deterministic model discussed before. We replace the Autoencoder with a Variational Autoencoder and the ODE in the latent space with a SDE. The loss function which we optimize is the Evidence-Lower Bound (ELBO). Model Structure We postulate the following relations for our probabilistic model using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for each dimension i of the latent space and a Wiener process W t in the latent space: We again assume that the latent variables z t are complex-valued and a priori independent. Complex variables were chosen as their evolution includes a harmonic components which are observed in many physical systems. We assume an initial conditions z 0,i ∼ CN (0, σ 2 0,i ). The total parameters associated with the latent space dynamics of our model are thus {σ 2 0,i , σ 2 i , λ i } c i=1 and will be denoted by θ together with all parameters responsible for the decoder mapping G (see next section). These parameters along with the state variables z t have to be inferred from the data x t . Based on probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) , we set σ 2 i = 2; (λ j ) and σ 2 0,i = 1. As a consequence, a priori, the latent dynamics are stationary. A derivation and reasoning for this choice can be found in Appendix A. Hence the only independent parameters are the λ i , the imaginary part of which can account for periodic effects in the latent dynamics. Variational Autoencoder\n\nWe employ a variational autoencoder to account for a probabilistic mappings from the lower-dimensional representation z n to the high-dimensional system x n ."

      "Addiction risk for people taking high doses of oxycodone begins climbing after just three days, a recent study concluded.

They were getting an average of nine months worth of pills, state officials said. Pill mill doctors prescribed 1 million of those pills:\nDoctors working for the George twins’ trafficking empire prescribed at least 102,081 oxycodone pills billed to Medicaid before the ring collapsed in 2010. Working out of a Delray Beach pain clinic founded by a convicted drug smuggler, Zvi Harry Perper, son of the Broward County medical examiner, was arrested on trafficking charges, but not before he wrote prescriptions to Medicaid patients for 115,977 doses of oxycodone in 90 days. In Lake Worth, Cesar Deleon was arrestedas part of a DEA pill mill sweep and charged with 55 counts of illegally distributing drugs. Deleon wrote orders for 20,302 oxycodone pills for Medicaid patients. Miami internist Dr. Selwyn Carrington authorized 32,411 doses of oxycodone for Medicaid patients in just two years. He was busted for signing his name to hundreds of prescriptions. Further, Florida wasn’t in any hurry to stop doctors linked to pill mills. Carrington was arrested for overprescribing in March 2011. The state’s emergency order to suspend his license was signed months after he had pleaded guilty in 2012. Perper was busted at a Delray Beach pill mill operated by a former felon in 2011. The state did not act against his license until 2014. Joseph M. Hernandez was writing prescriptions from his car, a veritable pill mill on wheels, when he was busted in February 2010 on one count of trafficking in oxycodone. .Florida’s Department of Health didn’t file paperwork to restrict his license for almost 18 months.

Answer: “The Oxy Express Explained”\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country’s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation’s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country’s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn’t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn’t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders.",

He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills.

      "They are all helpful to characterize the TNE strength and describe the TNE behaviors of a fluid system from their perspectives. But it is not enough only relying on these quantities. Besides the above physical quantities describing the TNE behaviors, in DBM modeling, we can also use the non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) to characterize the TNE state and extract TNE information from the fluid system. Fundamentally, four TNE quantities can be defined in a firstorder DBM, i.e., ∆ σ * 2 , ∆ σ * 3,1 , ∆ σ * 3 , and ∆ σ * 4,2 . Their definitions can be seen in Table , where v * i = v i − u represents the central velocity and u is the macro flow velocity of the mixture. Physically, ∆ σ * 2 = ∆ σ * 2,αβ e α e β and ∆ σ * 3,1 = ∆ σ * 3,1 e α represent the viscous stress tensor (or non-organized momentum flux, NOMF) and heat flux tensor (or non-organized energy flux, NOEF), respectively. The e α (e β ) is the unit vector in the α (β ) direction. The later two higher-order TNE quantities contain more condensed information.

(ii) The physical meaning of D * m,n is the TNE strength of this perspective.

(iii) Checking the TNE state and extracting TNE information. (iv) The selection/design of the boundary conditions. Simplification and modification of the Boltzmann equation\n\nAs we know, the collision term in the original Boltzmann contains high dimensional distribution functions. Therefore, the direct solution to it needs too much computing consumption. The most common method to simplify the collision operator is to introduce a local equilibrium distribution function ( f eq ) and write the complex collision operator in a linearized form, i.e., the original BGK collision operator − 1 τ ( f − f eq ), where τ is the relaxation time . The original BGK operator describes the situation where the system is always in the quasi-equilibrium state. Namely, it characterizes only the situation where the Kn number of the system is small enough and f ≈ f eq . The currently used BGK operator for non-equilibrium flows in the field is a modified version incorporating the meanfield theory description .

      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI."

The shaded area represents the estimated uncertainty for each prediction, i.e. $\\hat{\\mu}_k\\pm2\\hat{\\sigma}_k$. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD). \\hbox{Table \\ref{tab:table_MSD}} shows this steady-state MSD of the estimate of the MISO channel with different methods. As can be seen, the best tracking performance is obtained by standard LMS and the proposed method. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Opened Extensions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\n{We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios. Moreover, it has fewer free parameters than previous approaches and these parameters have a clear physical meaning. Finally, as stated in the introduction, one of the advantages of having a probabilistic model is that it is easily extensible:}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item If, instead of using an isotropic Gaussian distribution in the approximation, we used a Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix, we would obtain a similar algorithm with different step sizes and measures of uncertainty, for each component of ${\\bf w}_k$. Although this model can be more descriptive, it needs more parameters to be tuned, and the parallelism with LMS vanishes. \\item Similarly, if we substitute the transition model of \\eqref{eq:trans_eq} by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, \n\n\\begin{equation}\np({\\bf w}_k|{\\bf w}_{k-1})= \\mathcal{N}({\\bf w}_k;\\lambda {\\bf w}_{k-1}, \\sigma_d^2), \\nonumber\n\\label{eq:trans_eq_lambda}\n\\end{equation}\na similar algorithm is obtained but with a forgetting factor $\\lambda$ multiplying ${\\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}$ in \\eqref{eq:lms}.",
      "In this work, we provide a similar connection between state-space models and least-mean-squares (LMS). Our approach is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. Similar approaches have already been developed for a variety of problems such as channel equalization using recurrent RBF neural networks \\cite{cid1994recurrent}, or Bayesian forecasting \\cite{harrison1999bayesian}. Here, we show the usefulness of this probabilistic approach for adaptive filtering. The probabilistic perspective we adopt throughout this work presents two main advantages. Firstly, a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size emerges naturally with this approach, making it suitable for both stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size \\cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}, and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard LMS. Secondly, the use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications. Experiments with simulated and real data show the advantages of the presented approach with respect to previous works. However, we remark that the main contribution of this paper is that it opens the door to introduce more Bayesian machine learning techniques, such as variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods \\cite{barber2012bayesian}, to adaptive filtering.\\\\\n\n\n\\section{Probabilistic Model}\n\nThroughout this work, we assume the observation model to be linear-Gaussian with the following distribution,\n\n\\begin{equation}\np(y_k|{\\bf w}_k) = \\mathcal{N}(y_k;{\\bf x}_k^T {\\bf w}_k , \\sigma_n^2),\n\\label{eq:mess_eq}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere  $\\sigma_n^2$ is the variance of the observation noise, ${\\bf x}_k$ is the regression vector and ${\\bf w}_k$ is the parameter vector to be sequentially estimated, both $M$-dimensional column vectors.",
      "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nProbabilistic models have proven to be very useful in a lot of applications in signal processing where signal estimation is needed \\cite{rabiner1989tutorial,arulampalam2002tutorial,ji2008bayesian}. Some of their advantages are that 1) they force the designer to specify all the assumptions of the model, 2) they provide a clear separation between the model and the algorithm used to solve it, and 3) they usually provide some measure of uncertainty about the estimation. On the other hand, adaptive filtering is a standard approach in estimation problems when the input is received as a stream of data that is potentially non-stationary. This approach is widely understood and applied to several problems such as echo cancellation \\cite{gilloire1992adaptive}, noise cancellation \\cite{nelson1991active}, and channel equalization \\cite{falconer2002frequency}. Although these two approaches share some underlying relations, there are very few connections in the literature. The first important attempt in the signal processing community to relate these two fields was the connection between a linear Gaussian state-space model (i.e. Kalman filter) and the RLS filter, by Sayed and Kailath \\cite{sayed1994state} and then by Haykin \\emph{et al.} \\cite{haykin1997adaptive}. The RLS adaptive filtering algorithm emerges naturally when one defines a particular state-space model (SSM) and then performs exact inference in that model. This approach was later exploited in \\cite{van2012kernel} to design a kernel RLS algorithm based on Gaussian processes. A first attempt to approximate the LMS filter from a probabilistic perspective was presented in \\cite{park2014probabilistic}, focusing on a kernel-based implementation. The algorithm of \\cite{park2014probabilistic} makes use of a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate as an approximation for the predictive step. However, this approximation does not preserve the estimate of the uncertainty in each step, therefore degrading the performance of the algorithm."

      "She has just turned 14 last week, and was diagnosed with Asperger's/ Autism Spectrum Disorder 15 months ago. I have already been seeing a child psychologist for the past five months, however the methods she has been advising have not been very effective. Our main difficulty with our daughter is her overwhelming obsession to use her cell phone (and to a lesser extent her laptop) constantly. Without any restriction, she will be on it every minute of the day, and will be awake until the early hours every day. We have tried to incorporate her input around rules as to when she has to give in her phone, but she is unwilling to compromise on a time that she should give it to us, believing that she should have unlimited use. I believe she is unable to do any adequate study or homework, as she is constantly having to look at the phone. We have tried to put rules in place that she has to give in her phone and laptop on school nights at 22:15. If she is able to do this then she is given rewards, and if she doesn't then she knows that there will be consequences. The consequence has been restricted use the following day. However, this is usually where we fail, because taking her phone away from her results in tantrums, screaming, and even threatening to harm herself. This behaviour is relentless to the point where the whole family becomes deeply distressed, and inevitably results in her getting the phone back. This obsession is affecting her schoolwork, and more severely her eyesight. She has become very shortsighted, and her eyesight continues to deteriorate as a result of holding the phone or laptop very close, and mostly in the dark without any lights on. My husband and I have a constant battle on our hands daily, in all areas of discipline with our daughter, but our main concern is that we have been unable to find a way to minimise this obsessive behaviour centred around her phone and laptop. Please can you provide some strategies that can help us specifically with this problem. First of all, I thank you for developing this program and I am only at the first stage of assignment 1.",
      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations."

      "Therefore, our calculation has two steps, similar to that in \\cite{hung14}. From the graphene bandstructures obtained using the tight-binding Hamiltonian above, we first look for the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ for a given $\\kappa_y$ of two graphene sections. The maximum of these energy gaps determines the gap $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ of transmission probability through the junction. Finally, the conduction gap $E_{cond.gap}$ is obtained by looking for the minimum value of $E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ when varying $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. In particular, the energy bands of strained graphene are given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E\\left( {\\vec k} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_1}}} + {t_2}{e^{i\\vec k{{\\vec a}_2}}} + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the plus/minus sign corresponds to the conduction/valence bands, respectively. For a given direction $\\phi$ of transport, in principle, the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y}$ defining the sizes of unit cell along the Ox and Oy directions, respectively, can be always expressed as ${\\vec L_x} = {n_1}{\\vec a_1} + {n_2}{\\vec a_2}$ and ${\\vec L_y} = {m_1}{\\vec a_1} + {m_2}{\\vec a_2}$ with $\\cos \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_x^0}}{{{L_x}L_x^0}}$ and $\\sin \\phi = \\frac{{{{\\vec L}_x}\\vec L_y^0}}{{{L_x}L_y^0}}$ while $\\vec L_{x,y}^0 = {\\vec a_1} \\pm {\\vec a_2}$. Note that $n_{1,2}$ and $m_{1,2}$ are integers while $\\frac{{{m_1}}}{{{m_2}}} =  - \\frac{{{n_1} + 2{n_2}}}{{{n_2} + 2{n_1}}}$, i.e., ${\\vec L_{x}} {\\vec L_{y}} = 0$. In other words, we have the following expressions\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{{{\\vec a}_1} = \\frac{{ - {m_2}{{\\vec L}_x} + {n_2}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}};\\,\\,\\,{{\\vec a}_2} = \\frac{{{m_1}{{\\vec L}_x} - {n_1}{{\\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nOn this basis, the energy bands can be rewritten in terms of $\\kappa_{x, y} = \\vec k \\vec L_{x,y} \\left( { \\equiv {k_{x,y}}{L_{x,y}}} \\right)$ by substituting Eqs.",
      "(7) into Eq. (6). This new form of energy bands is finally used to compute the conduction gap of strained junctions. As a simple example, in the case of $\\phi = 0$ (armchair direction), we calculate the conduction gap as follows. First, Eq. (6) is rewritten in the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E_{\\phi = 0}\\left( {\\vec \\kappa} \\right) =  \\pm \\left| {{t_1}{e^{i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_2}{e^{ - i\\kappa_y/2}} + {t_3}{e^{ - i\\kappa_x/2}}} \\right|\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the vectors $\\vec L_{x,y} \\equiv \\vec L_{x,y}^0$. Using this new form, the energy gap of strained graphene for a given $\\kappa_y$ is determined as\n\\begin{equation}\n{E_{strain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = 2 \\left| {\\sqrt {{{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2} + 4{t_1}{t_2}{{\\cos }^2}\\frac{{{\\kappa_y}}}{2}}  + {t_3}} \\right|\n\\end{equation}\nwhile ${E_{unstrain}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ is given by the same formula with $t_1$ = $t_2$ = $t_3$ $\\equiv$ $t_0$. The gap of transmission probability through the junction is then determined as ${E_{junc}^{gap}}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right) = \\max \\left[ {E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right),E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ and, finally, the conduction gap is given by ${E_{cond.gap}} = \\min \\left[ {E_{junc}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)} \\right]$ for $\\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone. We would like to notice that the Green's function calculations and the banstructure analyses give the same results of conduction gap in the junctions where the transition region between unstrained and strained graphene sections is long enough, i.e., larger than about 5 to 6 nm. In the case of short length, as discussed in \\cite{baha13,hung14}, this transition zone can have significant effects on the transmission between propagating states beyond the energy gaps and hence can slightly enlarge the gap of conductance, compared to the results obtained from the bandstructure calculations. \\section{Results and discussion}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{Fig02.pdf}\n\\caption{Dependence of graphene bandgap (in the unit of eV) on the applied strain and its direction: tensile (a) and compressive (b).",
      "The appearance of this conduction gap, as mentioned previously, is due to the strain-induced shift of Dirac points and is explained as follows. Actually, the strain causes the lattice deformation and can result in the deformation of graphene bandstructure. Therefore, the bandedges as a function of wave-vector $k_y$ in unstrained and strained graphene can be illustrated schematically as in the top panel of Fig. 4. As one can see, the shift of Dirac points leads to the situation where there is no value of $\\kappa_y$, for which the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are simultaneously equal to zero. This means that the transmission probability always shows a finite gap for any $\\kappa_y$. For instance, the energy gap is zero (or small) in the unstrained (resp. strained) graphene section but finite in the strained (resp. unstrained) one in the vicinity of Dirac point $k_y = K_{unstrain}$ (resp. $K_{strain}$). Accordingly, as illustrated in the pictures of LDOS in the left panels of Fig. 4 and confirmed in the corresponding transmissions in the right panels, clear gaps of transmission are still obtained. Far from these values of $k_y$, $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\\left( {{\\kappa_y}} \\right)$ are both finite (e.g., see the LDOS plotted for $k_y = K_{gap}$) and hence a finite gap of transmission also occurs. On this basis, a finite gap of conductance is achieved. More important, Fig. 3 shows that besides the strength of strain, the strain effect is also strongly dependent on the applied direction. For instance, the conduction gap takes the values of $\\sim$ 295, 172 and 323 meV for $\\theta = 0$, $30^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. Below, we will discuss the properties of the conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction, and the direction of transport. Note that due to the lattice symmetry, the transport directions $\\phi$ and $\\phi + 60^\\circ$ are equivalent while the applied strain of angle $\\theta$ is identical to that of $\\theta + 180^\\circ$."

    "documentation": [
      "In addition, the control architecture is modular, so the synergy grasp mapping component can be easily changed in order to control several precision grasp types. However, our experiments also revealed various limitations of our controller. For example our method fails to stabilize the object when rotational slip occurs. In addition hardware limitations such as, slow update rates and noise in the force measurements can create problems that result in the object falling. In future work we plan to incorporate additional sensing modalities, such as vision to alleviate some of these issues.",
      "In our work we use the FTS3 sensors which is a low-cost sensor that measures the 3D force applied in each fingertip. In addition, previous works gathered labeled datasets in order to train their slip prediction models which is time-consuming and limits the possible orientations of the hand, because gathering labeled data for all possible orientations is impractical. To overcome this we experimentally selected the parameters that determine the value of the applied normal force such that we avoid slip for all objects in our dataset, from the lightest to the heaviest. In order to guarantee contact between the fingertip and the object, in the beginning of the grasping phase, we use an offset f of f set n as the minimum normal force applied by each finger. In they also suggest that humans use an additional safety margin which is proportional to the tangential force, f margin n ∝ f t . So the final desired normal contact force becomes: where G is the gain that includes the friction coefficient and the additional safety margin. To alleviate the effects of noise in the sensors, the running average of the measured normal force f n and tangential force f t is used, as a low pass filter. So for each force measurement we have the following relation: where α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter that determines how much new measurements affect the value, and is experimentally selected. Given the measured normal force f n from the fingertip sensors we can compute the error f err n = f des n − f n . We use this error signal to control the grasp size variable g size , that we use as a conditional variable in our posture mapping function. The grasp size represents the distance between the thumb and the index finger in a grasp posture. So a smaller grasp size will result in a tighter grasp and greater normal force applied to the surface of the object. We use a linear controller for the grasp size variable that is implemented as follows: where K is a parameter that controls the rate of decrease of the grasp size, and is experimentally selected.",
      "You can see the execution of the third experiment in the middle part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to perform robot to human handovers. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the vertical position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, the arm stays still, the human grasps the object from the bottom and slightly pushes it up, the hand then detects that there is a supporting surface and starts to slowly release the object. You can see the execution of the fourth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . This experiment is similar to previous one, but the grasp type that the robot uses is a pinch grasp, that involves only the thumb and the index finger. To perform this we only had to alter the grasp type conditional variable that was given to the posture mapping function. You can see the execution of the fifth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . In the first part (blue) of the experiment the robot closes its grasp, by reducing the grasp size, until the normal force is below the force offset. In the next three parts (pink, green, red) the person throws coins in the cup to increase its weight. You can see in the signal plots that each time coins are added the tangential force decreases so the normal force threshold decreases too. The grasp sizes then decreases as well in order to apply more normal force. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle perturbations in the weight of the object during grasping. CONCLUSION In summary, we presented a controller that uses force feedback integrated with conditional synergies to control a dexterous robotic hand to grasp and release objects. We demonstrated that our controller can lift objects of different weights and materials while avoiding slip, react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans.",
      "So when the error between the desired normal force and the actual normal force is large the grasp size decreases so tighter grasp postures are generated in order to apply more normal force. In practice, in order to avoid oscillations in the grasp size we use the desired normal force as a high threshold that we want the measured normal force to be below:\nIf the normal force is below that threshold the grasp size does not change even if there are small oscillations in the measured tangential and normal forces. Also, in order to avoid the hand applying too much force that damages the hardware or the object we use a low threshold, that is: where w threshold is the width of the threshold in mN . If the measured normal force is below the grasp size increases in order to apply less force. So the final grasp size variable for grasping is calculated as follows: where This is similar to the deadband control method , where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. If the response is in this range, the controller does not exert any correction. In our case, the operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. The grasp posture mapping function is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in . It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size. In this work we augment this model to also generate grasp postures conditioned on the grasp type. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate grasps based on more general characteristics such as the type and the size of the grasp. In this way we can control all the fingers jointly by a single value, the grasp size, thus greatly reducing the control parameters. In addition we are able to use the same control algorithm for different precision grasp types, by changing the grasp type conditional variable.",
      "To choose between grasping or releasing an object we use a finite state machine formulation. When the hand reaches the desired grasp pose, which we assume is provided, the GRASP state is activated, in which the controller tries to grasp the object. When the controller detects that the tangential force applied to the object is coming from a support surface the state changes to the RELEASE state, in which the controller releases the object by opening the grasp. You can see the full algorithm in Python-like pseudocode in Figure . To summarize, the advantages of our controller compared with previous approaches are threefold: 1) instead of controlling each joint of each finger of the hand we use only two variables, the grasp size and the grasp type, which allows us to perform multiple grasp types by changing only one variable while the grasp size variable is common among all grasp types, that greatly reduces the complexity of the control process compared to independently controlling a 21 DoF hand to perform different grasp types, 2) we do not rely on slip prediction for controlling the desired normal force, which involves gathering labeled data and works only for the hand poses in the training dataset, and 3) we can use our controller to also release objects instead of only grasping them. Experimental Set-up. For our experiments we used the Seed Robotics RH8D Hand , which is a robotic hand with 7 DoFs. The hand is equipped with the FTS-3 force sensors in each fingertip, which are high resolution tactile sensors that provide the 3D force applied in each fingertip. The sensor provides data at a rate of 50Hz. For the experiments the hand was mounted on a Kinova Gen3 7DoF robot. To train the posture mapping function we used the CyberGlove to teleoperate the hand and collect 468 grasps belonging to three precision grasp  types: tripod, pinch, lateral tripod. The architecture of the cVAE model was the same as in , with the addition of the grasp type as a conditional variable, which was one-hot encoded."

These documents were approved and signed by Sonny Partono (Director General of Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem MoEF), Sjarief Widjaja (Secretary General MMAF), and Djoko Suprianto (Acting Head of MFA of West Nusa Tenggara Province). Due to this MoU and TCA no specific research permit was required. We collected data by measuring sharks that were already caught, dead, and landed by fishers in Tanjung Luar, with no incentives, compensation or specific requests for killing sharks for this study. WCS participates in the Conservation Initiative on Human Rights and the rules and guidelines of our Internal Review Board ensures that any research protects the rights of human subjects. We did not apply for an IRB permit for this study because our study design focused on collecting fish and fisheries data as opposed to personal socio-economic data. The FDGs and interviews were conducted to obtain early scoping information about fishing practices, and to establish protocols for more detailed fisheries data collection (as used in this study), and socio-economic data collection (as used in a later study (Lestari et al ), which underwent further ethical review due to the specific focus on human subjects). Tanjung Luar, located in East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia (Fig 1), is a landing site for one of Indonesia’s most well-known targeted shark fisheries. Tanjung Luar serves at least 1,000 vessels, and the majority of these are less than 10 gross tonnes (GT) in size . A group of specialised fishers operating from Tanjung Luar village and a neighbouring island, Gili Maringkik, specifically target sharks. Shark catch is landed in a dedicated auction facility at the Tanjung Luar port.",
      "The shark industry is well established in Tanjung Luar, with product processing facilities and trade connections to local, national and international markets. Research by Lestari et al.  indicates that the shark industry is significantly more profitable than non-shark fisheries in Tanjung Luar, particularly for boat owners. Strong patron-client relationships exist between boat owners and fishers, with shark fishers exhibiting high dependency on shark fishing, limited occupational diversity and low adaptive capacity for shifting into other fisheries . Fig 1. Sharks landing monitoring site and fishing grounds of shark fishers that land at Tanjung Luar. In January 2014 we conducted preliminary scoping research to better understand the operational and socioeconomic characteristics of Tanjung Luar’s shark fishery. During a three-week scoping visit a team of four trained Indonesian enumerators conducted semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FDGs) with fishers, boat owners and traders, alongside naturalistic observation in the field. Respondents were selected through purposive sampling, since the research was exploratory in nature and a priori sampling decisions were not possible . We conducted a total of 34 semi-structured interviews (S1 File) and four FDGs, which were attended by a total of 30 individuals. All interviews and discussions took place in Indonesian, with the help of a local enumerator who was fluent in the Tanjung Luar local dialect. Interviews took approximately 30 minutes, with no remuneration for participating. All respondents gave their full prior and informed consent before contributing to the research. During the interviews and FDGs we gathered information on number of boats, fishing gears used, fishing grounds, fishery operational characteristics, and shark supply chain, including estimated volumes and value of shark catch relative to other fisheries. We improved the accuracy of information on shark fishery characteristics and fishing behaviour through informal daily interactions and discussions with 131 shark fishers during our daily landings data collection and community engagement activities.",

Here are a few that seem to have worked for others..fight harder, recruit better, spend less time complaining and more time organizing, budget for more cubes or quit. I'd rather not see you opt for the latter.. but to each their own. I agree, we should find a way to honor the dead, but I don't think keeping their towers infinitely is necessarily the solution. The game must go on. I'm pretty sure the point of bot decay was to clear the game of inactive player bots so that new players can have a chance to rise up, not to dishonor the bots of dead players.

It was fun. Swarm had me scared at first, but it turned into kind of a bullying match between us and legion. Last hour became p obvious which way it was gonna go. Legion rly stepped up their game in the end there, respect. We are investigating this. Here is what we know: Several of the accounts used the same password. Most of the accounts belonged to people who knew each other personally. The accounts were all switched from the same IP Addresses. The person who logged in, got into each account on the first attempt, so they knew the password for each account. What you should know: QONQR never stores passwords, not even in the logs. Passwords are hashed (one way encrypted) and can never be decrypted When you authenticate to our servers, we hash the password you gave us and compare it to the encrypted password in the database to see if they match. Access to our database in the could is restricted tightly and we are confident no one breached the system. What you should do: Don't use the same password as other people you play with. Don't share your password with anyone. I heard all the French players fled to the UK after one German player accidentally shot a single missile into France. Most factions now use GroupMe or Line as their means of communication, the forums are too slow as a means of communication and insecure for specific faction conversations.

I want to start by thanking Faceless. This round of Atlantis, Legion and Faceless were doubled in sized and probably spending by Swarm. I contacted some great players from the other side and put together a nonaggression pact, this pact was one of the most impressive agreements I've seen in the more than two years of playing. Hundreds of people worldwide stuck to this agreement and put past feelings behind us. It was awesome to see both sides stick so closely to each other in fighting against Swarm. I want to really thank everyone who showed honor by standing behind me and the faceless command when we suggested that, the people who really gave it a chance and then most importantly, to all the players who honored it. Faceless, thank you very much! We stood no chance of winning without you! The battle came down to literally one launch in one of three zones. I'd say that with that being said everyone fought incredibly hard, so I want to give Swarm the respect they deserve. You guys really show out and play to win. Good game, 2 against 1 is not easy, no matter how large your crew is. And Legion, we had many late, late nights, many very long days. You guys killed it this month!

Indeed, starting from Eq. \\eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account.

As we will see more in details in the following, being interested in inferring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \\eqref{eq:H_J} since they do not depend on $\\mathbb{T}$ not adding any information on the gradients with respect to the elements of $\\mathbb{T}$.\n  \n Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, and  ordering the input fields in the first $N/2$ mode indices and the output fields in the last $N/2$ indices, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function\n    \\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\label{eq:z}\n && Z =\\int_{\\mathcal S} \\prod_{j=1}^{N} dE_j \\left(   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\Delta^2}} \\right)^{N/2} \n \\hspace*{-.4cm} \\exp\\left\\{\n  -\\frac{ {\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] }{2\\Delta^2}\n  \\right\\}\n  \\\\\n&&{\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] =\n-  \\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}\\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} \\left[E^*_j t_{jk} E_k + E_j t^*_{kj} E_k^* \n\\right]\n \\nonumber\n\\\\\n&&\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad + \\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} |E_j|^2+ \\sum_{k,l}^{1,N/2}E_k\nU_{kl} E_l^*\n \\nonumber\n \\\\\n \\label{eq:H_J}\n &&\\hspace*{1.88cm } = - \\sum_{nm}^{1,N} E_n J_{nm} E_m^*\n \\end{eqnarray}\n where ${\\cal H}$ is a real-valued function by construction, we have introduced the effective input-input coupling matrix\n\\begin{equation}\nU_{kl} \\equiv \\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N}t^*_{lj} t_{jk} \n \\label{def:U}\n \\end{equation}\n and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\\mathbb{T} \\equiv \\{ t_{jk} \\}$)\n \\begin{equation}\n \\label{def:J}\n \\mathbb J\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}\n \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}&-\\mathbb{U} \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&{\\mathbb{T}}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\hline\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}& \\mathbb   T^\\dagger&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}& - \\mathbb{I} &\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}\\\\\n \\end{array}\\right)\n \\end{equation}\n \n Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude configurations that minimize the {\\em cost function} ${\\cal H}$, Eq.

      "(\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases. The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}. With \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal. Otherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textcolor{red}{\nF: comment about quenched:",
      "Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\\rm in,out}_k$ the input/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \\times 4$ M{\\\"u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \\cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n E^{\\rm out}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\\rm in}_i \\qquad \\forall~ k=1,\\ldots,N_O\n \\label{eq:transm}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\\\ \nIn the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,\nwhere $E^{\\rm out}_k$, $E^{\\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars.

Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, \n rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq.",
      "I think that to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess). Indeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones. For this, what it is necessary to have the XY model, it is that the intensities are always the same on the different samples\n(so that the matrix $t_{ij}$ is the same for different phase data).

      "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume. To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value. While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.",
      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents."

      "Dysjaland and Tananger also acquired new sports arenas. A new cultural centre built in central Sola has a distinctive architecture in brick and glass, with a grassed roof to blend with the surrounding Jæren landscape. With two stages and a public library, this became the community’s main venue for events and so forth. The local authority thereby built up a very good infrastructure. Power cables were laid in the same trenches as water and sewage pipes, a network of cycle lanes was built and street lighting installed. On the downside, virtually all these investments boosted operating expenses. The council’s running costs rose by an annual average of 30 per cent in 1978-84, with the biggest growth in the last three years of the period. So the calls by Storting representatives to transfer agio tax receipts from councils to central government represented a real threat to local politicians. Sola joined forces with other local authorities in the same position, including Stavanger, Oslo and Bærum as well as Rogaland county council. A delegation met the Storting’s standing committee on finance to present their case, and secured a commitment to accept a phased reduction in revenues over four years. The local authorities would receive 80 per cent of agio tax receipts during the first year, then 60 per cent, 40 per cent and finally 20 per cent.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act adopted on 14 May 1982.

      "Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history. In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu. History\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan. Yerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007. Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.",

      "for details. The chosen rank of each case is also shown in Table . Figure shows the comparison of original excitations and reconstructed results of these three cases, which all have excellent agreement. show the results computed by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. In all cases, the sums of the first three orders of responses agree well with those obtained by the Runge-Kutta method. The contributions of the first three orders of responses for each case are plotted in Figs. )-21(b). Similarly, the system vibration is dominated by the first-order response. However, the contributions of second-and third-order significantly grow with increasing excitation magnitude and frequency number. Furthermore, when the magnitude of the nonlinear response becomes large, sharp troughs are present. This phenomenon may be induced by the nonlinear stiffness. While the first-order response fails to capture these troughs, the higher-order responses successfully capture these troughs. Figure plots the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for the irregular loading in Case 1 by the proposed method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method, respectively. While the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method is more efficient under a small response length, the proposed method becomes much more efficient when the response length is larger than about 130 s. In addition, the proposed method obtains the explicit response solution, so one can directly obtain the response value at a specific time t p instead of integrating from 0 to t p for traditional numerical methods.

When the Volterra kernel functions are known, we can follow the procedure in Section 4.1 to predict system responses.",
      "All cases have same amplitudes. The poles of a sinusoidal excitation are λ 1,2 = ±iΩ, and the residues are α 1,2 = ∓iA/2. Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for different cases are listed in Table . Table : Parameter values, poles and residues of the sinusoidal excitation Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well as those of the system into Eqs.\n20 and 19, response coefficients β p i ,k corresponding to system poles −a i and response coefficients γ p i ,ℓ corresponding to excitation poles λ ℓ are calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the first three orders of responses for each case in Table are calculated. Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with ∆t = 10 −4 . For Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution. When the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases. In each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero. This may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27.",
      "Moreover, it is clearly observed that second-order responses for Cases 3-5 exhibit a periodic oscillation with a period near half of that for the first-order response, which is excited by the sum frequency component of the excitation (see second part of Eq. 27). Compared with steady-state solutions of first-and second-order responses, those of third-order responses in Cases 3-5 are no longer single regular motions. By performing the FFT, frequency spectra of these three third-order responses are shown in Fig. . We find that these three third-order responses are all dominated by their own fundamental harmonic component and the third harmonic (triple frequency) component. Figure shows the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for Case 1 by the proposed method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method. The proposed method, which has an explicit solution, is much more efficient in computational time than the latter two methods, which need small time steps to obtain high-precision solutions. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed method increases with the length of the response time.

Table lists three cases of these parameters. In each case, the amplitudes of all components are the same, and phase angles θ n uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π are randomly generated. To decompose the excitation into a pole-residue form, the Prony-SS method is used, whose concept is similar to that of a principal component method. The readers are referred to Ref.",
      "In this study, the input excitation is white noise with a constant power spectrum S 0 = 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 28 by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. . From Section 4.1, we determine that the sum of the first two orders of responses agrees well with the total response. In this study, the order of Volterra series N is chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a 1 = a 2 = 2, and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R 1 = R 2 = 24. To estimate the first two orders of Volterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructed using excitation data and response data. By using the least square method to solve this matrix equation, coefficients c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 in Eq. 8 are identified. Figure plots c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 , respectively, which have good agreement with the exact results in Fig. . Then, the first two order Volterra kernel functions are constructed by Eq. 6. Compared with the exact results in Figs. , the identified Volterra kernel functions in Fig. completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that the white noise excitation, which can excite more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obtain good Volterra kernel functions. A regular excitation f (t) = sin(πt) and an irregular excitation f (t) = N f n=1 A n cos(Ω n t + θ n ) with A n = 0.3 and Ω n varying from 0 to 40 with equal interval 1 are chosen as input excitations. The predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are shown in Fig. . In both cases, the proposed method accurately predicts system responses. As presented in Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natural response y s (t), forced response y f (t) and cross response y c (t). These individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitations, are shown in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. and 28, both first-and second-order responses include the natural response y s (t) and the forced response y f (t), but the cross response y c (t) only exists in second-order responses."

The only reason for any nation to buy the 767 tanker is going to be because of the ability to hard bargain with Boeing given that the commercial future of the 767 is dead.

The sensor system placed in the residences of volunteers needs to meet several specific physiological signals and activity monitoring needs. However, we must confirm that the devices are reliable with potential for re-deployment as well as appear unintimidating to the participants. Inspired by the above requirements, we developed a real testbed IoT system, {\\it SenseBox}, by customizing Cloud Engine PogoPlug Mobile base station firmware to integrate with WiFi (connect ambient and object sensors) and Bluetooth (connect wristband) protocol. The smart home components are as follows: (i) PogoPlug base server with a continuous power supply, (ii) 3 binary Passive Infrared sensors in three different rooms (kitchen, livingroom and bedroom) to capture room level occupancy, (iii) 7 binary object sensors attached with closet door, entry door, telephone, broom, laundry basket, trash can and trash box, (iv) three IP cameras in the appropriate positions to collect the ground truth data and (v) an Empatica E4 \\cite{empatica} wrist-band (integrated sensors: PPG at 64 Hz, EDA at 4 Hz, Body temperature at 1 Hz and a triaxial ACC at 32 Hz) on the participant's dominating hand.",
      "Ambient sensors also help capture the movement patterns of objects and humans for activity and behavior recognition \\cite{dawadi14,dawadi15}. Researchers also proved the existence of correlations between cognitive impairment and everyday task performance \\cite{dawadi14, akl15,alam16} as well as physiological symptoms \\cite{alam16,sano15}. Although current studies showed some successes in IoT-assisted cognitive health assessment in different domains individually, there are several existing challenges in developing and validating a fully automated multi-modal assessment model. \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{Real-time IoT System}: A real-time IoT system must include a continuous and fault tolerant data streaming capability among central hub, wearable sensors and ambient sensors regardless of network communication protocol (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth etc.) which are not available in existing researches. \\item \\emph{Multi-modal Context Fusion}: Though several offline clinically validated cognitive health assessment tools exist \\cite{wai03, starling99, krapp07, yesavage82, zung71}, there is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older adults \\cite{akl15, dawadi15}. Researchers also showed wearable Electrodermal Activity pattern analysis may carry the significance of cognitive status \\cite{sano15}. However, for validation of IoT based cognitive health assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers \\cite{akl15, dawadi15, sano15, alam16}. \\end{enumerate}\n\nRegarding aforementioned challenges for the automation of cognitive health assessment, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} considers (i) reproducibility of our model in any smart home system consists of ambient motion sensors, wearable accelerometer (ACC) sensors, wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors individually or combined streams; (ii) context awareness based on ambient motion sensors and wearable ACC sensors in any types of activities such as hand gestural, postural and complex ADLs; and (iii) high accuracy, i.e., a recall rate of over 90\\% with less than 5\\% false positive rate.",
      "We validate and compare \\emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets. \\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation} For collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent. The gender diversity in the recruited participants reflects the gender distribution (85\\% female and 15\\% male) in the retirement community facility. A trained gerontology graduate student evaluator completes surveys with participants to fill out the surveys. Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \\emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability. We follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode \\cite{hugo14}.",
      "Akl et. al. proposed 18 gesture dictionary based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier \\cite{akl11}. Wrist-worn ACC based postural activity recognition approach has been proposed using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and deep neural networks \\cite{gj14, wang16}, the accuracy stagnates at 85\\% using SVM method \\cite{martin16}. However, neither of past works proposed any technique that can provide single body worn ACC sensor-based multiple body contexts recognition nor works efficiently for diverse posture say walking normally, with walker, with double walker or wheel chair. Our proposed 8-hand gesture recognition technique assisted sparse-deconvolution method improves classification performances on both normal and diverse postures. However, we incorporated hand gestures and postures in conjunction with ambient sensors into single-inhabitant HDBN model \\cite{alam16b} that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition.\n\\subsection{Cognitive Health Assessment}\nSmart home environment has been used for providing automated health monitoring and assessment in the ageing population before \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}. `SmartFABER' proposed a non-intrusive sensor network based continuous smart home environmental sensor data acquisition and a novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique to analyz the data to estimate behavioral anomalies for early detection of mild-cognitively impairment \\cite{riboni16}. \\cite{skubic15} presented an example of unobtrusive, continuous monitoring system for the purpose of assessing early health changes to alert caregivers about the potential signs of health hazards. Though, prior researches proposed a sequence of ambient motion sensor streams as complex activity components in activity based health assessment \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}, we consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings to help recognize complex activities as well as cognitive health assessment of older adults."

      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Most of the studies describe bubble characteristics and flows morphology from a macroscopic view. The mesoscopic characteristics such as the kinetic effects which help understand the kinetic process, are rarely to be studied. (iii) Further studies of effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI process. The specific-heat ratio is an essential index for studying the compressibility of the gas. Research from Igra et al. has shown that the differences in the specific-heat ratio of bubbles would cause various wave patterns and pressure distribution inside the bubbles during the interaction process . Besides, many works on hydrodynamic instability have also demonstrated the importance of investigating the specific-heat ratio effect . Among these, Chen et al. investigated the specific-heat ratio effects on temperature gradient and the TNE characteristics of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) system . For the above three points, in this work we apply the recently proposed discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) . The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) research has two complementary branches . One aims to work as a kind of new scheme for numerical solving various partial differential equation(s). The other aims to work as a kind of new method for constructing kinetic model to bridge the macro and micro descriptions. The two branches have different goals and consequently have different rules. The current DBM is developed from the second branch of LBM and focusing more on the Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE) behaviors that the macro modeling generally ignore. It breaks through the continuity and near-equilibrium assumptions of traditional fluid modeling, discards the lattice gas image of standard LBM, and adds various methods based on phase space for checking, exhibiting, describing and analyzing the non-equilibrium state and resulting effects. More information extraction technologies and analysis methods for complex field are introduced with time. The numerical simulation includes three parts, as shown in Fig. .",
      "Strictly speaking, those TNE intensity and effect descriptions that do not account for the research perspective are not correct. Do not explain the research perspective, the corresponding is not dependent on the research perspective. Numerical simulations and results\n\nIn this section, we first validate the DBM code by comparing the DBM results with experimental results. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on the dynamic process and TNE behaviors on SBI are investigated. Comparison with experimental results\n\nIn the following part, we use a first-order two-fluid DBM to simulate the interaction between a planar shock wave with a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubbles, and compare the DBM results with the experimental results from Ref. . The computational configuration can be seen in Fig. . In a flow field which is filled with Air, there is a static bubble composed of 26% Air and 74% SF 6 . A shock with Ma = 1.2 would pass through the bubble from left to right. The initial conditions of ambient gas are ρ 0 = 1.29kg/m 3 , T 0 = 293K, p 0 = 101.3kPa. Ignoring the pressure difference between interior gas and ambient gas, the initial parameters of the bubble are ρ bubble = 4.859kg/m 3 , p bubble = 101.3kPa,\nand T 0 = 293K. For simulating, these actual physical quantities should be transferred to dimensionless parameters. This process can refer to the Appendix A. The dimensionless conditions of macroscopic quantities of the fluid field in initial time are (ρ, T, u x , u y ) bubble = (4.0347, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 1 = (1.3416,\n1.128, 0.3616, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 0 = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), where the subscript \"0\" (\"1\") represents downstream (upstream) region. In two-fluid DBM code, the distribution function f Air is used to describe the ambient gas, i.e., Air. The f bubble characters the bubble which is a mixture that composed of Air and SF 6 . The grid number is N x × N y = 800 × 400, where the N x and N y are grid number in x and y direction, respectively. This grid size has passed the mesh convergence test.",
      "Two kinds of analysis methods, including tracer particle method and two-fluid model, are used to characterize qualitatively the macroscopic behaviors such as the shape, deformation process, mixing degree, etc. The related TNE behaviors are also studied. Effects of specific-heat ratio on jet shape, deformation process, and average motion\n\nWe first observe the specific-heat ratio effect on the bubble shape from the view of density contour and images of particle tracer visually. As shown in Fig. , pictures with three typical moments are plotted, i.e., t = 0.07,t = 0.11, and t = 0.16. The odd rows represent density contours and the even rows are tracer particle images. It can be seen that the specific-heat ratio significantly affects the length and shape of the jet structure. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. The reason is that the specific-heat ratio significantly changes the propagation speed of shock waves and wave patterns inside the bubble. The specific-heat ratio also influences the vortex structure in early stage but contributes little effects to it in later stage. In the later stage, for cases with different specific-heat ratios, the differences in vortex pairs are almost invisible. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on deformation process are analyzed. Shown in Fig. are the evolutions of characteristic scales which used to describe the bubble size, i.e., width and length. It can be seen that the smaller the specific-heat ratio of bubble, the smaller the bubble width and length. For the fluid with smaller specific-heat ratio, it is easier to be compressed. Therefore, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. It can also be seen that the case with the largest specific-heat ratio reaches the minimum characteristic scales firstly. The reason is that the shock wave propagates faster in case with larger specific-heat ratio. Through the method of tracer, information on the average motion of the bubble is easy to obtain."

      "In particular, a large fraction of ribosomal protein mRNAs is downregulated upon Met/Cys starvation (Fig 2A and 2C; S1 File), consistent with the notion that their genes–despite being scattered throughout the genome—are coordinately expressed in a variety of conditions . This reduced expression may depend on multiple pathways that control ribosome biogenesis in response to external stimuli, including the downregulation of Myc activity , the downregulation of mTORC1 [42, 44], or possibly the activation of the ISR, as described in yeast . By contrast, upregulated genes show a significant enrichment for transcription and gene expression (Fig 2B). Similar results were obtained by the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) database (S1 File), overall indicating a general downregulation of translation and metabolism, and upregulation of transcription, during the time interval of Met/Cys starvation corresponding to the transgene upregulation. Fig 2. Gene set enrichment analysis of Met/Cys-deprived HeLa cells. Differentially expressed genes between three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change of at least 2, leading to a total of 996 upregulated, and 1037 downregulated genes. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, using the EnrichR tool and the KEGG (A) and REACTOME (B, C) databases. Ranking is based on the combined score provided by EnrichR, and categories are displayed up to 20 items with an Adjusted P value <0.05. No significant categories were found with upregulated genes against the KEGG database. All data are shown in S1 File. The enrichment analysis using all differentially expressed genes together did not reveal any additional enriched process. To characterize the pathway leading to the reactivation of silenced transgenes, we used HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, as described . In addition, to test cell types relevant for AA metabolism, such as liver and muscle, we generated clones of HepG2 human hepatoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells, stably transfected with plasmids for OA1 and GFP transgenes, respectively (HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells; endogenous OA1 is not expressed in any of these cell types).",
      "Alternatively, differentially expressed repeat subfamilies were identified by averaging three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Repeats significantly up- or downregulated (104 and 77, respectively) were selected based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance), and analyzed for their class enrichment by a Fisher Exact test as described above. For gene set enrichment analysis of Met/Cys deprived vs control HeLa cells, differentially expressed genes were selected considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls, based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance) and a fold change >2. This led to a total of 2033 differentially expressed genes, 996 upregulated and 1037 downregulated. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, or with all differentially expressed genes together (both), using the KEGG database. The analysis was performed with correction for the background of all expressed genes (about 13600 genes showing an average expression over 3 starvation and 3 control samples of at least 5 counts) and by using default parameters (adjusted P value and q-value cut-off of <0.05 and 0.2, respectively). Differentially expressed genes were also selected considering all starvation time points, as with genomic repeats, by maSigPro using default parameters, and a fold change of at least 1.5, leading to similar enrichment results (not shown). RNAseq gene expression data are available in the ArrayExpress database under the accession number E-MTAB-6452. To provide proof-of-principle that AA starvation may affect the expression of transposable elements, we performed an RNAseq analysis of the previously described HeLa-OA1 cells, carrying an integrated and partially silenced OA1 transgene . Since the reactivation of the transgene by starvation is a progressive phenomenon , we performed a time-course experiment, where each time point represents one biological sample, rather than a biological triplicate of a single time point.",
      "In particular, Cluster 1 contains sequences that, similarly to the OA1 transgene, are progressively upregulated upon starvation (Fig 1A and 1C) , while Cluster 2 contains sequences that are upregulated at early time points. Interestingly, repeat families that are significantly enriched in these two clusters belong mostly to the group of LTR-retrotransposons, including ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR and other LTR sequences (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). By contrast, DNA transposons (such as TcMar-Tigger) and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons are enriched among repeats that are downregulated during starvation, particularly at late time points (Clusters 3 and 4) (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). Consistent results were obtained by selecting significantly up- or downregulated genomic repeats (overall 181 species), based on their average expression out of three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h, when the transgene upregulation is more homogeneous) and controls, and on a P value <0.05 (S1B and S2B Figs). These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that—among major repeat classes—it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs. In addition, to obtain a general overview of main gene pathways changing their expression together with the transgene during AA starvation, we performed gene expression and enrichment analyses of regular genes, by considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Differentially expressed genes were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change between means of at least 2, and analyzed with the EnrichR tool . As shown in Fig 2 and S1 File, enrichment analyses against the KEGG and Reactome databases reveals a predominance of downregulated pathways, namely ribosome and translation, proteasome, AA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways related to mitochondrial functions, which are affected in Huntington, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).",
      "To this aim, cells were cultured either in normal medium, or in absence of Met/Cys for different time points (6-15-30-72-120 hours), resulting in the progressive upregulation of the OA1 transgene during starvation (Fig 1A and 1B), consistent with previously published results . The expression of genomic repeats was determined according to RepeatMasker annotation and classification into classes, families, and subfamilies. Repeat species were then subjected to differential expression and enrichment analyses in starved vs control conditions. Out of 1396 annotated repeat subfamilies, 172 species displayed a differential expression profile during starvation. Fig 1. Exogenous transgene and endogenous retroviruses are upregulated in Met/Cys-deprived HeLa cells.

(C) Clustering of 172 genomic repeat subfamilies, differentially expressed upon starvation, according to their expression profile. (D) Class distribution of repeat subfamilies belonging to differential expression clusters, compared to all genomic repeat subfamilies (first column). Class DNA includes DNA transposons; SINE includes Alu; LINE includes L1 an L2; LTR includes endogenous retroviruses and solitary LTRs; Satellite includes centromeric acrosomal and telomeric satellites; Others includes SVA, simple repeats, snRNA, and tRNAs. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enriched among repeats that are downregulated. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 (Fisher exact test). As shown in Fig 1C, the clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions, i.e. upregulation upon starvation and no change in regular medium (Cluster 1 and 2).",
      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells.

      "Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins. U.S. Mail: Densmore Associates, inc. ANSI \"D\" size, computer generated plots of all the layout drawings in this series are available from the author for $30 plus postage & handling. Full (true size) scale plots may be made available depending on demand. \"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members. This scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base. First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door. In the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University.",
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch.",
      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

      "And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again. If that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic. Plus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse. You did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments. And like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear. Like every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history. Many kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits. Our immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them. The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible.",
      "It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so. Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians. \"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day. And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen. What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again. \"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children? Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur? And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive.",
      "But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice. At the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage. You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hernández, De Long, Ferández."

      "\\section{Introduction}\\label{S1}\n\nThe multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user\nlimitation in CDMA systems \\cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean\nsquare-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method\nis a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)\nreceivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this\nmethod and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \\cite{R5}\n(see also \\cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is\nsubtracted before making the decision for a specific user in\ndifferent stages \\cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity. Unlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC. In each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \\ref{S4}\nthe modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase\nestimation is introduced. In section \\ref{S5} some simulation\nexamples illustrate the results of the proposed method."

      "Baselines\n\nTo evaluate our methodology, we compare our method to the following baselines: (1) no-comm, where agents do not communicate; (2) rl-comm, which uses a baseline communication method learned solely through policy loss ; (3) ae-comm, which uses an autoencoder to ground communication in input observations ; (4) VQ-VIB, which uses a variational autoencoder to ground discrete communication in input observations and a mutual information objective to ensure low entropy communication . We provide an ablation of the loss parameter β in table 1 in the blind traffic junction scenario. When β = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When β = 1, the model was unable to converge. However, when there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse (with no guarantees about referential representation). We attribute this to the fact that our independence criteria learns a stronger causal relationship. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to take an incorrect action. In order to understand the effect of the independent concept representation, we analyze the emergent language's capacity for redundancy. A message token m l is redundant if there exists another token m k that represents the same information. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task. With a soft discrete threshold, the independent information loss naturally converges to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary. Our β ablation in table 1 yields a bijection between each token in the vocabulary and the possible emergent concepts, i.e., the enumerated observations and intents. Thus for β = 0.1, there is no redundancy. Sparse Communication In corollary 4.3, we assume that there is no mutual information between tokens. In practice, the loss may only be near-zero. Our empirical results yield independence loss around 1e − 4.",
      "In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information. Despite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Since the base unit for the token is a 32-bit float, we note that each token in the message may be further compressed. We observe that each token uses three significant digits, which may further compress tokens to 10 bits each for a total message length of 20 bits. Communication Utility Results\n\nDue to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding. In the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement. That is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term. Regularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity.",

Blind Traffic Junction Social shadowing enables significantly lower sample complexity when compared to traditional online MARL. Beta ablation: Messages are naturally sparse in bits due to the complexity loss. Redundancy measures the capacity for a bijection between the size of the set of unique tokens and the enumerated observations and intents. Min redundancy is 1.0 (a bijection).Lower is better. abstract\n\nExplicit communication among humans is key to coordinating and learning. Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample complexity, and solve partially observable tasks. Emergent communication, a type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language to encode a high task-utility message directly from data.",
      "Thus, we should seek to make the complexity loss more convex. Our compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance convergence. While the complexity loss tends to spike in the exploratory phase, the normalized value is very small. Interestingly, the method eventually converges as the complexity loss converges below a normal- ized 0.3. Additionally, the contrastive loss tends to decrease monotonically and converges after the task performance converges, showing a very smooth decrease. The contrastive f − loss decreases during training, which may account for success spikes prior to convergence. The method is able to converge after only a moderate decrease in the f + loss. This implies empirical evidence that the contrastive loss is an optimal critic for messaging. See figure 3.\n\nHeterogeneous Alignment Through Communication\n\nIn order to test the heterogeneous alignment ability of our methodology to learn higher-order concepts from highdimensional data, we analyze the performance on the Pascal VOC game. We compare our methodology against ae-comm to show that concepts should consist of independent information directly from task signal rather than compression to reconstruct inputs. That is, we show an empirical result on pixel data to verify the premise of the information bottleneck. Our methodology significantly outperforms the observation-grounded ae-comm baseline, as demonstrated by figure 4. The ae-comm methodology, despite using autoencoders to learn observation-grounded communication, performs only slightly better than no-comm. On the other hand, our methodology is able to outperform both baselines significantly. It is important to note that based on figure 4, our methodology is able to guess more than two of the four labels correctly across the two agents involved, while the baseline methodologies struggle to guess exactly two of thew four labels consistently. This can be attributed to our framework being able to learn compositional concepts that are much more easily discriminated due to mutual independence.",
      "Information-maximizing autoencoders aim to maximize the state reconstruction accuracy for each agent. How-ever, grounding communication in observations has been found to easily satisfy these input-based objectives while still requiring a myriad more samples to explore to find a task-specific communication space . Thus, it is necessary to use task-specific information to communicate informatively. This will enable learned compression for task completion rather than pure compression for input recovery. Other work aims to use the information bottleneck to decrease the entropy of messages . In our work, we use contrastive learning to increase representation similarity with future goals, which we show optimally optimizes the Q-function for messages. Natural Language Inspiration\n\nThe properties of the tokens in emergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token. Similar to word embeddings in natural language, discrete prototypes are an effort to cluster similar information together from continuous vectors . Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB , an information-theoretic observation grounding based on VQ-VAE properties , uses variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens. Like discrete prototypes, they exhibit a clustering property based on similar information but are more informative. However, each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent \"sentences\". Preliminaries\n\nWe formulate our setup as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). Formally, our problem is defined by the tuple, S, A, M, T , R, O, Ω, γ ."

However, they highly simplify the computational properties of neurons compared to their biological counterparts. Instead, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible models since spiking neurons encode information with time sequences of spikes, just like biological neurons do. However, there is a lack of studies on visual pathways with deep SNNs models. In this study, we model the visual cortex with deep SNNs for the first time, and also with a wide range of state-of-the-art deep CNNs and ViTs for comparison. Using three similarity metrics, we conduct neural representation similarity experiments on three neural datasets collected from two species under three types of stimuli. Based on extensive similarity analyses, we further investigate the functional hierarchy and mechanisms across species. Almost all similarity scores of SNNs are higher than their counterparts of CNNs with an average of 6.6%.",
      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background.",
      "However, deep SNNs have not been employed to model visual cortex due to the immaturity of training algorithms. Recently, a state-ofthe-art directly trained deep SNN , makes it possible to use deep SNNs as visual cortex models. Contributions. In this work, we conduct large-scale neural representation similarity experiments on SNNs and other high-performing deep neural networks to study the brain's visual processing mechanisms, with three datasets and three similarity metrics (Figure ). Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use deep SNNs to fit complex biological neural representations and explore the biological visual cortex. We summarize our main contributions in four points as follows. • We find that SNNs outperform their counterparts of CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures in almost all experiments. In addition, even with very different depths and architectures, SNNs can achieve top performance in most conditions. • By making a more direct comparison between macaques and mice for the first time, we reveal the differences in the visual pathways across the two species in terms of the homogeneity of visual regions and the increases of receptive field sizes across cortical visual pathways, which is consistent with previous physiological work. • The multi-branch structures in neural networks benefit neural representation similarity to mouse visual cortex, providing computational evidence that parallel information processing streams are widespread between cortical regions in the mouse visual system. • Comparing the results of two macaque neural datasets under different stimuli, we reveal that the macaque vision system may have functional specialization for processing human faces and other natural scenes. Altogether, as the first work to apply deep SNNs to fit neural representations, we shed light on visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice, demonstrating the potential of SNNs as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system.",
      "The neural responses are preprocessed to the form of average firing rate and can be downloaded from Brain-Score. Since the core visual function of macaque and mouse visual cortex is to recognize objects, the basic premise of model selection is that the model has good performance on object recognition tasks (e.g.\nclassification on ImageNet). Based on this premise, we employ 12 SNNs, 43 CNNs, and 26 vision transformers, all of which are pretrained on the Ima-geNet dataset and perform well in the classification task. As for SNNs, we use SEW ResNet as the base model, which is the deepest and SOTA directly trained SNN . Furthermore, by combining the residual block used in SEW ResNet and the hierarchy of the visual cortex, we build several new SNNs and train them on the ImageNet using SpikingJelly ) (see Appendix A for model structures and the details of model training). As for CNNs and vision transformers, we use 44 models from the Torchvision model zoo , 22 models from the Timm model zoo ) and 3 models from the brain-like CNNs, CORnet family ). In the feature extraction procedures of all models, we feed the same set of images used in biological experiments to the pretrained models and obtain features from all chosen layers. Different from CNNs and vision transformers, the features of SNNs are spikes in multiple time steps. To obtain the representation similarity between biological visual cortex and computational models, we apply three similarity metrics to computing similarity scores: representational similarity analysis (RSA) , regression-based encoding method and singular vector canonical correlation analysis (SVCCA) . RSA has already been widely used to analyze neural representations of a model and a brain to different stimuli at the population level, while the regression-based encoding method directly fits the model features to neural activity data. SVCCA is originally proposed to compare features of deep neural networks, and then Buice 2019) used it to compare representation matrices from mouse visual cortex and DNNs, which demonstrated its effectiveness."

      "Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability. Moreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive. Further experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.",
      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.",
      "We extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks. Reward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems. Additionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity. Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules . This observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems. Our results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments.",
      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
      "The theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed. Still, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing. Many different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms . The artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); . Additionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules."

      "In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together. Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire.:2–5 The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other. The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19 coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle. The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current.",
      "These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor. The solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED). The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.:457 A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract. The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.:35 The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances.",
      "Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh. A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals. The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points.",
      "Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator. By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation. The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires. Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.:23–24 One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass.",
      "He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment. In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.:11 If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.:206–07 Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.:223–25 These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised. The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion."

      "\\section{Introduction\\label{sct::intro}}\nSymmetric, public-key (asymmetric) and hash-based cryptography constitute a fundamental pillar of modern cryptography. Symmetric cryptography includes symmetric-key encryption, where a shared secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Cryptographic hash functions map arbitrarily long strings to strings of a fixed finite length. Currently deployed public-key schemes are\nused to establish a common secret key between two remote parties. They are based on factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem over a finite group. For more details about modern cryptography the interested reader can consult one of the many excellent references on the topic, e.g.~\\cite{Katz:2007:IMC:1206501}. In contrast to asymmetric schemes based on factoring or solving the discrete logarithm problem and which are completely broken by a quantum adversary via Shor's algorithm~\\cite{SJC.26.1484}, symmetric schemes and hash functions are less vulnerable to quantum attacks. The best known quantum attacks against them are based on Grover's quantum search algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.79.325}, which offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute force searching. Given a search space of size $N$, Grover's algorithm finds, with high probability, an element $x$ for which a certain property such as $f(x)=1$ holds, for some function $f$ we know how to evaluate (assuming such a solution exists). The algorithm evaluates $f$ a total of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ times. It applies a simple operation in between the evaluations of $f$, so the $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $f$ account for most of the complexity. In contrast, any classical algorithm that evaluates $f$ in a similar ``black-box'' way requires on the order of $N$ evaluations of $f$ to find such an element. Any quantum algorithm can be mapped to a quantum circuit, which can be implemented on a quantum computer. The quantum circuit represents what we call the ``logical layer\". Such a circuit can always be decomposed in a sequence of ``elementary \ngates\", such as Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard etc.~\\cite{NC00}) augmented by a non-Clifford gate such as the T gate.",
      "For example, very recently, there have been several cryptanalysis results~\\cite{1712.06239} and~\\cite{1802.03856} that attempt to reduce breaking some symmetric algorithms to solving a system of non-linear equations. Solving these non-linear equations is then attacked using a modified version of the quantum linear equation solver algorithm~\\cite{PhysRevLett.103.150502}. The results are heavily dependent on the condition number of the non-linear system, which turns to be hard to compute (it is not known for most ciphers and hash functions such as AES or SHA). Provided the condition number is relatively small, then one may get an  advantage compared to brute-force Grover search. However at this time it is not clear whether this is indeed the case, and we do not have large-scale quantum computers to experiment with. The quantum security parameter (based on our assumptions of using state-of-the-art algorithms and fault-tolerance methods) for symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes is summarized in Table~\\ref{tbl1}. For more details about space/time tradeoffs achievable via parallelization of Grover's algorithm please see the corresponding Sec.~\\ref{sct::ciphers}, Sec.~\\ref{sct::hash} and Sec.~\\ref{sct::bitcoin}, respectively. \\begin{table}[h!]\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\n\\hline\nName    & qs  \\\\\n\\hline\nAES-128 & 106 \\\\\nAES-192 & 139 \\\\\nAES-256 & 172 \\\\\n\\hline\nSHA-256 & 166 \\\\\nSHA3-256\t &167 \\\\\nBitcoin's PoW & 75\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Quantum security parameter ($qs$) for the AES family of ciphers, SHA family of hash functions, and Bitcoin, assuming a conservative physical error rate per gate $p_g=10^{-4}$.}\n\\label{tbl1}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe also analyzed the security of asymmetric (public-key) cryptography, in particular RSA and ECC, in the light of new improvements in fault-tolerant \nquantum error correction based on surface code lattice surgery techniques. We computed the space/time tradeoff required to attack \nevery scheme, using physical error rates of $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively.",
      "The temporal overhead (i.e. the number of surface code cycles) is reduced less drastically. For this reason, lattice surgery has less significant effects in estimating the security of symmetric schemes or hash functions, reducing the security parameter\\footnote{The security parameter is defined as the logarithm base two of the number of fundamental operations (in our case surface code cycles) required to break the scheme.} by at most 1 and decreasing the spatial overhead by at most a factor of 5. Therefore when estimating the security of symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes we use surface code defects and braiding techniques. For each cryptographic primitive, we display four plots, in the following order:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item We plot the total number of surface code cycles per CPU (where a CPU is a quantum computer capable of executing a single instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm) as a function of the number of CPUs. We directly tie the quantum security parameter to the total number of surface code cycles (see~\\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18} for more details). We also add to the plot the theoretical lower bound achievable by quantum search in the cases of: a) considering the oracle a black box of unit cost (lower line), and b) considering the oracle as composed of ideal quantum gates, each of unit cost (upper line). Note that the difference between b) and a) represents the intrinsic cost of logical overhead (i.e. the overhead introduced by treating the oracle as a logical circuit and not a blackbox), whereas the difference between the upper lines and b) represents the intrinsic cost introduced by the fault-tolerant layer. \\item We plot the total wall-time per CPU (i.e. how long will the whole computation take on a parallel quantum architecture) as a function of the number of CPUs. The horizontal dashed line represents the one-year time line, i.e. the $x$ coordinate of the intersection point between the ``Total time per CPU'' line and the one-year time line provides the number of processors required to break the system within one year (in $\\log_2$ units).",
      "We assume a surface code cycle time of 200ns, in conformance with~\\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}. For each scheme we analyze, we compare its security using the more conservative (and realistic in the short term) $p_g=10^{-3}$ and also the more optimistic  $p_g=10^{-5}$. Note that assuming the more optimistic assumption from a quantum computing perspective is the more conservative assumption from a cybersecurity perspective. Furthermore, in this analysis, we are reporting the full physical footprint, including the memory required for magic state distillation. Using present-day techniques, the memory required for generating these generic input states accounts for a substantial fraction of the total memory cost and thus we are including these in the total cost estimate and will track the impact of improved methods.\n\n\\section{Symmetric ciphers\\label{sct::ciphers}} Below we analyze the security of AES family of symmetric ciphers against large-scale fault-tolerant quantum adversaries. We used the highly optimized logical circuits produced in\n\\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-29360-8_3}. \\subsection{AES-128}\n\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.429\\textwidth]{figures/AES-128_cycles.pdf}\n      \t\\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher. Required surface clock cycles per processor, as a function of the  number of processors ($\\log_2$ scale). The bottom brown line (theoretical lower bound, black box) represents the minimal number of queries required\n\tby Grover's algorithm, the cost function being the total number of queries to a black-box oracle, each query assumed to have unit cost, and a completely error-free circuit. The purple line (ideal grover, non-black-box) takes into consideration the structure of the oracle, the cost function being the total number of gates in the circuit, each gate having unit cost; the quantum circuit is assumed error-free as well. Both brown and magenta lines are displayed only for comparisons; for both of them, the $y$ axis should be interpreted as number of logical queries (operations, respectively)."

      "If you have to play a gimmick offense, you might as well do it after facing a top 10 team. Maybe it will serve as a rally point after playing the 'Noles. Underrated talent\nLook at that depth chart again. It is not an all star lineup, but I think our front seven will be better than last year. I love some of the young DBs (Keyes, Asprilla) and think with a healthy Noel and improved ALJ, we can be solid defensively. I still think Chase Rettig can be great. I have real hope for Doug Martin and think our WR and TE talent is good enough. The biggest question is the offensive line. But as someone who has preached for a OL coaching change, I keep telling myself that Bollman will make a difference.\nEmotion and Pride\nFootball is an emotional game and emotional sport. Point fingers at whomever you like, but BC had awful team and coaching chemistry last season. When I see Al Washington posting on Facebook about his excitement, when I hear about the 5th year Seniors wanting to end their careers on a high note, when I look at the new field, I think that positive energy and emotion will carry us to an extra win or two. As long as these two (see pic below) stay out of the way and Spaz coaches to win, I think this might be a fun season. Is anyone else talking themselves into a big year?\nLabels: 2012, 2012 Preview, 2012 Schedule, Chase Rettig, Doug Martin, fire Spaz, Speculating with Spaz\nKey Players for 2012: Jim Noel\nSenior Safety, Jim Noel\nWhat he's been: A contributor since day one, Noel has grown from back up to fill in starter, to a full time starter over three years. While primarily a safety, BC has also used him at corner. He missed a good portion of 2011, leaving our already depleted secondary without an impact player. Noel has never been a big hitter or ballhawk, but he's been good in coverage and done what's been asked. What he needs to be: Noel needs to take over. Our defense is at its best when we have safeties with great anticipation. If you design your defense to exploit QB mistakes, you need a smart and athletic Safety to be in the right place at the right time.",
      "One of the reasons we struggled ending drives last year and giving up big plays to teams like Central Florida was because our safeties just couldn't make plays. Noel was doing his best filling in at Corner, while Syvlia, Hughes and Rositano kept getting burned. Hopefully Noel can focus on one area this year, stay healthy and have a big season. Why I like his chances to shine: Look back on the interceptions Noel has made. They are often really great athletic plays. Few are gimmes that just landed in his hand. If he can be that great for 12 games and get even a little help from his other safeties, he will have a big year. Last season BC only had 13 interceptions. It was our lowest output since the TOB years. If Noel can help end a few drives with big takeaways, BC could be a strong defensive team again. Labels: Jim Noel, Key Players, Preseason\nPrecamp Depth Chart and other links\nBC updated the depth chart in time for preseason camps to begin. This should be viewed as temporary and not who will start Labor Day weekend. There will be injuries and position switches that will alter things a bit. Hopefully no one is kicked off the team between now and the start of the season. Florida DB Matt Milano committed to BC over the weekend. Milano also had offers from Arizona and Air Force. Andy Katz listed BC among the possible destinations for BU transfer Jake O'Brien. Rumor is Providence is his most likely destination. I hope he gives BC a long look. He'd be another no risk big man for Donahue and give us some nice depth. Labels: Jake O'Brien, Links, Matt Milano\nCoaches to Watch this fall Part 4: Current Offensive Coordinators\nSince everyone has Spaz on the Hotseat List, now is as good a time as any to look at future BC head coaching candidates. Unlike our past profile series, the timing and style on these posts will be a little different. Instead of being weeks or days away from a potential change, we have the benefit of a whole season to evaluate these guys. Some stocks will rise, while others will fall and it will make our usual scoreboard watching that much more interesting.",
      "That he would some how save the Spaz era from its offensive funk and lead BC to unexpected glory. Instead, he's been mediocre. He completed just over half of his passes last year and never put together back-to-back great games nor enough sustained drives. Apologists for Rettig like me blame the system, the talent around him and of course the way his Spaz has screwed up the offense. But even the biggest Rettig cheerleaders have to admit he's yet to have a memorable BC moment or done anything to get on an NFL radar. What he needs to be: Someone who can put the team on his back. I know the offensive line has been terrible, leaving Chase running for his life. I know plenty of passes have been dropped and no one is making big plays. But a truly great QB would show more by now. He's started 21 games. He's finally is a simplified offense that will get the ball out of his hands. If Chase does have an accurate arm, if he is as cerebral as people say, if he can get off throws in a collapsing pocket, now is his chance to show it. Why I like his chances to shine: I don't know if Doug Martin is going to be a miracle worker, but QB's can make huge leaps with a new offense. Just look at Dominique Davis. He went to East Carolina and became one of the most accurate passers in the country. Last year I thought Rettig would be great. I thought his toughness and preparation would overcome the offensive limitations. Here I am a year late thinking the same thing. But the difference is Doug Martin. We finally have an experienced OC running a current, simple offense. Rettig will be asked to make quick decisions and get the ball out fast. I think he can do it. I also think that throwing 400+ passes will give him a rhythm and a confidence that he's never had at BC. Labels: 2012 Preview, Chase Rettig, Doug Martin, Key Players, Season Previews\nRich Thompson will cover BC football this Fall for the Herald\nThere is some news on the BC media front. The Herald assigned Rich Thompson to the BC beat for this Fall's football season.",
      "When he first arrived, Jags said that he could be the next Costanzo. Tall and lean (for a lineman) Cleary's been a consistent contributor like Costanzo (playing in 36 games and starting 26) yet he's never been the consistently great like Costanzo. How much of Cleary's occasional mistakes or setback are due to talent, coaching or the offense? I think it's been a bit of everything. What he needs to be: Good isn't good enough anymore. Cleary takes on the big responsibility of left tackle this year. Rettig has been running for his life the past three years. If the offense is ever going to take off, they need to improve pass protection. That will start with Cleary. And in the ACC, he'll be facing some of the top defensive linemen in the country on a weekly basis. Cleary's always been good with speed guys on the edge. He'll also need to improve on run blocking. If Martin uses more stretches and zones like Logan, that will leave Cleary often sealing off edges on run plays. Why I like his chances to shine: We've seen offensive lineman make huge leaps from season to season before. Part of it is maturing into their bodies and understanding the position. But a lot is coaching. I think Cleary has been underserved in that department. Even if Bollman is not some OL guru, I think Cleary playing in a more pass happy, up tempo offense will play to his strengths. I think his leadership position and the coaching staff's confidence in him will make him shine at LT. I think he will live up to his potential and have multiple games where he dominates and plays mistake free football. Plus he still has the NFL on his horizon. If he can perform at an elite level, he can jump up from a late round afterthought to a high-round pick. I think if Cleary stays healthy, he shoot up draft boards. If BC's offense breaks out of its doldrums he'll be named an all conference player. Labels: 2012 Preview, emmett cleary, Jim Bollman, Key Players\nBC using coordinators as face(s) of the program?

      "In order to find out if $f\\left(x\\right)$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$, we suggest to follow a list of steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Check if the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ itself is defined at the point $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is undefined at $x_{0}$, then it is not differentiable at $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined at $x_{0}$, then proceed to next step. \\item Identify the basic functions that are used in the formula of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$, that are themselves defined at the point $x_{0}$, but their derivative is not (such as, for example, the root functions). \\item Find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ at the point $x_{0}$ using definition. \\end{enumerate}\n\nThe importance of the first step comes from the fact that most students tend to pay little attention to the functions domain analysis when asked to investigate its derivative. Formally, the second step can be skipped, however it will give the students the insight into which part of the function presents a problem and teach them to identify similar cases in the future. the difficulty of accomplishing the third step depends on the form of the function and sometimes can be tedious. Nevertheless, it allows the students to apply the previously obtained skills and encourages the review of the material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{cos.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe discussed the misconception, that the expression of the derivative of the function contains the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points, where the expression is undefined. We considered a typical Calculus problem of looking for the horizontal tangent line of a function as an example. We showed how the search for the values that make the expression of the derivative equal zero leads to missing a solution: even though the expression of the derivative is undefined, the function still possesses the derivative at the point.",
      "x \\neq 0 \\\\ \n0, & \\mbox{if } x = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe expression for the derivative of the function provides the correct value of the derivative only for those values of the independent variable, for which the expression is defined; it does not tell anything about the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. Indeed, let us consider the function\n\\begin{equation*}\ng\\left(x\\right) = {\\sqrt[3]{x}}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\n\\end{equation*}\nand its derivative $g'\\left(x\\right)$ \n\\begin{equation*}\ng'\\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}-6x^2\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the expression for the derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Nonetheless, it can be shown that $g\\left(x\\right)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:GFunction}). Therefore, we provided two visually similar functions: both have the expressions for their derivatives undefined in zero, however, one of these functions possesses a derivative, but the other one does not.\n\n\\section{Methodological Remarks} Unfortunately, there exist many functions similar to the ones discussed above and they can arise in a variety of typical Calculus problems: finding the points where the tangent line is horizontal, finding an equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the given point, the use of differentials and graph sketching. Relying only on the expression of the derivative for determining its value at the undefined points may lead to missing a solution (as in the example discussed above) or to some completely false interpretations (as in the case of curve sketching). As it was discussed above, the expression for the derivative does not provide any information on the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression itself is undefined. Here we present a methodology for the analysis of this type of functions. Let $f\\left(x\\right)$ be the function of interest and $f'\\left(x\\right)$ be the expression of its derivative undefined at some point $x_{0}$.",
      "First, note that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined in $x=0$. In order to verify if it has a horizontal tangent at this point, let us find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ using definition:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(0\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(0+h\\right)-f\\left(0\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{h}\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{h} \\cdot {h} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}\\right)} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{h} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nsince each of the limits above exists. We see that, indeed, the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ possesses a horizontal tangent line at the point $x=0$.\n\n\\section{Closer Look at the Expression for the Derivative}\n\nWhat is the problem with the standard procedure proposed by many textbooks and repeated in every Calculus class? The explanation lies in the following premise: the expression of the derivative of the function does not contain the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points where it is undefined. As it is pointed out in \\cite{Rivera2013}, the domain of the derivative is determined \\emph{a priori} and therefore should not be obtained from the formula of the derivative itself. In the example above the Product Law for derivatives requires the existence of the derivatives of both functions at the point of interest. Since the function $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is not differentiable in zero, the Product Rule cannot be applied. In order to see what exactly happens when we apply the Product Rule, let us find the expression for the derivative using definition of the derivative:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(x+h\\right)-f\\left(x\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)}{h}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} + \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)}{h}\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} +  \\notag \\\\&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\cdot \\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich seems to be identical to the expression (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}).",

      "Synapses form rapidly, efficiently and selectively in this system, and are easily accessible for quantification. Our results indicate that various GABAAR subtypes differ in their ability to promote synapse formation, suggesting that this reduced in vitro model system can be used to reproduce, at least in part, the in vivo conditions required for the recognition of the appropriate synaptic partners and formation of specific synapses. Here the protocols for culturing the medium spiny neurons and generating HEK293 cells lines expressing GABAARs are first described, followed by detailed instructions on how to combine these two cell types in co-culture and analyze the formation of synaptic contacts.

Institutions: University of California, Santa Cruz. In the mammalian cortex, neurons form extremely complicated networks and exchange information at synapses. Changes in synaptic strength, as well as addition/removal of synapses, occur in an experience-dependent manner, providing the structural foundation of neuronal plasticity. As postsynaptic components of the most excitatory synapses in the cortex, dendritic spines are considered to be a good proxy of synapses. Taking advantages of mouse genetics and fluorescent labeling techniques, individual neurons and their synaptic structures can be labeled in the intact brain. Here we introduce a transcranial imaging protocol using two-photon laser scanning microscopy to follow fluorescently labeled postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in vivo. This protocol utilizes a thinned-skull preparation, which keeps the skull intact and avoids inflammatory effects caused by exposure of the meninges and the cortex. Therefore, images can be acquired immediately after surgery is performed.",
      "Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping provided specific hardware and methodological criteria are followed. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices and stable micromanipulation allowing independent attainment of pre- and postsynaptic whole cell recordings. While CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell pairs are most widely used in the organotypic slice hippocampal preparation, this technique has also been successful in CA3-CA1 pairs and can be adapted to any neurons that are synaptically connected in the same slice preparation. In this manuscript we provide the detailed methodology and requirements for establishing this technique in any laboratory equipped for electrophysiology.

Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles. Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia.",

Mathis, Jennifer L. Furman, Christopher M. Norris. Institutions: University of Kentucky College of Public Health, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine. The rodent hippocampal slice preparation is perhaps the most broadly used tool for investigating mammalian synaptic function and plasticity. The hippocampus can be extracted quickly and easily from rats and mice and slices remain viable for hours in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, basic electrophysisologic techniques are easily applied to the investigation of synaptic function in hippocampal slices and have provided some of the best biomarkers for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity.",
      "The axons and dendrites of the post-mitotic neurons are sheered off near the soma during dissociation but the neurons begin to regenerate processes within a few hours of plating. Images show live cultures at 2 days. Neurons continue to elaborate processes during the first week in culture. Specific neuronal populations can be identified in culture using GAL4 lines to drive tissue specific expression of fluorescent markers such as GFP or RFP. Whole cell recordings have demonstrated the cultured neurons form functional, spontaneously active cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. A short video segment illustrates calcium dynamics in the cultured neurons using Fura-2 as a calcium indicator dye to monitor spontaneous calcium transients and nicotine evoked calcium responses in a dish of cultured neurons. These pupal brain cultures are a useful model system in which genetic and pharmacological tools can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence formation and function of central synapses."

Refusing to take part in the tender, Russian Rosoboronexport said it wanted a fresh design and development project. Antonov of Ukraine wanted yet another extension of the bid submission deadline due to the ongoing conflict in Crimea. Swedish Saab said it had shut down its assembly line for such aircraft. Then, Alenia Aermacchi was linked to Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, which has been slapped with \"a partial ban\" after the infamous VVIP helicopter scandal. \"All this left only the European consortium Airbus. The DAC will have to take a call since re-tendering may lead to the same situation,\" said the source. Incidentally, it was the Modi government's first DAC in July -- then headed by Arun Jaitley - which revived the Avro replacement project after it was put on hold by the UPA-2 regime last year due to strong opposition from the powerful PSU lobby and ministers like Praful Patel, as reported by TOI earlier. Apart from the critical need to encourage the private sector to enter defence production in a big way, especially in the aerospace arena where Hindustan Aeronautics enjoys a monopoly, its felt the defence PSU's order books are already overflowing with projects.

This particular model hardly sold much and was developed for ultra-long range flights.. it was the least successful 777 model and clearly AI goofed up on the configuration by going for these in place of the 300ER.

Though the defence acquisitions council (DAC) chaired by Manohar Parrikar will take the final decision, MoD sources on Tuesday said the \"emerging dominant view\" is that green signal should be given to the crucial project designed to promote Indian private sector's entry into the domestic aerospace arena with foreign collaboration. \"The Tata-Airbus technical and commercial bid is a credible offer submitted in a competitive environment. The other seven contenders backed out for one reason or the other,\" said a source. IAF has now sought the clearance of the DAC -- the first such meeting to be chaired by Parrikar after becoming defence minister on November 10 -- to begin technical evaluation of the C-295 aircraft offered by Airbus Defence & Space and Tata Advanced Systems.

FlightGlobal- Boeing sitting on 8 unsold C-17s\nBy: Dan ParsonsWashington DCSource: Flightglobal.com\nThis story is sourced from Flightglobal.com 12 hours agoBoeing has sold two more C-17 transports to an undisclosed customer, but it will likely end the year with eight unsold white tails. There are 10 Boeing C-17 airlifters in various stages of assembly at the company’s Long Beach, California, production facility. Two of the aircraft are spoken for by an unnamed customer, Boeing says. Boeing is trying to sell off the other eight white tails, which will be the last produced before the factory is shuttered sometime in the summer of 2015. The 279th – and final – C-17 fuselage will be mated to its wings in January or February, programme spokeswoman Tiffany Pitts tells Flightglobal. The operation is California’s last remaining aircraft production line and the lone widebody military aircraft production line in the USA, according to Boeing. At least two countries – Australia and Canada – have publicly announced an intention to purchase a C-17, though neither factor into Boeing’s future planning, Pitts says. Until contracts are finalised, the number available remains eight, she says. The Royal Canadian Air Force already has four C-17As, according to Flightglobal’s World Air Forces 2014 directory. Canadian news outlets reported earlier in December that the air force would buy one C-17 with money left over at the end of 2015."

      "For example, the category identifier 374 identifies sports cars as a channel category because it is an explicit interest of the user. The category identifier 374 suggests channels including a source, a category, keywords, a media type, a size of a content item, and a location for a channel. For example, for a user that is interested in foreign politics, especially relations between the United States and China, the category identifier 374 suggests the category of U.S. and Chinese relations (e.g., entity=“us_china_relations”), keywords such as trade and deficit because the user is particularly interested in the economic aspect of the relationship between China and the United States, a source such as The Economist (source=“economist.com”) because the user prefers The Economist over U.S. media outlets and the media being news articles because the user does not enjoy viewing videos. In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses the analyses of the historical analyzer 374 for identifying a channel category for the user. This is advantageous as a user who has searched for US taxes might not be interested in knowing about it throughout the year, but it is beneficial for the user to have a separate channel for US taxes during the tax filing season. In yet another embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses contextual cues of the user for identifying channel categories. For example, the category identifier 374 identifies skiing in Switzerland as a channel category because winter sports is listed as an interest of the user and the user's current IP address is in Switzerland. The subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to existing channels that are public. In one embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to a pre-defined channel (such as breaking news, most popular videos, updates from a social group, etc.). The channel application 103 generates the stream of content for pre-defined channels based on global scores of the new content items. Subscribing to pre-defined channels such as breaking news is advantageous as it helps the user to keep apprised of current information and discover new interests.",
      "Furthermore, because in one embodiment the breaking news channel is personalized since the content items are compared to a model for the user, the breaking news channel is more relevant than simply a list of popular or recent news items. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to another user's channel (a friend, a famous person, etc.) that is public. Subscribing to another user's channel is advantageous because, for example, a user who is interested in the stock market will benefit by viewing the stream of content that is viewed by a famous stock market analyst. In yet another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables the user to search for channels that are public using the search engine 143. The subscription module 376, suggests such channels that are viewed by other users based on the interests of the user. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 communicates with the collaborative filtering engine 217 to suggest channels viewed by other users with whom the user has a relationship. The channel generator 378 submits a request for a stream of content for a channel to the scoring engine 211. The request includes the channel category identified by the category identifier 374 and channel attributes. The channel attributes include any attribute known to a person with ordinary skill in the art such as a source, presence of keywords, absence of keywords, a media type, a location, a time, a size of a content item, a date, etc. In one embodiment, the channel category and the channel attributes are defined by the user. In another embodiment, channel generator 378 defines the channel attributes for the channel category based on the user's preferences and activities. For example, if a user always reads news articles and seldom watches news videos, the channel generator 378 would define the media type for the channel as text based articles.

      "A system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel. The channel application includes a content categorizer, a scoring engine and a channel engine. The content categorizer categorizes new content items received from heterogeneous data sources. The channel engine identifies a channel category for a user based at least in part on at least one of a historical trend and a user activity. The scoring engine queries the new content items based on the channel category and at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine retrieves candidate content items that include the channel category and the other channel attribute. The scoring engine then generates a stream of content from the candidate content items for the channel. This application claims priority under 35 USC §120 to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/225,209, entitled, “Generating a Stream of Content for a Channel,” filed on Sep. 2, 2011, and claims priority under 35 USC §119(e) to U.S. Application No. 61/424,636, entitled “Scoring Stream Items with Models Based on User Interests” filed Dec. 18, 2010, the entireties of which are herein incorporated by reference. The specification relates to a system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel. In particular, the specification relates to generating a stream of content for a channel based on user interests and historical trends. Many consumers of digital media have two somewhat contradictory goals: keep apprised of information in the areas they already find interesting and discover new content that is also enjoyable. Keeping apprised of information can become burdensome in the digital age because there is so much information. Hence, there is a need to present the best and most relevant information, without overwhelming the consumer. Furthermore, consumers have varied interests depending on the time of a year or a day. As a result, there is also a need to cater to the time dependent changes in the consumer's interests while presenting information. Similarly, discovering new content is difficult when the consumer is overburdened with existing content.",
      "The scoring server 262 then compares the candidate content items to the model and scores the candidate content items. The scoring engine 211 compares the candidate content items received from the social network server 101 to the model and rescores them according to the model. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 scores the candidate content items according to the category and any keywords associated with a channel. In either embodiment, the scoring engine 211 generates a stream of content based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content to the channel application 103. Referring now to FIG. 3A, one embodiment of a channel engine 240 is shown in more detail. The channel engine 240 includes a historical analyzer 372, a category identifier 374, a subscription module 376 and a channel generator 378 that are each coupled to signal line 230. The historical analyzer 372 is used to identify when a user will be interested in a particular category. The historical analyzer 372 identifies, for example, a time of the day or a year that a user will be interested in a category by analyzing historical trends associated with the category. In one embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 performs such analyses by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of new content items that are categorized under a content category or by measuring an increase or decrease in the number of times a new content item is accessed. For example, the number of times a tutorial on filing taxes is accessed would be very high during February-April. In another embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 also keeps track of events such as holidays, festivals, etc. Tracking such events is advantageous as, for example, many users might be interested in costume rentals during Halloween or camping during the Memorial Day and July 4th weekends. The category identifier 374 identifies a channel category for a user based on the user's interests, activities and social connections. In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 requests the model generated by the model generation engine 207 to identify the channel category.",

The channel category is defined based on a model for a user that is generated by the model generation engine 207 or the channel is defined by a user. The scoring engine 211 receives 604 the request including the channel category and generates 606 a stream of content based on the channel category. The channel engine 240 generates 608 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user. FIG. 7 is a flow diagram 700 of another embodiment of a method for generating a stream of content for a channel. The content categorizer 250 categorizes 702 new content items that are received from heterogeneous data sources. The new content items that are received from heterogeneous data sources include, for example, news articles, microblogs, blogs, videos, photos, etc. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the content according to a category and other features. The content categorizer 250 also stores 704 the new content items in a data storage server 265 or a memory 237, depending upon the embodiment. The global scorer 302 generates 706 a global score for each new content item.

Secondly, we all assume that these \"sense impressions\" are the result of something 'real' out-there.

We all assume these \"sense impressions\" are the automatic reaction/response from some 'real' stimuli.

Fourthly, if the body auto-responds in a particular way then the likelihood of survivability is enhanced, and if the response is otherwise then it may be diminished. Neri wrote: To keep ourselves safe, it is necessary that we have the ability to know when a material object is moving closer or further from us and to be able to recognize an object as a danger. Not so. It is NOT the \"knowing\" or \"recognizing\" of the dangerous moving object that \"keep ourselves safe\". It is the body's automatic reaction/response to this moving object (stimuli) that \"keep ourselves safe\". Remember, we can only be conscious of (i.e. know or recognize) actual bodily reactions/events, and not of other 'external' events. We don't consciously know/recognize how we responded until 'after' we (our body) responds. Our consciousness (knowing/recognizing) is wholly dependent upon our bodily reactions/responses, ...NOT the other way around. Without something (e.g. sense impressions; bodily reactions) to be conscious of, then there is no consciousness (...no knowing or recognizing!).

      "Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society. Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‘ad (رعد) applied to the electric ray. Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.",
      "The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially. The first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes.",
      "Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers. With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster. The people who keep it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb’s song \"Wichita Lineman\" (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.

      "Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector. The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate. Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process. The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership."

      "At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i ∼ U (0, 1)). The value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU. After outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + ξ, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and ξ is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system ξ ∼ N (0, σ). Figure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix. For the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here. As a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.",
      "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume. To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value. While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",

      "As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features. On the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,\nquantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches. To analyze the effects of $\\GS{1}\\neq\\GS{2}$, we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x$ and extend\nthe definition of $\\GS{}$,\n\\beq\nx = \\frac{\\GS{1}-\\GS{2}}{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}, \\quad \\GS{} = \\frac{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}{2}. \\label{xGS}\n \\end{equation} \nNote, that even for a fixed $\\GS{}$, the actual CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}=\\GS{}\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ decreases\nwith increasing $|x|$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point\nvisible in \\figs{x}(a) and (b). To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to \\emph{both} exchange\nmechanisms were calculated using $x$-dependent $t=\\GS{\\rm X}$ instead of $t=\\xi/\\sqrt{2}$. \nTherefore, $\\xi$ was generalized for $x\\neq 0$ by setting $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2(1-x^2)^{-1}+\\GS{}^2}$.\nClearly, in \\fig{x}(b) the curves for different exchange mechanisms are very similar and differ mainly \nby a constant factor, resulting from different influence of $U'$; see \\Sec{scales}. The magnitude of $T^*$ changes is quite large, exceeding an order of magnitude for $x=\\pm 0.5$ \nand $\\xi=U/20$. Moreover, $T^* \\to 0$ for $x\\to\\pm 1$. Consequently, for strongly asymmetric\ndevices one cannot hope to observe the second stage of Kondo screening. A careful observer can note that the $T^*(x)$ dependency is not symmetrical; note for example different \n$T^*$ for $x=\\pm 0.5$ in \\fig{x}(a). This is caused by the dependence of the first stage Kondo temperature\n$T_K$ on $\\GS{1}$ \\cite{part1,DomanskiIW},\n\\beq\n\\widetilde{T}_K(\\GS{1}) = T_K \\cdot \\exp\\!\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{\\Gamma U}\\right). \\end{equation} \nHere, $T_K$ is, as earlier, defined in the absence of SC, while $\\widetilde{T}_K$ is a function \nof $\\GS{1}$, such that $G(\\widetilde{T}_K) = G_{\\rm max}(\\GS{1})/2$ in the absence of QD2."

      "Such equipment had been tried out on the seabed earlier, but on a limited scale and not in the deep and rough waters found on Ekofisk. This challenge was overcome by having the wellheads manufactured and then reinforced at the Phillips base in Dusavik outside Stavanger. Flowlines and control cables would also be laid from each well to Gulftide, with production comingled in a single riser to the topsides. Weather conditions also represented a major problem when designing the loading buoys. Phillips itself had experience with such facilities, but the concept had only been used before in harbour-like conditions and waters no deeper than 27 metres. They were now to stand in 70 metres in the middle of the North Sea. Gulftide was converted in the Åmøy Fjord outside Stavanger to cope with conditions on Ekofisk. The processing facilities were installed and reinforcements made to the derrick, helideck, hangar and leg structures.

Verksted/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nPlanning began in late 1970, when Phillips received approval to begin laying the flowlines between wellheads and rig. Brown & Root won this contract, with the first oil pipelines on the Norwegian continental shelf laid by the Hugh W Gordon laybarge. The production principle on Gulftide was relatively simple. Output flowed from the subsea wellheads to the rig, where it passed through two separation levels to be split into oil and gas while the huge pressure was reduced. Gas was flared off and the oil was piped to one of the loading buoys where a shuttle tanker was moored. Production could only take place when a ship was present.

      "utbyggingen,\nTankskipet Donovania laster olje fra lastebøyen på Ekofisk. I bakgrunnen skimtes så vidt Gulftide. Foto: ConocoPhillips/Norsk Oljemuseum\nProduction could only continue while ships were loading. As soon as one tanker had been filled, the oil stream was diverted to the vessel waiting at the other loading buoy. The problem with this approach was manifested when weather conditions ­– strong winds and/or high waves – forced the tankers to leave the buoys. If that happened, production from the wellheads had to be suspended immediately. Given the prevailing weather on Ekofisk, that happened regularly. Output was halted for 20 per cent of the time during the first year. https://ekofisk.industriminne.no/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Building-Ekofisk.mp4\nGulftide was replaced as the temporary production installation in 1974 by the permanent Ekofisk 2/4 A (Alpha) and 2/4 B (Bravo) platforms for production, drilling and quarters. In addition came the Ekofisk 2/4 C (Charlie) production, drilling and compression facility, the Ekofisk 2/4 FTP (field terminal platform) for production and risers, and Ekofisk 2/4 Q for accommodation. Oil and gas were produced by 2/4 A, B and C through their own wells for processing in their separation plants and piping on the 2/4 FTP for a three-stage separation process. At the same time, the tanker loading buoys were moved further from the platforms and the Ekofisk 2/4 T oil storage tank became operational. This facility was extremely advantageous, because it allowed production to continue virtually regardless of whether bad weather prevented tankers from connecting to the buoys. Ekofisktanken ble satt i drift i 1974. Foto: ConocoPhillips/Norsk Oljemuseum\nThe 2/4 FTP platform, where oil and gas from the three producing facilities was processed, had been planned to handle the level of output estimated for the main field. Clear restrictions had been imposed by the Norwegian government on the amount of gas Phillips was allowed to flare. That also set a ceiling for oil production, since gas accompanies it up from the reservoir.",
      "The problem with this approach arose when weather conditions meant the tankers had to cast off from the buoys because of strong winds or high waves. The rig then had to shut down production from the wellheads immediately. Given the weather conditions found on Ekofisk, output regularly had to cease. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason. Output began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day.

From there, the gas then travelled the next third of the distance to the second and virtually identical compressor platform, H7. This was also responsible for maintaining pressure, but additional compression was seldom required on this final leg of the journey to Emden. Both platforms stood on the German continental shelf, but 48 kilometres of the pipeline also ran across the Danish North Sea sector. The pipeline is trenched or covered with sand. On its final approach to the coast of East Friesland, it passes beneath the island of Juist before making landfall north of Emden.

      "Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy. Revolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy. The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier. Later service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy.",
      "He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College. Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship . When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940. World War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942. By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best. During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.",
      "Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner. He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator. Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King. In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937.",
      "He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS). While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953. Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955. On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States."

We computed the security parameter, wall-time and physical footprint for each cryptographic primitive. Our attack model was based on a brute force searching via a parallelized version of Grover's algorithm, assuming a surface-code fault-tolerant architecture based on defects and braiding techniques. It is worth noting that throughout we are assuming that brute-force search where we treat the cryptographic function as a black-box is essentially the optimal attack against SHA and AES, which is currently believed to be the case. Some symmetric key algorithms are susceptible in a model that permits ``superposition attacks''~\\cite{quantph.1602.05973}. In most realistic instances, these attacks are not practical, however they do shed light on the limitations of certain security proof methods in a quantum context, and remind us that we shouldn't take for granted that non-trivial attacks on symmetric key cryptography may be possible."

      "For Allen Brain mouse dataset, there are significant negative correlations between the similarity scores and the number of parameters for three metrics while there is no correlation with the depth. Conversely, for the two macaque neural datasets, the similarity scores are highly correlated with the depth of networks, but not with the number of parameters. Specifically, there is a positive correlation for Macaque-Face dataset while a negative correlation for Macaque-Synthetic dataset. (We also apply the linear regression to analyze the correlation between the similarity scores and the model size. The results are consistent with Spearman's rank correlation and are shown in Appendix E). Based on these results, we further investigate more detailed properties of neural networks to explain the processing mechanisms in the visual cortex. For the mouse dataset, on the one hand, the best layer depths show non-significant changes across the mouse cortical regions as mentioned in the previous section. On the other hand, the similarity scores of the mouse dataset are only correlated with the number of model parameters but not with the depth of models. It calls into the question whether any detailed structures in the neural networks help to reduce the number of parameters and improve its similarity to mouse visual cortex. Therefore, we explore the commonalities between models that have the top 20% representation similarities (see Appendix D) for Allen Brain dataset. As expected, the top models contain similar structures, such as fire module, inception module, and depthwise separable convolution. All these structures essentially process information through multiple branches/channels and then integrate the features from each branch. The models with this type of structure outperform other models (t = 2.411, p = 0.024; t = 3.030, p = 0.007; t = 1.174, p = 0.247). Moreover, we apply the depthwise separable convolution to SNNs, which yields a positive effect. The representation similarity of Spiking-MobileNet is higher than SEW-ResNet50 with a similar depth (+0.8%; +3.9%; +12.1%).",

However, they highly simplify the computational properties of neurons compared to their biological counterparts. Instead, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible models since spiking neurons encode information with time sequences of spikes, just like biological neurons do. However, there is a lack of studies on visual pathways with deep SNNs models. In this study, we model the visual cortex with deep SNNs for the first time, and also with a wide range of state-of-the-art deep CNNs and ViTs for comparison. Using three similarity metrics, we conduct neural representation similarity experiments on three neural datasets collected from two species under three types of stimuli. Based on extensive similarity analyses, we further investigate the functional hierarchy and mechanisms across species. Almost all similarity scores of SNNs are higher than their counterparts of CNNs with an average of 6.6%.",
      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background.",
      "To figure out the distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice, for each cortical region, we obtain the normalized depth of the layer that achieves the highest similarity score in each model. Then, we divide models (excluding vision transformers) into two groups based on their depths and conduct investigations on these two groups separately. A nonparametric ANOVA is applied to each group for testing whether layer depths change significantly across cortical regions. For mouse visual cortex (Figure (a)), taking the deep model group as an example, ANOVA shows overall significant changes in depth across cortical regions for TSVD-Reg and RSA (Friedman's χ 2 = 49.169,\np = 2.0 × 10 −9 ; χ 2 = 19.455, p = 0.002). But there is no significant change for SVCCA (χ 2 = 8.689, p = 0.122). According to these results, the differences in depth across regions are indeterminacy and irregular. Meanwhile, the trends of layer depth between some regions contradict the hierarchy observed in physiological experiments of mice (those between VISp and VISrl for TSVD-Reg and between VISal and VISpm for RSA). However, for macaque visual cortex (Figure (b)), there are significant differences (t = −5.451, p = 6.5 × 10 −6 ; t = −8.312, p = 2.8 × 10 −9 ; t = −3.782, p = 6.9 × 10 −4 , also taking the deep model group as an example) between V4 and IT, and the trend is consistent with the information processing hierarchy in primate visual cortex. The comparative analyses of the best layer depths of the shallow and deep model groups also exhibit the differences between macaques and mice. For mouse visual cortex, the best layer depths of shallow models are significantly higher than those of deep models. Compared to deep models, most shallow models achieve the top similarity scores in intermediate and even later layers. Differently, for macaque visual cortex, the depth of models has little effect on the depth of the most similar layer. What's more, we find that the most similar layer of mouse visual cortex always occurs after the 28 × 28 feature map is downsampled to 14 × 14, which leads to the layer depths' difference between shallow and deep models."

      "The modernisation is being conducted at the VVS's Military Transport Aviation (MTA) maintenance facility based at the Ilyushin division in Zhukovsky city near Moscow. A senior Ilyushin official told IHS Jane's that the upgrade of the first aircraft will be finished in 18 months. Subsequent aircraft will take less time to complete the process, however. When the modernisation is finished the initial Il-76MDM will undergo state trials. The upgrade process for subsequent aircraft will begin when the trials programme is completed. IHS Jane's was previously told by a VVS senior official that the modernisation of 41 MTA Il-76MDs is planned by 2020. While the Il-76MDM upgrade retains the old D-30KP engine (compared with the PS-90A engine equipping the new Il-76MD-90A/Il-476), the modernisation effort should match the aircraft's onboard electronics with those of the newbuild Il-76MD-90A. This and other efforts mean the cost of modernising the Il-76MD to Il-76MDM is only a third of that of a newbuild Il-76MD-90A.\nThe existing D-30KP engines are to be enhanced to increase their service life. The overall aircraft's service life will be extended by 15 years. The upgrade works are planned to be conducted in an aviation repair factory or in the MTA's aircraft maintenance facility. As a result, the Ulyanovsk-based Aviastar-SP plant, which is building the Il-76MD-90A, is not involved in the Il-76MD to Il-76MDM modernisation programme.

      "The cost of the $600 million project is being equally shared by the two countries. The MTA, when developed, will have ready market for 205 aircraft - 45 for the Indian Air Force, 100 for the Russian Air Force, and 60 more for exporting to friendly countries. The international market for MTA is estimated at 390 planes. Under the agreement, thirty percent of the annual production of planes could be exported to third countries. The MTA was expected to go in service with the Russian and Indian Air Forces in 2015. But the project faced a number of problems, delaying the development of the MTA. The project got into rough weather after India felt there was nothing much for Indian engineers and scientists to do in the design and development of the MTA. However, all the issues related to the project were resolved with the Russians when the HAL undertook to carry out design and development of its work-share of MTA at Aircraft R&D Centre at Bangalore. Russian Ilyushin Design Bureau and the Irkut Corporation and HAL are participating in the project. The first flight is expected to take place in 2017-18. The MTA would replace the AN- 32 aircraft being used by the IAF. It will be used for both cargo and troop transportation, para-drop and air drop of supplies, including low-altitude parachute extraction system. BrahMos missile exports a challenging proposition\nAnother key deal expected to be signed during the summit, is for the development of “BrahMos mini missile” by the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace which manufactures supersonic cruise missile. BrahMos’ new CEO Sudhir Mishra recently said he was hopeful that a deal to develop the mini version of the missile will be signed during Putin’s summit with Modi. “We are hoping to sign a tripartite agreement between DRDO, NPOM lab and BrahMos Aerospace during the planned visit of Russian President in December,” Mishra said. He said that the new missile will have a speed of 3.5 mach and carry a payload of 300 km up to a range of 290 km. In size, it will be about half of the present missile, which is around 10 metres long.",
      "But, I can't see how the first prototype can to take to the sky before 2019(more than 10 years since MTAL was formed)! If the transport plane materializes, then one can imagine making a civilian 150-200 seater version of the same. Though I think that we should participate in Russian MS-21 and also the wide body follow on. But this program needs a push. Will Putin's visit be able to galvanize this into the next symbol of Indo-Russian cooperation. Probably not! Absence of any specifics on Sukhoi Superjet, MS-21, Wide body aircraft, Mi-38, MRTA, FGFA, even after Putin visit is very disappointing. FlightGlobal- Boeing sitting on 8 unsold C-17s\nBy: Dan ParsonsWashington DCSource: Flightglobal.com\nThis story is sourced from Flightglobal.com 12 hours agoBoeing has sold two more C-17 transports to an undisclosed customer, but it will likely end the year with eight unsold white tails. There are 10 Boeing C-17 airlifters in various stages of assembly at the company’s Long Beach, California, production facility. Two of the aircraft are spoken for by an unnamed customer, Boeing says. Boeing is trying to sell off the other eight white tails, which will be the last produced before the factory is shuttered sometime in the summer of 2015. The 279th – and final – C-17 fuselage will be mated to its wings in January or February, programme spokeswoman Tiffany Pitts tells Flightglobal. The operation is California’s last remaining aircraft production line and the lone widebody military aircraft production line in the USA, according to Boeing. At least two countries – Australia and Canada – have publicly announced an intention to purchase a C-17, though neither factor into Boeing’s future planning, Pitts says. Until contracts are finalised, the number available remains eight, she says. The Royal Canadian Air Force already has four C-17As, according to Flightglobal’s World Air Forces 2014 directory. Canadian news outlets reported earlier in December that the air force would buy one C-17 with money left over at the end of 2015.",

Ultimately, the best bet is going to come form the 787's that take a fewer people (so you can do the longer routes) with still a competitive CASM, and the B and F class folks will pay good money for newer aircraft. Postby Kartik » 04 Dec 2014 12:55\nLets see if there is any forward movement on the stalled MTA project once Putin arrives in New Delhi\nMajor defence deals to be signed during Putin-Modi summit\nIn this connection, it is expected that during the summit, Russia and India may ultimately resolve several long-delayed agreements on military-technical cooperation projects between the two countries and sign them finally for their implementation. These agreements, above all, include joint Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project and joint development of Multi-role Transport Aircraft (MTA). A final deal on FGFA for production has been delayed because the Indian Air Force (IAF) did not approve the design and work-share. Now Russia has reportedly agreed that the jet would be a two-seat design, not a one-seater. India’s work-share would also be increased from18 percent to 25 percent, and even up to 40-50 percent in the near future, in view of the steady development of the Indian aviation industry. Defence and SecurityAccording to the agreement, India’s stealth air-to-air missile “Astra” along with Indo-Russian BrahMos supersonic cruise missile will be mounted on the FGFA. The preliminary design agreement on FGFA had been signed in 2010 between Indian HAL and Russian Sukhoi Design Bureau to build the jet for the use by both countries. The final design contract was to be signed in July-August 2012. But the deadline has already passed. According to the Indian media reports, under the programme, India is expected to build 200 fighter jets at the cost of $30 billion. FGFA is not the only Indo-Russia joint project. The two countries also signed an agreement on the joint development of MTA in 2007, based on Il-214 Russian plane."

      "AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Lou Woleneck. I'm from the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. I'm a graduate student. I have a question, a general policy question, about how we should go about providing the information resources to the have-nots that the information elites have access to now. What sort of strategy that you all would have for that? KAPOR: A 30-second or less answer, which is to set a national policy that updates a universal service for the 21st century that says everybody needs to have basic minimal access to a digital platform that reaches into every home, into every office and school in the country. We should focus our attention on how to put in place the least expensive amount of infrastructure that will produce that. What we find is, if we do that, then the overwhelming majority of American families will find it already within their budget to be able to do that, because it will be priced like basic phone service. To the extent that we need to continue or even slightly expand the kinds of lifeline programs that subsidize today's basic voice telephone service for a small percentage of the population, we should be prepared to renew that commitment. We don't need to bankrupt ourselves to give everybody access to a digital platform. JIM WARREN: My name is Jim Warren. Two quick observations: there were several cynical comments during the last several days about a number of IRS people being here. It turns out, because they never had a platform to say this, that the whole crowd from the IRS who are here, as I understand it, are from the IRS privacy project, intent on developing policies to assure privacy protection for taxpayer information. So let us not be so cynical about their being here; otherwise, remember that they are simply doing what they are told to do by our representatives. (laughter and hisses) I was also bothered by both Simon's, and (my God!) Esther's comments on those evil little men, and the men in politics, etc. Gee, this is a modern age, let's say \"men and women,\" for evil deeds, as well as good deeds.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "It's a debate and should be a debate about who does what best. It should be revised from time to time, but the important question is, If we get a significant distribution system like cable television, how should we classify it? I speak here from the heart, because 20 years ago, I was trying to fasten onto, or gain the recognition for, cable as a broadband distribution system which was only trivially in the program production and publishing business, but was very much in the distribution business and ought to have been treated as a common carrier open to all information suppliers. Had that happened, we would have been very much further along in the vision that some of us had 20 years ago. (applause) It tends to support what I said about not going in for premature freezing or characterization of how things look. It was decided, because the broadcasters felt threatened, to treat cable as a species of broadcasting. That's the greatest frittering away of resources in my lifetime, and perhaps in the lifetime of the United States of America. Let's not make that mistake again. Let's be clear-eyed and ask the broad-scale questions about public use and benefit. Thank you. LIASSON: Let's open it up to the audience. If you have any questions ... oh my God, wrestle your way to the microphone!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Let us not forget the history of the commons in which a wealthy society creates in its overflowing abundance structures on which all people can participate. This was originally, back in medieval society, the structure that was created for the support of the poor. In the abundance of the land in which the overpopulation was not a question, and there was much agriculture to go around, and the poor were supported out of the commonly-owned things that were jointly owned by all society. That's all I have to say. LIASSON: Who wants to start?\nDAVIES: Sticking to my apocalyptic vision just for the moment, because that's how I'm characterized, what I would like to see, just as my own social experiment, if you like, is for the various groups that this room represents and groups that you are all involved in, is to actually set up the apocalyptic vision, and then see how you as part of the information technology community can utilize it, stop it, or reverse it."

      "In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space. For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: • We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks. • We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. • We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries. In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - . Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either. Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.",

Table\n\nabstract\n\nDuring the patient's hospitalization, the physician must record daily observations of the patient and summarize them into a brief document called \"discharge summary\" when the patient is discharged. Automated generation of discharge summary can greatly relieve the physicians' burden, and has been addressed recently in the research community. Most previous studies of discharge summary generation using the sequenceto-sequence architecture focus on only inpatient notes for input. However, electric health records (EHR) also have rich structured metadata (e.g., hospital, physician, disease, length of stay, etc.) that might be useful.",
      "This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs. Our results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information. INTRODUCTION\n\nClinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , . Discharge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming. Researchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases. Therefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure."

In January 2014 we conducted preliminary scoping research to better understand the operational and socioeconomic characteristics of Tanjung Luar’s shark fishery. During a three-week scoping visit a team of four trained Indonesian enumerators conducted semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FDGs) with fishers, boat owners and traders, alongside naturalistic observation in the field. Respondents were selected through purposive sampling, since the research was exploratory in nature and a priori sampling decisions were not possible . We conducted a total of 34 semi-structured interviews (S1 File) and four FDGs, which were attended by a total of 30 individuals. All interviews and discussions took place in Indonesian, with the help of a local enumerator who was fluent in the Tanjung Luar local dialect. Interviews took approximately 30 minutes, with no remuneration for participating. All respondents gave their full prior and informed consent before contributing to the research. During the interviews and FDGs we gathered information on number of boats, fishing gears used, fishing grounds, fishery operational characteristics, and shark supply chain, including estimated volumes and value of shark catch relative to other fisheries. We improved the accuracy of information on shark fishery characteristics and fishing behaviour through informal daily interactions and discussions with 131 shark fishers during our daily landings data collection and community engagement activities.",

As with CPUE of all catch, there was a positive relationship between unstandardised CPUE (catch per set) of threatened and regulated species and number of hooks, but a significant negative relationship between standardised CPUE (catch per 100 hooks per set). This was likely due to diminishing returns of adding additional hooks, and indicates that the effort for threatened and regulated species was exceeding maximum sustainable yield effort, such that increases in effort (e.g. hook number) were leading to decreases in catch [28–30]. Due to the profitability of the shark industry in Tanjung Luar, and limited adaptive capacity and willingness of shark fishers to move into other industries, it is necessary to identify practical and ethical management interventions that can improve the sustainability of the fishery whilst also mitigating the negative socio-economic consequences for coastal communities. Our findings indicate that spatiotemporal closures and restrictions on fishing effort could improve the overall catch per unit effort and sustainability of the Tanjung Luar shark fishery, and lead to positive conservation outcomes for priority species. Since the location of shark fishing grounds plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of catching threatened species and their associated CPUE, improved marine spatial planning, with the identification of marine protected areas (MPAs) that protect critical shark habitat and shark populations, could reduce catch of species of conservation concern [31–33] and increase abundance of sharks [34, 35]. Provincial governments in West Papua and West Nusa Tenggara have already established ‘shark sanctuary’ MPAs, which protect critical shark habitat and ban shark fishing within their boundaries [16, 36], and monitoring data indicates positive impacts of shark-specific closures on shark abundance",
      "Shark fishing forms an integral part of the livelihood strategies of many coastal communities [22, 23], and prohibiting catches will not necessarily lead to positive conservation outcomes [21, 46]. Management interventions must take into account local context and the motivations and well-being of fisher communities in order to be ethical, feasible and impactful. S1 Dataset.

      "As a summary, it can be argued that SDN/NFV based 5G Slicing will provide new tools for security management, and, when combined with IoT-MDM system functionalities, together these can deliver a better device management framework for different kinds of user devices of the 2020s. Hospital organizations are considered as critical infrastructure (CI) to nation states [3, 25]. As a critical infrastructure, hospital organizations are prone to security threats that can affect health policies, public health, healthcare services, surgical procedures, electronic patient records, patient privacy, doctor-patient communication, etc. Lehto and Ahokangas  notes, new technology (e.g. next generation mobile networks, smart data storage, IoT) adoption of CIs increases the cybersecurity touchpoints and hence making the CIs more vulnerable. Broadly, from cybersecurity perspective, the hospital organizations in future will be vulnerable from management perspective (e.g. organizing healthcare services, managing huge amount of patient data, clinical data, medication data, communication between health professional and patients etc.), healthcare service delivery perspective (e.g. in an unwelcoming case of denial of service attacks in hospital context: like wannacry), network perspective (e.g. security of the overall hospital network), and last but not the least from an individual privacy perspective (e.g. individual patient records, healthcare professional logs, etc.). A futures digital hospital will consist various advanced technologies, such as critical medical devices, intelligent information systems and digital communication tools, which are fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital operations, patient safety, and the overall patient experience. Among them, many will be wireless mobile devices, wireless wearables and thousands of smart IoT devices for various kinds of measurements . Innovations help transform healthcare in forms of advanced telecommunications techonology, new drugs and treatments like biological sensor pills or implants, new medical devices, social media interation, etc.",
      "The coming of fifth generation (5G) of telecommunications networks is seen to result in this kind of disruption. As we are gradually moving towards 5G, it is worthwhile to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like, and what relevant business possibilities could emerge from cybersecurity in the healthcare context. From this perspective, in this paper, we open up discussions on business possibilities relevant to Internet of Things mobile device management for critical infrastructures such as future digital hospital. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor. A futures digital hospital facility is envisioned to consist tech-aided advanced critical medical devices, intelligent information systems, digital communication tools, hundreds of handheld mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), wireless clinical wearables, in addition to thousands of smart IoT nodes [6, 7]. These devices should be fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital functions, patient safety and privacy, and, overall improve patient experience through secure and reliable healthcare services. However, inclusion of these various kinds of digital devices to the hospital context make the overall device network quite complex and heterogeneous . Thus, from a critical infrastructures view point, to manage, configure, update and secure the immense fleet of digital devices besides all the high-tech medical equipment, the futures digital hospital will need to redefine device management policy and services . Mobile device management (MDM) systems are usually referred to “support centralized control of an entire fleet of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) and mobile applications by applying and ensuring pre-defined configuration settings” [8, 9]. In the scope of this paper, we broadly use the term IoT-MDM to refer to a device management system that is capable of managing, configuring and updating both handheld mobile devices and IoT devices in combination in a centralized manner.",
      "Though in this research, we adopt a high-level stance on cybersecurity from a technical perspective, the overall discussions on business potential are relevant to issues like information security, communication security, storage security, security at vulnerable touchpoints in hospital context (end user interface layer, IoT nodes, system layer, network layer). Futures digital hospitals will be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats because of its data-dependency and digital-intensive device network. Thus, the business opportunity for cybersecurity providers in this case can be considered as the need for automated and centralized IoT-MDM service. To that end, this paper presents four distinct players who can provide such service to a critical infrastructure like a digital hospital. The mixed-source business model options further open up multiple alternatives that each type of vendor can consider while tailoring services for the future digital hospital . This paper also connects the 4C ICT business model archetypes to cybersecurity business context which can be used as an analytical tool to identify customer needs and scope for value creation . Academically, this work contributes by filling up the void in discussing business models for cybersecurity as an industry. In addition, in the existing literature the hospital context has also been less discussed from a cybersecurity business perspective. From an industrial point of view, the business model options discussed in this research are timely and relevant to the market context and need. As mentioned, the mixed source business model options show how cybersecurity providers can extend their offering for different kinds of need for the hospital context based on their core businesses. This study can prove to be helpful for cybersecurity business entities and at the same time hospital managers. The scope of this paper explains business potential of cybersecurity vendors to an emerging industry from a higher level. In this paper, authors do not attempt to analyze the technical aspect of cyber security provisioning in healthcare context, however that is a forthcoming research possibility of this study.",
      "Hospitals as critical infrastructures has been historically dependent on various types of devices and equipment that are being revolutionized with digitalized solutions. The digitalization of conventional healthcare equipment is added with the new inclusion of numerous new devices for data collection, analysis, communication, and so on. All in all, the futures digital hospitals in 5G will be exponentially more data-dependent and digital-intensive. For that, this paper looks to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like, and what relevant business possibilities could emerge for cybersecurity providers in the healthcare context. In this paper, we open up discussions on business possibilities relevant to Internet of Things-mobile device management for critical infrastructures such as future digital hospital. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT-Mobile device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor. The healthcare sector has progressed significantly since the introduction of Internet and proliferation of network technologies . Among many issues, the use of data, availability of data, data mass, and access control of data in healthcare remain are critical for keeping healthcare services trustworthy and secure for the end users, both hospital staff and the patients. Disruptions in healthcare services would have severe effects on people’s lives. However, as hospital managers and professionals need to design their data-dependent and digital-intensive networks in a manner, which is highly secure, they also should provide the basis for uninterrupted service for business sustainability. Security is often observed as a tradeoff between risk and business gains . Investing in security is important in order to secure business-critical systems and data for meeting business goals and eventually for creating competitive advantage [3, 4]. Innovative technologies have the power to disrupt industries and prompt business transformation .",
      "From environmental viewpoint, regulations and other business partner influence are significant drivers for MDM adoption. Finally, from technology point of view, perceived security benefits and perceived cost of the service seems to affect the managerial attitude towards MDM adoption. MDM systems are today a very common tool to manage users’ devices. With MDM, all mobile device types, tablets and PCs with typical operating systems can be controlled centrally . It is often thought that MDM can manage only mobile phones, but actually the MDM framework includes also users’ identities and profiles. This makes MDM a viable tool for organizations to manage their employees identities, user profiles, all devices, all applications and security controls under same system. From an emerging technology perspective, SDN (software-defined network)/NFV (network functions virtualization) based 5G Slicing will challenge some of the traditional MDM features . Especially end-to-end security from device to IT cloud is difficult to realize with MDM. Of course, it is possible to force the use of VPN in mobile device with MDM, but many aspects of communications security will be still unsolved. Thus, 5G slicing provides new tools to control and manage the end-to-end communications flow with network functions (VNFs). In the advent of IoT, this is particularly important since the billions of IoT devices of the 2020s will have only a minimal processing power and memory compared to the smart phones of today. These IoT devices may connect to network only once a month and communicate only with network edge cloud servers. Therefore, managing these new IoT devices cannot be done with conventional MDM systems of today. Fortunately, many features of MDM can be provided by dedicated 5G slices and their VNFs. If e.g. a IoT device does not have the latest anti-virus updates, the network slice may still provide the isolation and security controls so that the IoT device can send the metering data. Moreover, if the IP flow from the IoT device includes other than actual metering data, eg. due to malware in IoT device, this IP flow can be analyzed and filtered by slice specific VNFs before passing it to IoT could."

Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene regioisomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell π-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closedshell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core. Switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule is observed by changing its adsorption site on NaCl. The inclusion of non-benzenoid carbocyclic rings is a viable route to tune the physicochemical properties of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) . Non-benzenoid polycycles may lead to local changes in strain, conjugation, aromaticity, and, relevant to the context of the present work, induce an open-shell ground state of the corresponding PCHs . Many nonbenzenoid PCHs are also non-alternant, where the presence of odd-membered polycycles breaks the bipartite symmetry of the molecular network .",
      "The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording compound 6 (8 mg, 11%) as a white solid. in AFM imaging due to their reduced adsorption height compared to the rest of the carbon atoms. We attribute this observation to the significantly different lattice parameter of Cu(111) (2.57 Å) compared to Au(111) and Ag(111) (2.95 Å and 2.94 Å, respectively) , such that the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings of 5 adsorb on the on-top atomic sites on Au(111) and Ag(111), but not on Cu(111). Our speculation is based on a previous study of polymers of 1 on Au(111) by Di Giovannantonio et al. , where both tilted and planar individual units of 1 were observed depending on whether the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings in 1 adsorbed on the on-top or hollow sites of the surface, respectively. Given the strong molecule-metal interaction, we found no electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces. STM set point for AFM images: V = 0. e, Frontier orbital spectrum of 5 -1 . In the anionic state, ψ2 becomes doubly occupied and ψ1 is the SOMO. Filled and empty circles denote occupied and empty orbitals, respectively. For each panel, zero of the energy axis has been aligned to the respective highest-energy occupied orbital.",
      "Fundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state . With regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state . Electronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state. Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekulé triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained."

      "D) The rear spar attach fittings were installed backwards, causing misalignment and structural stress."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it. I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily. When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank.",
      "His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro. I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings. I also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet. Next we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall. Next we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project. At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either.",
      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed.",
      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough."

      "Magnetic field presents another caveat. Magnetic field lines\nshould close, or $\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0$ should hold. Radial\nfield is much larger than perpendicular in the inner region. Therefore, characteristic radial scale of the flow is much larger\nthan perpendicular. If radial turbulence scale is larger than\nradius, freezing-in condition does not hold anymore. Matter can\nfreely slip along radial field lines into the black hole. If\nmatter slips already at the sonic point, the accretion rate should\nbe higher than calculated. Some other assumptions are more likely to be valid. Diffusion\nshould be weak because of high Mach number that approaches unity\nat large radius. Magnetic helicity was found to play very small\ndynamical role. Only when the initial turbulence is highly\nhelical, magnetic helicity conservation may lead to smaller\naccretion rate. Neglect of radiative cooling is justified a\nposteriori. Line cooling time is about $20$ times larger that\ninflow time from outer boundary. The study is the extension of basic theory, but realistic\nanalytical models should include more physics. The work is\nunderway.\n\\begin{theacknowledgments}\nI thank my advisor Prof. Ramesh Narayan for fruitful discussions. \\end{theacknowledgments}\n\n\\bibliographystyle{aipproc}",
      "Because magnetic field dissipates, infall\nonto the black hole can proceed \\citep{schwa}. Turbulence is supported by external driving in the outer flow\nregions, but internal driving due to freezing-in amplification\ntakes over in the inner flow Fig\\ref{fig2}. Magnetization of the\nflow increases in the inner region with decreasing radius\nconsistently with simulations \\cite{igumen06}. Density profile\nappears to be $\\rho\\sim r^{-1.25}$ that is different from\ntraditional ADAF scaling $\\rho\\sim r^{-1.5}$ \\citep{narayan}. Thus\nthe idea of self-similar behavior is not supported. Compared to non-magnetized accretion, infall rate is 2-5 times\nsmaller depending on outer magnetization. In turn, gas density is\n2-5 times smaller in the region close to the black hole, where\nsynchrotron radiation emerges \\citep{narayan}. Sgr A* produces\nrelatively weak synchrotron \\citep{narayan}. So, either gas\ndensity $n$ or electron temperature $T_e$ or magnetic field $B$\nare small in the inner flow or combination of factors works. Thus\nlow gas density in magnetized model is in qualitative agreement\nwith the results of modelling the spectrum. Flow is convectively stable on average in the model of moving\nblobs, where dissipation heat is released homogeneously in volume. Moving blobs are in radial and perpendicular pressure\nequilibriums. They are governed by the same equations as the\nmedium.\n\n\\section{Discussion \\& Conclusion}\\label{discussion}\nThe presented accretion study self-consistently treats turbulence\nin the averaged model. This model introduces many weak assumptions\ninstead of few strong ones. I take dissipation rate to be that of collisional MHD simulations. But flow in question is rather in collisionless regime. Observations of collisionless flares in solar corona\n\\citep{noglik} gives dissipation rate $20$ times smaller than in\ncollisional simulations \\citep{biskamp03}. However, flares in\nsolar corona may represent a large-scale reconnection event rather\nthan developed turbulence. It is unclear which dissipation rate is\nmore realistic for accretion.",

      "\\section{Introduction}\nThe averaged quantities can be obtained in two different ways in\nmagnetohydrodynamics. The first way is to solve 3D MHD equations\nand then average the results. The second way is to solve some\nsystem of equations on averages. Combination of numerical\nsimulations and averaged theory brings phenomenology that can\ndescribe observations or experimental data. The problem of spherically symmetric accretion takes its origin\nfrom Bondi's work \\citep{bondi}. He presented idealized\nhydrodynamic solution with accretion rate $\\dot{M}_B.$ However,\nmagnetic field $\\vec{B}$ always exists in the real systems. Even\nsmall seed $\\vec{B}$ amplifies in spherical infall and becomes\ndynamically important \\citep{schwa}. Magnetic field inhibits accretion \\citep{schwa}. None of many\ntheories has reasonably calculated the magnetic field evolution\nand how it influences dynamics. These theories have some common\npitfalls. First of all, the direction of magnetic field is usually\ndefined. Secondly, the magnetic field strength is prescribed by\nthermal equipartition assumption. In third, dynamical effect of\nmagnetic field is calculated with conventional magnetic energy and\npressure. All these inaccuracies can be eliminated. In Section 2\\ref{section_method} I develop a model that abandons\nequipartition prescription, calculates the magnetic field\ndirection and strength and employs the correct equations of\nmagnetized fluid dynamics. In Section 3\\ref{results} I show this\naccretion pattern to be in qualitative agreement with Sgr A*\nspectrum models. I discuss my assumptions in Section 4\n\\ref{discussion}.\n\n\\section{Analytical method}\\label{section_method}\n Reasonable turbulence evolution model is the key difference of my\n method. I build an averaged turbulence theory that corresponds to\nnumerical simulations. I start with the model of isotropic\nturbulence that is consistent with simulations of collisional MHD\nin three regimes. Those regimes are decaying hydrodynamic\nturbulence, decaying MHD turbulence and dynamo action.",

      "On his death bed, William instructed Polly, “let Mr. Falconar be my successor. ”[51] Magnus would immediately take over the running of the anatomy school and continue William’s unfinished research. Four months later, he and Dorothy would marry.[52] Essentially only two things changed at 27 Craven Street after William’s death: Polly gave birth to her daughter, and Magnus replaced William as the lease holder, so even if Margaret and Benjamin had wished to move back into No. 27, there would have been no room for them. It is also interesting to note that considering the multiple times Benjamin wrote of his move out of No. 27 (and complained of it), he never once mentioned moving back into No. 27 in any of his correspondence after Mr. Hewson’s death. Figure 6. No. 36 Craven Street. (Photo courtesy of David Ross, britainexpress.com) In sum, based on the Westminster Rate Books[53] and Franklin’s correspondence, Mrs. Stevenson is known to have resided at No. 27 (36) Craven Street from 1748 to 1772. It follows that, aside from the two years Franklin spent in Philadelphia from 1762 to 1764, he resided there from 1757 to 1772. Franklin’s correspondence also reveals that in the autumn of 1772, he and Mrs. Stevenson moved to another house on Craven Street. The 1773 Westminster Rate Books show her name crossed off at No. 27 and William Hewson’s inserted. The following year the Rate Books list her at No. 1 Craven Street. Evidence for Mrs. Stevenson and Benjamin remaining at No. 1 after William’s death appears in the Westminster Rate Books for 1775 which have Mrs. Stevenson still residing at No. 1 and Magnus Falkner residing at No. 27. Further evidence can be construed from the lack of any mention of a move back into No. 27 in Franklin’s correspondence. Despite the many theories one could devise as to why Franklin was thought to have lived at No. 7 Craven Street by so many guide books and Franklin biographers of the nineteenth century, one thing is certain; at some point after Franklin’s departure to America in March of 1775, and no later than 1807, someone mistakenly associated him with No. 7 on the west side of Craven Street, and it soon became his de facto residence."

The equation is discretized in space using a discretization step of 22 64 resulting in a state vector x of dimension 64 and a nonlinear system of coupled ODEs.

We trained the model for 200000 iterations using Adam and a learning rate of 5 • 10 4 and assuming a five-dimensional latent space. We obtained the λ's in Figure . Four latent variables have λ's close to zero and thus a slow temporal dynamic that is responsible for the long-term evolution whereas one latent variable is quickly decaying. Based on the obtained parameters, we do predictions based on an unseen initial condition not contained in the training data. We are able to reconstruct the correct phase space based on our predictions despite only using a very limited amount of training data. The results for the phase space can be seen in Figure .

It readily allows for the inclusion of sparse and irregularly sampled training data. The learned, latent dynamics are interpretable and reveal the different temporal scales involved. We show that this data-driven scheme can automatically learn the independent processes that decompose a system of linear ODEs along the eigenvectors of the system's matrix.

      "Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home\nFront Page » Time to clean house in Paso Robles\nSeptember 5, 2010 Opinion By JIM REED\nI’d like to give you an update on the issue of our civil servants cramming hundreds of millions of dollars in spending down our throats after the people of Paso Robles voted down the water rate increase last November. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney. Even if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again. There is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles. It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens’ wishes. City Councilmen Ed Steinbeck, Nick Gilman and Mayor Duane Picanco, on August 19th, voted unanimously to hire the same law firm employed by the City of Bell. You may have heard the recent news story about the City of Bell’s corrupt city representatives. This law firm allowed the elected officials and City employees to pillage the General Fund for their own benefit, contrary to the rights and interests of the citizens. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. What does this say about our elected representatives? I believe most residents are like me. We elect people we believe have our best interest in mind. Over the last few years I have seen that nothing is farther from the truth. The people we have elected have lost track of the fact that “the City” exists to protect and deliver services to the citizens. To them it is some all-important ideal they strive to cultivate and improve according to their agenda. They have forgotten that they are elected to represent the citizens. We have an election coming up in November. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us.",
      "If we elect more people from within this system, we will get more of the same type of government. We need to look at where the new candidates stand. Will they lawfully represent the citizens of the city? Or, are they happy with the way things are being run? We have stood together in the past and have made real significant changes in important matters that are going to affect our lives for years to come. There are several thousand citizens that made their voice heard on the water issue, more than enough votes to make a change in our city government. Please come out and vote for a democratic representative governing body for Paso Robles instead of the tyrannical leadership that exists now. Jim Reed is a longtime resident of Paso Robles.

I also am quite sure if you really contacted the Deputy Chief Counsel’s Office you have been set straight. What I gave you is a proposed small adjustment in the wide range of laws that make up the California Housing element. I assumed you could stumble onto the facts based on what I gave you. By the way, I believe you can review the Paso Robles Housing element plan on the City’s website or at the Library. The California Housing Element Laws that all cities and counties have to follow have been in place for almost 25 years. I realize you don’t actually have a clue how to look the laws up. Either educate yourself or keep making a fool of yourself, your choice. A simple Google search of California Housing Element Laws will get you going. Good Luck!

YOU DO WHAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DO SO WELL, AND THAT IS “IN ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER EAR” IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE EITHER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OR YOU HAVE OTHER DEALING WITH THE CITY, SO BE IT. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU THINK THE CITY DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT. APPARENTLY, YOU PRESENT YOURSELF AS BEING VERY BIAS ON CITY DECISIONS. IT LIKE THEY CAN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC. THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITIZENS OF PASO,THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ARROGANCE ALONG WITH NARCISSISM. WHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT DOESN’T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF WATER? ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WINERIES USING THE SAME AQUIFER? I BELIEVE YOU RELATED THAT YOU RESIDE IN TEMPLETON, BUT YOU OWN PROPERTY IN PASO.

I am going on vacation tomorrow, I’ll see you folks on the flip flop. Tags: Ann Schwab Chico CA, Ann Schwab for city council, Friends of Ann Schwab\nTurn that S*** UP! We had a lively discussion down at the library yesterday about how we are going to fight the phone tax increase in November. The key here is to inform the public. $taff has already done their best to make this measure confusing and deceptive, actually writing into the measure that it will lower taxes. They mean, they are lowering the rate half a cent, but of course, this half-cent will be an ice cube in hell when they apply the tax to all the new stuff this measure allows – starting with cell phones, texting, paging, and adding whatever new technology comes along. All the voter needs to know is, this measure will raise his/her taxes, noticeably. Even people on welfare will pay this tax, even though they qualify for the rate-assistance plans offered by the phone companies – utility tax is based on the total bill, before the adjustment for the rate assistance. And, this tax includes those prepaid phone cards. The hardest hit will be commercial customers. A friend of mine who owns a little manufacturing business in town tells me the city of Chico thinks all business owners are “rich sugar daddies”. My friend always tells me, that while I am in these meetings Downtown, he is in Oroville or Redding or Modesto or some other town, dealing with his business. He says these towns have better, more workable $taff. He is among the business owners who have used the word “hostile” to describe Dave Burkland, and the city business climate in general. We have to get the word out to people like my friend that NOW IS THE TIME to get involved.",
      "It’s easy to posture as the good guy when you know others will achieve the end result you really want. Evans’ resistance to making a pledge against a sales tax increase is screaming in my ear like a fire alarm. In Marysville, Mayor Bill Harris had no trouble making himself clear when his city mangler proposed a half-cent sales tax increase: “This will be viewed as the City Council coming to them wanting more money again.” Well, the article mentioned, the city mangler is retiring, so I would also see it as his way of securing his f-ing pension, but nobody mentions that. City councilwoman Christina Billeci echoed a sentiment I’ve been hearing increasingly in Chico – “We need to balance the budget with the revenues we have,” she said. Other council members cited lack of support from citizens, including one councillor who claimed to have got “angry reactions” to the proposal. One council member said he might have supported the move before the June election, “But the cigarette tax was voted down, and that should have been a slam dunk,” he said. “I would see this as a waste of effort and money.” The only council member who supported the notion, Head Start administrator Ricky Samayoa, made some pretty disparaging remarks about the town. “There’s a lot of people that know there’s a lack of resources here for us to have a proper city and manage it,” he said. Oooo! A “proper city”! What a bitch! Does he have letters from constituents to support this statement, or is he just using “a lot of people” to describe himself and his co-workers? Not enough drive through coffee stands for you Ricky? Not enough 5 Star restaurants or pink boutiques? Sorry, we’ve never been ones for putting on the Ritz here in the North State, better get in your zip car and drive back to the Bay Area. In the Enterprise Record story, Samoyoa further claimed that “continued cuts to maintenance and other aspects of the city’s budget hurt chances for an economic recovery.” I imagine Marysville has the same problem Chico has – too many $100,000+ salaries and not enough $20,000 – $50,000 workers."

      "Dobutamine stress echocardiography: This is a form of a stress echocardiogram diagnostic test. But instead of exercising on a treadmill or exercise bike to stress the heart, the stress is obtained by giving a drug that stimulates the heart and makes it “think” it’s exercising. The test is used to evaluate your heart and valve function if you are unable to exercise. It is also used to determine how well your heart tolerates activity, and your likelihood of having coronary artery disease (blocked arteries), and it can evaluate the effectiveness of your cardiac treatment plan. See also TTE and Stress Echocardiogram. Dressler’s syndrome – Happens to a small number of people three to four weeks after a heart attack. The heart muscle that died during the attack sets the immune system in motion, calling on lymphocytes, one of the white blood cells, to infiltrate the coverings of the heart (pericardium) and the lungs (pleura). It also starts generating antibodies, which attack those two coverings. Chest pain (CP) is the predominant symptom; treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Dual Antiplatelet Therapy – Medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets (examples Plavix, Effient, Brillinta, Ticlid, etc.) are often prescribed along with aspirin as part of what’s known as dual antiplatelet therapy, especially to patients who have undergone PCI and stent implantation. DVT – Deep Vein Thrombosis: A blood clot in a deep vein in the calf. ECG / EKG – Electrocardiogram: A test in which several electronic sensors are placed on the body to monitor electrical activity associated with the heartbeat. Ectopic beats – small changes in an otherwise normal heartbeat that lead to extra or skipped heartbeats, often occurring without a clear cause, most often harmless. EF – Ejection Fraction: A measurement of blood that is pumped out of a filled ventricle. The normal rate is 50-60%. EKG/ECG – Electrocardiogram: A test in which several electronic sensors are placed on the body to monitor electrical activity associated with the heartbeat.",
      "The elevated ST segment is how this type of heart attack got its name. See also NSTEMI. Stent – An implantable device made of expandable, metal mesh (looks a bit like a tiny chicken wire tube) that is placed (by using a balloon catheter) at the site of a narrowing coronary artery during an angioplasty procedure. The stent is then expanded when the balloon fills, the balloon is removed, and the stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. TRIVIA ALERT: the coronary stent was named after Charles Stent (1807-1885), an English dentist who invented a compound to produce dentures and other things like skin grafts and hollow tubes (essentially what a metal coronary stent is). His real claim to fame occurred when he suggested using his material to coat underwater trans-Atlantic cable, which had broken several times as a result of corrosion by seawater. You’re welcome. Stint – a common spelling mistake when what you really mean is the word “stent” (see above). Stress Echocardiography – A standard echocardiogram test that’s performed while the person exercises on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. This test can be used to visualize the motion of the heart’s walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed, possibly revealing a lack of blood flow that isn’t always apparent on other heart tests. The echocardiogram is performed just before and just after the exercise part of the procedure. See also TTE. Sudden Cardiac Arrest – The stopping of the heartbeat, usually because of interference with the electrical signal (often associated with coronary heart disease). Can lead to Sudden Cardiac Death. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy – A heart condition that can mimic a heart attack. Sometimes called Broken Heart Syndrome, it is not a heart attack, but it feels just like one, with common symptoms like severe chest pain and shortness of breath. It sometimes follows a severe emotional stress. Over 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75. Also referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome.",
      "Also called coronary artery disease and coronary heart disease. INR – International Normalized Ratio: A laboratory test measure of blood coagulation, often used as a standard for monitoring the effects of the anti-coagulant drug, warfarin (coumadin). IST – Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: A heart condition seen most often in young women, in which a person’s resting heart rate is abnormally high (greater than 100 bpm), their heart rate increases rapidly with minimal exertion, and this rapid heart rate is accompanied by symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, and/or exercise intolerance. Interventional cardiologist – A cardiologist who is trained to perform invasive heart procedures like angiography, angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), implanting stents, etc. IVS – Interventricular Septum: The stout wall that separates the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart from one another. IVUS – Intravascular Ultrasound: A form of echocardiography performed during cardiac catheterization in which a transducer (a device that can act as a transmitter (sender) and receiver of ultrasound information) is threaded into the heart blood vessels via a catheter; it’s used to provide detailed information about the blockage inside the blood vessels. LAD – Left Anterior Descending coronary artery: One of the heart’s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle. LAFB – Left Anterior Fascicular Block: A cardiac condition,distinguished from Left Bundle Branch Block because only the anterior half of the left bundle branch is defective and more common than left posterior fascicular block. LAHB – Left Anterior Hemiblock: The Left Bundle Branch divides into two major branches – the anterior and the posterior fascicles. Occasionally, a block can occur in one of these fascicles. Left Circumflex Artery – The artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body; it’s a branch of the Left Main Coronary Artery after the latter runs its course in between the aorta and the Main Pulmonary Artery. Left Main Coronary Artery – The artery that branches from the aorta to supply oxygenated blood to the heart via the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) and the Left Circumflex Artery."

W. Hilgenberg, Martin A. Smith. Institutions: University of California, Irvine (UCI).This video will guide you through the process for generating cortical neuronal cultures from late embryo and early postnatal mouse brain. These cultures can be used for a variety of applications including immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, electrophysiology, calcium and sodium imaging, protein and/or RNA isolation. These cultures also provide a platform to study the neuronal development of transgenic animals that carry a late embryonic or postnatal lethal gene mutation. The procedure is relatively straight forward, requires some experience in tissue culture technique and should not take longer than two to three hours if you are properly prepared. Careful separation of the cortical rind from the thalamo-cortical fiber tract will reduce the number of unwanted non-neuronal cells. To increase yields of neuronal cells triturate the pieces of the cortical tissue gently after the enzyme incubation step. This is imperative as it prevents unnecessary injury to cells and premature neuronal cell death.",
      "In order to study the potential role of these proteins in controlling dendritic spine morphologies/number, the use of cultured cortical neurons offers several advantages. Firstly, this system allows for high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines in fixed cells as well as time-lapse imaging of live cells. Secondly, this in vitro system allows for easy manipulation of protein function by expression of mutant proteins, knockdown by shRNA constructs, or pharmacological treatments. These techniques allow researchers to begin to dissect the role of disease-associated proteins and to predict how mutations of these proteins may function in vivo. Play ButtonIsolation and Culture of Mouse Cortical AstrocytesAuthors: Sebastian Schildge, Christian Bohrer, Kristina Beck, Christian Schachtrup. Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

ESTIMATION AND COMPARISON OF ARL OF THE CUSUM-OAL TEST\n\nIn this section we will give an estimation of the ARLs of the following CUSUM-OAL test that can be written as where g(.) is a decreasing function, Ẑn (ac x] denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Here Ẑn (ac) is a sliding average of the statistics, Next we discuss on the the post-change probability distribution in order to estimate the ARLs of T C (cg). Usually we rarely know the post-change probability distribution P v of the observation process before it is detected. But the possible change domain and its boundary (including the size and form of the boundary) about v may be determined by engineering knowledge, practical experience or statistical data. So we may assume that the region of parameter space V and a probability distribution Q on V are known. If we have no prior knowledge of the possible value of v after the change time τ , we may assume that v occurs equally on V , that is, the probability distribution Q is an equal probability distribution (or uniform distribution ) on V . For example, let P v be the normal distribution and v = (µ, σ), where µ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation respectively, we can take the set V = {(µ, σ) : and Q is subject to the uniform distribution U(V ) on V if v occurs equally on V , where the numbers µ 1 , µ 2 , σ 1 and σ 2 are known. It means that we know the domain of the possible post-change distributions, P v , v ∈ V , i.e., the boundary ∂V of the parameter space V is known. Next we shall divide the parameter space V into three subsets V + , V 0 and V − by the Kullback-Leibler information distance. Let and are two Kullblak-Leibler information distances between P v , P v 0 and P v , P v 1 . Since I(p|q)",
      "The estimation of the in-control and out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests and their comparison are given in Section 3. The detection performances of the three CUSUM-OAL tests and the conventional CUSUM test are illustrated in Section 4 by comparing their numerical out-ofcontrol ARLs. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks. Proofs of the theorems are given in the Appendix. AN OPTIMAL SLR TEST, TWO CUSUM-OAL TESTS AND THEIR LIMITING RELATIONSHIPS\n\nLet P 0 and E 0 denote the probability and the expectation respectively with the probability density p v 0 when there is no change for all the time. It is known that It follows from Proposition 2.38 in and (5.8)-(5.9) in Chow et al, P.108) that the following sequence test of sum of logarithmic likelihood ratio (SLR)\nfor B > 1, is optimal in the following sense min for P 0 (T SLR < ∞) = α, where c = log B and 0 < α < 1. In particular, if P 0 is the standard normal distribution with mean shift µ > 0 after changepoint, we have Z j − µ 0 = µX j , where µ 0 = −µ 2 /2. It follows from proposition 4 in that the SLR test T SLR in (4) is also optimal (minimal ARL 1 ) with the same false alarm probability P 0 (T < τ ). It can be seen that the in-control average run length of T SLR is infinite, that is, ARL 0 = E 0 (T SLR ) = ∞. However, the minimal ARL 1 with finite ARL 0 is a widely used optimality criterion in statistical quality control (see ) and detection of abrupt changes (see . In order to get finite ARL 0 for T SLR , we replace the constant control limit c of T SLR in (3) or (4) with the dynamic control limit n(µ 0 − r) and obtain a modified SLR test T SLR (r) in the following\nfor r ≥ 0. For comparison, the in-control ARL 0 of all candidate sequential tests are constrained to be equal to the same desired level of type I error, the test with the lowest out-of-control ARL v has the highest power or the fastest monitoring (detection) speed. In the following example 1, the numerical simulations of the out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests T C (cg u,0 ) in detecting the mean shifts of observations with normal distribution will be compared with that of the SLR tests T * (r) and T * (0), and that of the CUSUM-SLR test T C (c) ∧ T * (0) := min{T C (c), T * (0)} in the following Table .",
      "By the renewal property of the CUSUM test T C we have , where E 1 (T C ) is the out-of-control average run length (ARL 1 ), P k and E k denote the probability and expectation respectively when the change from p v 0 to p v 1 occurs at the change-point τ = k for k ≥ 1. Though we know that the CUSUM test is optimal under Lorden's measure (see Moustakides 1986 and Ritov 1990), the out-of-control ARL 1 of the CUSUM test is not small, especially in detecting small mean shifts ( see Table in Section 4). In other words, the CUSUM test is insensitive in detecting small mean shifts. Then, how to increase the sensitivity of the CUSUM test ? Note that the control limit in the CUSUM test is a constant c which does not depend on the observation samples. Intuitively, if the control limit of the CUSUM test can become low as the samples mean of the observation sequence increases, then the alarm time of detecting the increasing mean shifts will be greatly shortened. Based on this idea, by selecting a decreasing function g(x) we may define the ( upper-sided ) CUSUM chart T C (cg) with the observation-adjusted control limits cg( Ẑn ) ( abbreviated to the CUSUM-OAL chart ) in the following where c > 0 is a constant and Ẑn = n i=1 Z i /n. In other words, the control limits cg( Ẑn ) of the CUSUM-OAL test can be adjusted adaptively according to the observation information { Ẑn }. Note that the control limits cg( Ẑn ) may be negative. In the special case, the CUSUM-OAL chart T C (cg) becomes into the conventional CUSUM chart T C (c) in (1) when g ≡ 1. Similarly, we can define a down-sided CUSUM-OAL test. In this paper, we consider only the upper-sided CUSUM-OAL test since the properties of the down-sided CUSUM-OAL test can be obtained by the similar method. The main purpose of the present paper is to show the good detection performance of the CUSUM-OAL test and to give the estimation of its the in-control and out-of-control ARLs. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first present an optimal SLR sequential test, then define two sequences of the CUSUM-OAL tests and prove that one of the two sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to the optimal test, another sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to a combination of the optimal test and the CUSUM test."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nSpectral line surveys have revealed that high-mass star-forming\nregions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species\nto complex and larger molecules (e.g.,\n\\citealt{schilke1997b,hatchell1998b,comito2005,bisschop2007}). However, there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the\nchemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest\nevolutionary stages, i.e., from High-Mass Starless Cores (HMSCs) and\nHigh-Mass Cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass protostars\ndestined to become massive stars, via High-Mass Protostellar Objects\n(HMPOs) to the final stars that are able to produce Ultracompact H{\\sc\n  ii} regions (UCH{\\sc ii}s, see \\citealt{beuther2006b} for a recent\ndescription of the evolutionary sequence). The first two evolutionary\nstages are found within so-called Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). While\nfor low-mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular\nfreeze-out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin1997,dutrey1997,pavlyuchenkov2006,joergensen2007}),\nit is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present\nduring massive star formation. To better understand the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming\nregions we initiated a program to investigate the chemical properties\nfrom IRDCs to UCH{\\sc ii}s from an observational and theoretical\nperspective. We start with single-dish line surveys toward a large\nsample obtaining their basic characteristics, and then perform\ndetailed studies of selected sources using interferometers on smaller\nscales. These observations are accompanied by theoretical modeling of\nthe chemical processes. Long-term goals are the chemical\ncharacterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star\nformation, the development of chemical clocks, and the identification\nof molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes\nduring different evolutionary stages. Here, we present an initial\nstudy of the reactive radical ethynyl (C$_2$H) combining single-dish\nand interferometer observations with chemical modeling.",
      "Although\nC$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated\nRegions (e.g., \\citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not\nsystematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star\nformation.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{obs}\n\nThe 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\\,$\\mu$m window in fall 2006. We observed 1\\,GHz from 338 to 339\\,GHz and 1\\,GHz in the image\nsideband from 349 to 350\\,GHz. The spectral resolution was\n0.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to\n$\\sim$0.9\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around\n200\\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16\nmin. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward\nand beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively\n\\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\\sigma$ rms was 0.4\\,K.  The main\nspectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz\nwith upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\\,K (line blends of\nC$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \\& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at\n349.338\\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \\&\nC$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\\,GHz). The beam size was $\\sim\n18''$.\n\nThe original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the\nHMPO\\,18089-1732 were first presented in \\citet{beuther2005c}. There\nwe used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good\nimages for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we\nre-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because\nthe C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see\n\\S\\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The\nintegration range was from 32 to 35\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved\n$1\\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more\ndetails on these observations see \\citet{beuther2005c}. \\section{Results}\n\\label{results}\n\nThe sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs\nvia HMPOs to UCH{\\sc ii}s. We derived our target list from the samples\nof \\citet{klein2005,fontani2005,hill2005,beltran2006}.",
      "The\naccreted material is partially expelled, obscuring the X-ray emission\nfrom the surface of the white dwarf. At later stages, the ejected\nmaterial expands further and becomes optically thin, revealing the\nnuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf. This emission\npeaks in the soft X-ray regime and it is known as the super-soft\nsource (SSS) state (Krautter 2008). Models of the classical nova SSS\nstate can be found in Tuchman \\& Truran (1998) and Sala \\& Hernanz\n(2005). Though many classical novae have been observed in X-rays in their SSS\nstates (Ness et al.\\ (2007) for example discuss several examples observed with\nSwift), it is in the optical band, early in their outbursts, that\nclassical novae are almost always discovered. This is because they are\nintrinsically optically bright and easily found in inexpensive\nwide-area shallow surveys. XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual\ntherefore in that it has been discovered, as we shall see, later in\nits evolution, in the SSS X-ray state. In this paper we describe the XMM-Newton slew observations\n(Section~2), and the follow-up X-ray observations by the Swift XRT\n(Section~3) and XMM-Newton (Section~4). Multiwavelength observations\nwith Swift-UVOT, Magellan and ASAS are described in Section~5.

      "I tell people all the time I am a hick sheriff from a hick location, and by 2011, the rural county and its sheriff had big city problems. Greenup is near the stretch of interstate highways that provided drug traffickers and users with a straight shot to Palm Beach and Broward pill mills. It’s less than an hour’s ride to Huntington Tri-State Airport, where a $27 flight to Fort Lauderdale was a popular draw for dealers hoping to stock up. Arrests for Florida pills soon eclipsed local arrests for pot. “When we locked ’em up, we take all their pill bottles and all their paperwork, and we found maps to the doctors offices and everything,” recalled Cooper. “I called the (Florida) medical board and gave them a big list of doctors,” Cooper said. He called the state pharmacy board, too. He got no response. “So then I called the Attorney General’s Office and the Governor’s Office. I was calling them all, the whole state. Of course, I was talking to the state police the entire time. “I told them, all of the profits were down there. And all of the pain’s up here.” Nothing happened. Florida’s oxycodone pipeline continued to flow. On the other side of the law in Greenup, Mikey Frazier was banking on it. The Oxy Express\nFrazier was on a scholarship to play baseball at his junior college in Chicago when he suffered a torn rotator cuff. Doctors prescribed Percocet, a pill containing oxycodone, in 2002. When doctors cut him off, he bought it on the street. In 2006, he moved to OxyContin, nearly pure oxycodone. In 2007, he gave his friends money to go to Florida and bring him back pills. “My buddy had a minivan and he would actually go down one week and take two to three people with him, and then the following week I’d go,” said Frazier. He still remembers the route: “I’d take 64 East to 77 South to 95 South. And it’s just a straight shot.” Others followed suit. “What got everyone started was because the doctors around here won’t write a strong enough prescription,” he recalled. OxyContin and generic oxycodone still could be had — just not in Kentucky, which had a prescription drug monitoring database.",
      "A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy ‘pot of gold’\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida’s role in feeding the country’s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.",
      "Kenneth Hammond didn’t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot. Keith Konkol didn’t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills. An estimated 60 percent of her patients were from out of state, a former medical assistant told the DEA. In 2015, Averill pleaded not guilty to eight manslaughter charges. She is awaiting trial in Broward County. Averill was just one doctor at just one clinic. In 2010, the year Averill’s patients overdosed, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics. An online message board advising drug users summed it up: “Just go anywhere in South Florida and look for a ‘pain management clinic.’ It shouldn’t be too hard; you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting one.” Complain about anything from a back injury to a hangnail, it advised, “and they’ll set you right up.” By this time, Kentucky had reined in its pill mills. It didn’t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state’s efforts didn’t matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation’s oxycodone habit, the pills flowed. “There were folks down there, where if I had an opportunity to, get my hands around their throat, I would have wrung their neck,” said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. On Florida’s inaction he stated, “There was total evidence as to what was happening. It lays at the foot, in my opinion, of the public officials there that allowed it to continue on.” Governor Jeb Bush Backed A Solution\nOne of the first dinners Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hosted after moving into the governor’s mansion in 1999 was a small one."

[31] with permission, and the even rows are DBM simulation results. The typical wave patterns and the bubble's main characteristic structure are marked out in the figures.",
      "Finally, the jet structure disappears. The second quantitative comparison is the interface structure described by the length and width of the bubble, as shown in Fig. . The experimental data are extracted from Fig. , in Ref. . Quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results are seen. For the profile of bubble width, there are mainly two stages. At an early time (t < 150µs), it decreases to a minimum value because of the shock compression effect. After the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 150µs), the developed vortex pair caused by the deposited vorticity gradually dominates the growth of bubble width. Different from width evolution, the temporal variation of length experiences three stages. In the early stages (t < 150µs), it decreases quickly due to the shock compression effect. Then, the jet structure emerges, which results in a growth in length (150µs < t < 250µs). Because the upstream interface moves faster than the downstream interface, the bubble length would decrease at 250µs < t < 500µs. In the third stage (t > 500µs), the vortex pair forms and then leads to a continuous development of bubble length. Both the length and width experience oscillations in the later stages due to complex wave patterns. The quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities and spatial-temporal steps and simulation parameters like the relaxation times is suitable for characterizing the deformation of bubble, wave patterns, main characteristics of flow morphology. Effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI\n\nThe major of current works on SBI research have not focused on specific-heat ratio effects. In this part, the simulation parameters are fine-adjusted based on the parameters in Section 3.1 to highlight the influence of specific-heat ratio. Through adjusting the extra degree of freedom I, five cases with various specific-heat ratios of the bubble are simulated, i.e., γ = 1.4,\n1.28, 1.18, 1.12, and 1.09.",
      "Two kinds of analysis methods, including tracer particle method and two-fluid model, are used to characterize qualitatively the macroscopic behaviors such as the shape, deformation process, mixing degree, etc. The related TNE behaviors are also studied. Effects of specific-heat ratio on jet shape, deformation process, and average motion\n\nWe first observe the specific-heat ratio effect on the bubble shape from the view of density contour and images of particle tracer visually. As shown in Fig. , pictures with three typical moments are plotted, i.e., t = 0.07,t = 0.11, and t = 0.16. The odd rows represent density contours and the even rows are tracer particle images. It can be seen that the specific-heat ratio significantly affects the length and shape of the jet structure. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. The reason is that the specific-heat ratio significantly changes the propagation speed of shock waves and wave patterns inside the bubble. The specific-heat ratio also influences the vortex structure in early stage but contributes little effects to it in later stage. In the later stage, for cases with different specific-heat ratios, the differences in vortex pairs are almost invisible. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on deformation process are analyzed. Shown in Fig. are the evolutions of characteristic scales which used to describe the bubble size, i.e., width and length. It can be seen that the smaller the specific-heat ratio of bubble, the smaller the bubble width and length. For the fluid with smaller specific-heat ratio, it is easier to be compressed. Therefore, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. It can also be seen that the case with the largest specific-heat ratio reaches the minimum characteristic scales firstly. The reason is that the shock wave propagates faster in case with larger specific-heat ratio. Through the method of tracer, information on the average motion of the bubble is easy to obtain.",
      "Shown in Fig. are the average position and average velocity of the bubble, with different specific-heat ratios. It is found that, in the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the effect of specific-heat ratio contributes little to the average motion. However, when the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 0.03), a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles. The reason is that the bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio need more energy to compress their size, so their translational energy is smaller. Effects of specific-heat ratio on vortex motion\n\nVorticity is one of the most important physical quantities in describing the vortex motion. In the 2-D case, the vorticity can be calculated by the following equation: The positive (negative) value of ω represents the positive (negative) direction along the z axis. Vorticity contours at t = 0.134, with various specific-heat ratios, are shown in Fig. . The discernable difference between cases with various specific-heat ratios can be observed. The arrows in the vorticity images point out the obvious differences around the interface between case γ = 1.4 and case γ = 1.09. That is to say, there exists influences of specific-heat ratio on the rotational motion of the bubble. The strength of vorticity is described by circulation Γ, where Γ = ∑ ω∆x∆y. Γ + = ∑ ω| ω>0 ∆x∆y is the positive circulation and Γ − = ∑ ω| ω<0 ∆x∆y represents the negative circulation. Figure shows the temporal evolution of circulations on SBI process. It can be seen that the values of Γ are equal to zero all the time because the values of Γ + and Γ − are the same. But they point in the opposite direction. In the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the specific-heat ratio effect contributes little to the circulation of the bubble. When the shock wave sweeps through the bubble (t > 0.03), the specific-heat ratio affects the value of circulation obviously. The cases with a smaller specific-heat ratio experiences a larger range of amplitude of change, which is caused by its good compressibility."

      "Typically, this can occur when one parent carries the silent alpha thalassemia trait, and the other parent carries the 'cis' type of the alpha thalassemia trait. In this situation, there is a 25% chance for hemoglobin H disease in each of such a couple's children. Hemoglobin H disease-like symptoms can also be a part of a unique condition called alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome. Alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome can be caused by a deletion of a significant amount of chromosome 16, affecting the alpha globin genes. This is usually not inherited, but rather occurs sporadically in the affected individual. Affected individuals have mild hemoglobin H disease, mild-to-moderate mental retardation, and characteristic facial features. This syndrome can also occur as a sex-linked form in which a mutation is inherited in a particular gene on the X-chromosome. This gene influences alpha globin production, as well as various other developmental processes. Individuals affected with this form of the syndrome tend to have more severe mental retardation, delayed development, nearly absent speech, characteristic facial features, and genital-urinary abnormalities. The remaining discussion will focus only on aspects of hemoglobin H disease. Alpha thalassemia major results from the deletion of all four alpha globin genes, such that there are no functioning alpha globin genes. This can occur when both parents carry the 'cis' type of the alpha thalassemia trait. In this situation, there is a 25% chance for alpha thalassemia major in each of such a couple's children. Beta thalassemia major is characterized by severe anemia that can begin months after birth. In the United States and other developed countries beta thalassemia is identified and treated early and effectively. Therefore, the following discussion of symptoms applies primarily to affected individuals in the past and unfortunately in some underdeveloped countries now. If untreated, beta thalassemia major can lead to severe lethargy, paleness, and delays in growth and development.",
      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts.",
      "Therefore, hemoglobin E is unique in that it is both a quantitative (i.e. thalassemia-like) and qualitative trait. When co-inherited with a beta thalassemia trait, it causes a disease that is almost indistinguishable from beta thalassemia disease. Large deletions around and including the beta globin gene can lead to delta/beta thalassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Interestingly, delta/beta thalassemia trait behaves very similarly to beta thalassemia trait in its clinical manifestations. However, HPFH trait does not tend to cause hemoglobin disease when co-inherited with a second thalassemia or other beta globin mutation. ALPHA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have four normal copies of the alpha globin gene, two copies on each chromosome 16. These genes make the alpha globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, which is called hemoglobin A. Alpha globin is also a component of fetal hemoglobin and the other major adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin A2. Mutations of the alpha globin genes are usually deletions of the gene, resulting in absent production of alpha globin. Since there are four genes (instead of the usual two) to consider when looking at alpha globin gene inheritance, there are several alpha globin types that are possible. Absence of one alpha globin gene leads to a condition known as silent alpha thalassemia trait. This condition causes no health problems and can be detected only by special genetic testing. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs when two alpha globin genes are missing. This can occur in two ways. The genes may be deleted from the same chromosome, causing the 'cis' type of alpha thalassemia trait. Alternately, they may be deleted from different chromosomes, causing the 'trans' type of alpha thalassemia trait. In both instances, there are no associated health problems, although the trait status may be detected by more routine blood screening. Hemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of three alpha globin genes, such that there is only one functioning gene.",
      "In addition, hemoglobin H tends to precipitate out in the cells, causing damage to the red blood cell membrane. When affected individuals are exposed to certain drugs and chemicals known to make the membrane more fragile, the cells are thought to become vulnerable to breakdown in large numbers, a complication called hemolytic anemia. Fever and infection are also considered to be triggers of hemolytic anemia in hemoglobin H disease. This can result in fatigue, paleness, and a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of eyes called jaundice. Usually, the anemia is mild enough not to require treatment. Severe anemia events may require blood transfusion, however, and are usually accompanied by such other symptoms as dark feces or urine and abdominal or back pain. These events are uncommon in hemoglobin H disease, although they occur more frequently in a more serious type of hemoglobin H disease called hemoglobin H/Constant Spring disease. Individuals effected with this type of hemoglobin H disease are also more likely to have enlargement of and other problems with the spleen. Alpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha globin is a necessary component of all major hemoglobins and some minor hemoglobins, absence of all functioning alpha globin genes leads to serious medical consequences that begin even before birth. Affected fetuses develop severe anemia as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta, heart, liver, spleen, and adrenal glands may all become enlarged. Fluid can begin collecting throughout the body as early as the start of the second trimester, causing damage to developing tissues and organs. Growth retardation is also common. Affected fetuses usually miscarry or die shortly after birth. In addition, women carrying affected fetuses are at increased risk of developing complications of pregnancy and delivery. Up to 80% of such women develop toxemia, a disturbance of metabolism that can potentially lead to convulsions and coma. Other maternal complications include premature delivery and increased rates of delivery by cesarean section, as well as hemorrhage after delivery.",
      "Thalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nThalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nhttps://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Thalassaemia+minor\n(redirected from Thalassaemia minor)\nRelated to Thalassaemia minor: thalassaemia major\nThalassemia describes a group of inherited disorders characterized by reduced or absent amounts of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red blood cells. There are two basic groups of thalassemia disorders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These conditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which can range from insignificant to life threatening. All types of thalassemias are considered quantitative diseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemoglobin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemoglobin is made up of three components: alpha globin, beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classified according to the globin that is affected, hence the names alpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of thalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and beta thalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Beta thalassemia may be the most best-known type of thalassemia and is also called Cooley's anemia. It is caused by a change in the gene for the beta globin component of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemia that can range from moderate to severe, depending in part on the exact genetic change underlying the disease. Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinical symptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe anemia that can occur within months after birth. If left untreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growth and development, as well as other common physical complications that can lead to a dramatically decreased life-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries beta thalassemia is usually identified by screening in the newborn period, before symptoms have developed. Children who are identified early can be started on ongoing blood transfusion therapy as needed."

      "However, the difference is not significant for RSA (t = 1.117, p = 0.327). Specifically, the similarity score of SEW ResNet152 is only slightly higher than that of ResNet152, and at the depth of 50 and 101, SEW ResNet's scores are lower than ResNet's. Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Similar to the results of Allen Brain dataset, no model performs best for all three metrics. SEW ResNet performs moderately better than ResNet (t = 3.354, p = 0.028; t = 3.824, p = 0.019; t = 2.343, p = 0.079). The only contrary is that SEW ResNet18 performs worse than ResNet18 for RSA. Further, to check the details of comparison between the SNNs and their CNN counterparts, we analyze the trajectories of similarity score across model layers (Figure ). As for ResNet and SEW ResNet with the same depth, the trends of their similarities across model layers are almost the same, but the former's trajectory is generally below the latter's. In other words, the similarity scores of SEW ResNet are higher than those of ResNet at almost all layers. Taken together, the results suggest that when the overall results that appear below also correspond to the three metrics in this order, unless the correspondence is stated in the text. architectures and depth are the same, SNNs with spiking neurons perform consistently better than their counterparts of CNNs with an average increase of 6.6%. Besides, SEW ResNet14 also outperforms the brain-like recurrent CNN, CORnet-S, with the same number of layers (see more details in Appendix B). Two properties of SNNs might contribute to the higher similarity scores. On the one hand, IF neurons are the basic neurons of spiking neural networks. The IF neuron uses several differential equations to roughly approximate the membrane potential dynamics of biological neurons, which provides a more biologically plausible spike mechanism for the network. On the other hand, the spiking neural network is able to capture the temporal features by incorporating both time and binary signals, just like the biological visual system during information processing.",

      "To figure out the distinctions in the functional hierarchy between macaques and mice, for each cortical region, we obtain the normalized depth of the layer that achieves the highest similarity score in each model. Then, we divide models (excluding vision transformers) into two groups based on their depths and conduct investigations on these two groups separately. A nonparametric ANOVA is applied to each group for testing whether layer depths change significantly across cortical regions. For mouse visual cortex (Figure (a)), taking the deep model group as an example, ANOVA shows overall significant changes in depth across cortical regions for TSVD-Reg and RSA (Friedman's χ 2 = 49.169,\np = 2.0 × 10 −9 ; χ 2 = 19.455, p = 0.002). But there is no significant change for SVCCA (χ 2 = 8.689, p = 0.122). According to these results, the differences in depth across regions are indeterminacy and irregular. Meanwhile, the trends of layer depth between some regions contradict the hierarchy observed in physiological experiments of mice (those between VISp and VISrl for TSVD-Reg and between VISal and VISpm for RSA). However, for macaque visual cortex (Figure (b)), there are significant differences (t = −5.451, p = 6.5 × 10 −6 ; t = −8.312, p = 2.8 × 10 −9 ; t = −3.782, p = 6.9 × 10 −4 , also taking the deep model group as an example) between V4 and IT, and the trend is consistent with the information processing hierarchy in primate visual cortex. The comparative analyses of the best layer depths of the shallow and deep model groups also exhibit the differences between macaques and mice. For mouse visual cortex, the best layer depths of shallow models are significantly higher than those of deep models. Compared to deep models, most shallow models achieve the top similarity scores in intermediate and even later layers. Differently, for macaque visual cortex, the depth of models has little effect on the depth of the most similar layer. What's more, we find that the most similar layer of mouse visual cortex always occurs after the 28 × 28 feature map is downsampled to 14 × 14, which leads to the layer depths' difference between shallow and deep models."

      "Shopping for the Partially Built KR. This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly. Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me. After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.",
      "Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary. Seating is luxurious for one. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale. The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front. Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location. The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.",
      "Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd. This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites. Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides."

      "We validate and compare \\emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets. \\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation} For collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent. The gender diversity in the recruited participants reflects the gender distribution (85\\% female and 15\\% male) in the retirement community facility. A trained gerontology graduate student evaluator completes surveys with participants to fill out the surveys. Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \\emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability. We follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode \\cite{hugo14}.",
      "To tackle these, we make the following \\textbf{key contributions}:\n\n$\\bullet$ We employ an extensive signal deconvolution technique that in conjunction with machine learning technique helps facilitate a wrist-worn ACC-based multi-label (hand gestural and postural) activity recognition for diverse population. We then leverage multi-label context sets with ambient and object sensor signals for complex activity recognition based on HDBN model. $\\bullet$ We propose a novel collaborative filter for EDA signal processing by postulating signal as a mixture of three components: \\emph{tonic phase, phasic phase} and \\emph{motion artifacts}, and employ convex optimization technique for filtering out the motion artifacts. We also propose a novel PPG signal processing technique to filter out the inherent motion artifacts and noises using improved Periodic Moving Average Filtering (PMAF) technique. $\\bullet$  We design and prototype an IoT system consisting of multiple devices (wearable wrist band, IP camera, object and ambient sensors) connected with central hub via WiFi, Ethernet and Bluetooth communication protocols. We collected data from 22 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community center in a very natural setting (IRB \\#HP-00064387). $\\bullet$ Finally, we employ statistical and machine learning techniques to jointly correlate the activity performance metrics and stress (EDA and PPG) features that helps achieve max. 93\\% of cognitive impairment status detection accuracy. We evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} on 5 clinically validated offline assessment tools as ground truth. \\section{Related Works}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} builds on previous works on wearable devices based low-level (postural and hand gestural) activity recognition and their integration with ambient sensors to recognize complex ADLs, the underlying signal processing and applications on cognitive health assessment automation. \\subsection{Wearable Sensor Signal Processing}\nWearable sensors can be two types: physical and physiological.",
      "This sketching can help us significantly to identify which particular hand gesture is being performed in the time segment. \\subsubsection{EES Datasets: EDA and PPG Sensor Datasets} We used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed physiological signal processing approaches \\cite{picard01}. The dataset consists of measurements of four physiological signals (PPG/Blood Volume Pulse, electromyogram, respiration and Skin Conductance/EDA) and eight affective states (neutral, anger, hate, grief, love, romantic love, joy, and reverence). The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study. \\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}\nThough no frameworks ever combined all modalities together into real-time automated cognitive health assessment, we evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For hand gesture and postural activity recognition, we consider \\cite{alam17} proposed method as baseline. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network \\cite{zhu12} framework. For activity performance estimation, activity performance based cognitive health assessment; and EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment, we have considered \\cite{alam16} proposed method as baseline. \\subsection{Activity Recognition Evaluation}\nThe standard definition for \\emph{accuracy} in any classification problem is $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ where $TP,TN,FP$ and $FN$ are defined as true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. For complex activity recognition evaluation, we additionally consider \\emph{start/end duration error} as performance metric that can be explained as follows: consider that the true duration of ``cooking'' is 30 minutes (10:05 AM - 10:35 AM) and our algorithm predicts 29 minutes (10.10 - to 10.39 AM).",
      "Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults. \\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation} In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity."

      "His stats are terrific, despite being the sole focal point of opposing defenses, and hes capable of scoring in a variety of ways, particularly with his jumper. Hes hoping for an invite to Orlando. Renaldo Balkman, 6-8, PF, South Carolina Junior No Undrafted After winning the NIT MVP award, Balkman has decided to see where he stands in the eyes of the NBA by testing the waters. Hes likely to find them downright freezing, as hes a skinny and undersized power forward with little to no skills who came off the bench for a very average team. Larry Blair,6-1, SG, Liberty Junior No Undrafted The 22 point per game scorer Blair is attempting to get some exposure for himself by testing the waters. Will Blalock, Iowa State, 5-11, PG, Junior No Second round pick? Declared for the draft together with Curtis_Stinson after Iowa States coach was fired. Size is a big question mark. Will likely hope to attend the pre-draft camp in Orlando and try to show scouts hes a 1st rounder. Likely returns for his senior year. Jahsha Bluntt, 6-6, SG, Deleware State Junior No Undrafted Puts up fairly average numbers (14.6 ppg, 41% FG) in one of the worst conferences in America. Looking for exposure at the Orlando pre-draft camp but its highly unlikely to receive it. Josh Boone, 6-10, PF/C, UConn Junior No First round pick? Boone announced hell be entering the draft without an agent. An up and down season has left his stock in the air, and will likely force him to prove himself at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Would greatly benefit from a productive senior season as an offensive focal point now that UConn has lost almost all of its firepower from last year. Ronnie Brewer, 6-6, PG/SG, Arkansas Junior No Lottery pick? After initially wavering a bit on his decision, Brewer announced hell be entering the draft without an agent in a press conference. Brewer is considered a likely late lottery pick to mid-first rounder pick, as his physical attributes and array of versatile skills on both ends of the floor are highly sought after.",
      "Bobby Brown, 6-1, PG, Cal-State Fullerton Junior No First round pick? DraftExpress exclusively reported that Brown will be testing the waters. Still considered a bit of a sleeper because of the school he plays for, he will not be hiring an agent at this point. Some scouts are very high on his quickness and perimeter shooting ability and feel he will help his stock tremendously in private workouts. Shannon Brown, 6-4, SG, Michigan State Junior No First round pick? As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Brown will be testing the waters. He will likely conduct a number of workouts and attend the Orlando pre-draft camp to attempt and gauge where his stock lies. Scouts compare him to Celtic guard Tony Allen, but with a better attitude. Hes a very borderline first rounder in a draft that is stacked with shooting guards. Derek Burditt, 6-7, SG, Blinn Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted Unknown Junior College prospect. Not ranked as one of the top 25 JUCO players in the country, averaged around 17 points per game. Not burning his draft card as hes not yet an NCAA player, so really doesnt have much to lose, or gain. Leroy Dawson, 6-2, SG, Emporia State Junior No Undrafted Anonymous Division II player from the MIAA conference. 2nd team all conference, averaged 20 points per game. Like MANY on this list, only declaring because he can and has nothing to lose. Travis DeGroot, 6-4, SG, Delta State Junior No Undrafted Plays in a strong Division II conference, but is at best only the 3rd best prospect on his own team after Jasper Johnson and Jeremy Richardson, and is therefore not a prospect at all. Guillermo Diaz, 6-2, PG/SG, Miami Junior Yes First round pick? As reported by DraftExpress all year long, Diaz decided to forgo his senior year of college by hiring an agent, Miami based Jason Levien. One of the top athletes and shooters in the draft, which makes for an intriguing combination. Cem Dinc, 6-10, SF/PF, Indiana Freshman No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Dinc will be testing the waters.",
      "Hes yet another underclassmen with huge questions marks about his pro potential that will likely have to go to the Orlando pre-draft camp to show he is worthy of a first round pick. Made some great strides this year, but still has a ways to go, especially conditioning-wise. LeShawn Hammett 6-0, PG, St. Francis Junior No Undrafted Undersized combo guard played only 7 minutes in the mighty Northeast Conference before being suspended indefinitely for conduct detrimental to team. The NBA is clearly the only goal left for him to achieve. Brandon Heath, 6-3, PG/SG, San Diego State Junior No Second round pick? Streaky shooting combo guard Heath announced the he will test the NBA draft process this summer, and is hoping for an invite to the Orlando pre-draft camp. MWC player of the year; has a lot of wrinkles to his game that need to be ironed out before he can legitimately think about the NBA. Tedric Hill, 6-10, PF, Gulf Coast Community College Sophomore Yes Undrafted Ineligible to return to school after flunking out of college once again. Has bounced around over the past few years, and received some early hype from wannabe draftniks such as Gregg Doyel (CBS-Sportsline) and Sam Smith (Chicago Tribune) who compare him to Kevin Garnett. Very athletic we're told, but has absolutely no idea how to play the game. Has no chance of being drafted without an amazing showing at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Clarence Holloway 7-0, Center, IMG Academy (Prep School) 5th year High School No Undrafted Lone high school player in this years age-limit depleted draft. Former Louisville commit never got eligible for college and was always considered too slow and heavy to make much of an impact anyway. Reportedly lost weight and improved his grades this past year at IMG and is currently being recruited by UConn, Kansas State and Oklahoma, amongst others. Ekene Ibekwe, 6-9, PF, Maryland Junior No Undrafted Sources told DraftExpress exclusively that Ibekwe will be testing the waters. Likely only making this move because he can, as his chances of being drafted are very low.",
      "Athletic and long, but still lacking any type of polish. Donald Jeffers, 6-8, PF, Roxbury Community College Sophomore No Undrafted Anonymous junior college player. Alexander Johnson, 6-9, PF, Florida State Junior Yes First round pick? Sources told DraftExpress, that Johnson will be hiring an agent, mainly because he is already 23 years old. Hes considered intriguing because of his strength, raw offensive tools and freakish athleticism at the 4 position, and could work his way into the 1st round with strong workouts. David Johnson, 6-7, PF, Clinton Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted 6-7 JUCO power forward who averaged 2 points and 3 rebounds per game. Trey Johnson, 6-5, SG, Jackson State Junior No Undrafted Small school prolific scorer and one of the most accurate perimeter shooters in the country will attempt to draw some more attention to himself by testing the waters this summer. Johnson is hoping for a chance to prove himself in the Orlando pre-draft camp in June. Coby Karl, 6-4, PG/SG, Boise State Junior No Undrafted Son of Denver Nuggets head Coach George Karl put up nice numbers (17 ppg, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 39.5% 3P) in the underrated WAC conference. Had surgery in March to remove a cancerous lump from his thyroid. Mark Konecny, 6-10, Center, Lambuth (NAIA) Junior No Undrafted Transfer from Syracuse with mediocre production is looking for any type of exposure he can get before he graduates next season. Kyle Lowry, 6-1, PG, Villanova Sophomore No First round pick NCAA tournament performance showed that he definitely needs another year, but regardless, Lowry is in. For now its without an agent. Considering the lack of quality point guard prospects in this draft, Lowry is likely a first round pick. Says he will attend the Orlando pre-draft camp if invited. Aleks Maric, 6-11, Center, Nebraska Sophomore No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Maric will be testing the waters. What may have played a role in this is the fact that the assistant coach that recruited him at Nebraska, Scott Spinelli, just moved on to Wichita State.",
      "Lute Olson confirmed it, saying he is not concerned about it. Shakur is hoping for an Orlando invite to show what he thinks he couldnt at Point Guard U.\nCedric Simmons, 6-9, PF/C, NC State Sophomore No First round pick? Simmons is reportedly \"exploring his options,\" in regards to the 2006 NBA draft, but will do so without an agent. Nice size, frame, length, athleticism and defensive skills make him a very intriguing prospect. Marcus Slaughter, 6-8, PF, San Diego State Junior Yes Second round pick? After burning his lone draft card a year early last June, despite being considered a marginal prospect, Slaughter has announced that he will be hiring agent Dan Fegan and forfeiting his remaining college eligibility. Slaughters father thinks that There was nothing else for Marcus to do at San Diego State. Many would disagree with that. Curtis Stinson, 6-3, PG/SG, Iowa State Junior Yes Second round pick After swearing up and down last month that he has no intention on entering the draft, Stinson did just that. His coach Wayne Morgan, who he was very close to, was fired, resulting in him hiring agent Kevin Bradbury. The 23 year old combo guard will have to go to the Orlando pre-draft camp and impress if he wants to come close to being a 1st rounder. Tyrus Thomas, 6-9, PF, LSU Freshman Yes Top 5 pick As DraftExpress exclusively reported Thomas called a press conference to announce his intentions to enter the 2006 NBA draft, as well as hire agents Brian Elfus and Mike Siegel. SEC Freshman of the year could be the most athletic player in the draft, as well as the player with the most overall upside. PJ Tucker, 6-5, SF, Texas Junior No Second round pick As reported all year long by DraftExpress, Tucker will be entering the draft without an agent. Considering that hes a 6-5 combo forward with tremendous skills, his stock widely fluctuates depending on who is being asked. Phenomenal basketball player, but is severely lacking in 2-3 inches of height. Will likely need a strong showing at the Orlando pre-draft camp to have a legitimate shot at the 1st round."

      "Skidmore was wary of opioid painkillers, though, one reason her willingness in 2009 to work with Purdue was surprising. But she did it to get Florida’s dormant drug monitoring database up and running. Then a state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties, Skidmore recalled that, “They came to me and said, ‘Could you help get it across the finish line?’ ”\nOxyContin and prescription opioids, a serious problem in 2002, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years. Broward alone had more pain clinics than it had McDonald’s. Deaths tied to oxycodone had exploded, up by 263 percent since the prescription monitoring database had first been proposed and killed. Overdoses from prescription opioids were claiming more than seven lives a day. “By God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it,” Skidmore said. Skidmore believed a database wasn’t going to resolve the underlying addiction crisis. Still, it was a start. Not a silver bullet, but “maybe silver buckshot,” she said. The database law passed with gaping loopholes. No health care professional would have to report opioid prescriptions or check the database before prescribing more, and the state refused to pay for it. “Just to get that one little piece … took nine years of filing bills and then it had no teeth,” Skidmore said. “And it should have been the easiest piece.” Where Was The DEA and Everyone Else? The DEA all but wrung its hands over Florida’s lethal inaction. The agency ticked off a devil’s brew of regulatory loopholes: Florida’s Health Department regulated health care professionals but not pain clinics. The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration regulated pain clinics that accepted insurance, but pill mills were most often on a cash-only basis. And the prescription monitoring database, mired in a vendor dispute, remained stalled. In early 2011, when Gov. Rick Scott took office, just one drug — oxycodone — was tied to six fatal overdoses a day.",
      "Calling OxyContin street sales “a major threat to public health,” Butterworth told a state Board of Medicine committee that Purdue should consider temporarily taking the drug off the market. It wasn’t only traffickers concerning Butterworth. It was the sales pitch. In late 2001, Butterworth called a young assistant attorney general into his office and gave him a magazine article on OxyContin and an assignment: Look into Purdue marketing. Former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg. The young lawyer, now-Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, said he knew nothing about OxyContin. But he didn’t like what he read. During the yearlong inquiry, 589 Floridians died after taking oxycodone. Nothing criminal was found, Aronberg later said. Instead, Butterworth and Purdue struck a settlement. As part of a $2 million deal, Purdue would pay to establish a prescription monitoring database, the same silver bullet sought by Bush. After Florida’s computerized system was up and running, the same system would be free to any other state. The entire country, not just Florida, would benefit. It could have been a groundbreaking deal. There was one catch. State lawmakers had to vote to create the prescription monitoring program by 2004, or Purdue would keep its money. Marco Rubio Kills The Anti-Oxy Rx Bill\nA political gight killed the program. “And there was one person who was responsible,” said former state Sen. Burt, now an Ormond Beach insurance executive. “And it was Marco Rubio.” A rising state lawmaker in 2002, now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had the clout to make or break the legislation. He had been one of two state House majority whips and was on the fast track to becoming House speaker. Rubio didn’t kill the 2002 bill out of opposition to prescription monitoring—it was politics “as usual” yet nobody blamed Rubio for the resulting opioid crisis that seems to have started in his political backyard and flourished beyond belief.. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was a leader in the Florida House in 2002 when he blocked a vote on prescription monitoring.",
      "Kenneth Hammond didn’t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot. Keith Konkol didn’t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills. An estimated 60 percent of her patients were from out of state, a former medical assistant told the DEA. In 2015, Averill pleaded not guilty to eight manslaughter charges. She is awaiting trial in Broward County. Averill was just one doctor at just one clinic. In 2010, the year Averill’s patients overdosed, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics. An online message board advising drug users summed it up: “Just go anywhere in South Florida and look for a ‘pain management clinic.’ It shouldn’t be too hard; you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting one.” Complain about anything from a back injury to a hangnail, it advised, “and they’ll set you right up.” By this time, Kentucky had reined in its pill mills. It didn’t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state’s efforts didn’t matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation’s oxycodone habit, the pills flowed. “There were folks down there, where if I had an opportunity to, get my hands around their throat, I would have wrung their neck,” said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. On Florida’s inaction he stated, “There was total evidence as to what was happening. It lays at the foot, in my opinion, of the public officials there that allowed it to continue on.” Governor Jeb Bush Backed A Solution\nOne of the first dinners Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hosted after moving into the governor’s mansion in 1999 was a small one.",
      "That year, Rubio favored a bill changing the Miami-Dade County charter, which failed to pass because of a single “no” vote in the Senate. Burt cast the vote. Angered by what he saw as Burt’s betrayal, Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill. “When I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,” Rubio told The Miami Herald. It’s not certain that the full Legislature would have passed the bill had it made it to a floor vote. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders over years who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Most cited privacy concerns. But prescription monitoring databases in Florida and other states free to use Florida’s model would have pinpointed rogue doctors, would-be pill mills and doctor-shoppers across the country, just as all three were beginning to converge. In doing so, it could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem, not the monster it would become. Only weeks after the 2002 bill was killed, Bush suppressed a sob as he discussed his daughter’s arrest for forging a prescription. Court-ordered to drug treatment and then briefly to jail, Noelle Bush survived her pill addiction. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue’s million-dollar obligation to pay for it. Between 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, and late 2011, when the database finally came online, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners’ reports show. “Not getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,” said Burt. “There was heartache for thousands of families beyond measure and it didn’t have to happen.”\nFlorida Officials Were Told Of The Oxy Express\nThe East Kentucky hills and valleys of Greenup County suit Keith Cooper, a long-haired undercover cop-turned-sheriff: “It’s a backwater.",
      "Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse. Ohio’s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky’s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent. The DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation’s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida’s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma’s renewed offer to help pay for it. Scott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it. Attorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott’s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida’s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law. Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, “because (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place. Right?” In Greenup, an infuriated Cooper told a reporter, “In my opinion, (Scott’s) getting money from somewhere. He has to be.” A few days later, recalled Cooper, “A lieutenant with the state police I’d been talking to down there called me, said, ‘Man, just a head’s up: I wouldn’t come to Florida.’”"

      "Therefore, we\nwent back to a dataset obtained with the Submillimeter Array toward\nthe hypercompact H{\\sc ii} region IRAS\\,18089-1732 with a much higher\nspatial resolution of $\\sim 1''$ \\citep{beuther2005c}. Albeit this\nhypercompact H{\\sc ii} region belongs to the class of HMPOs, it is\nalready in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a\nrich molecular spectrum. \\citet{beuther2005c} showed the spectral\ndetection of the C$_2$H lines toward this source, but they did not\npresent any spatially resolved images. To recover large-scale\nstructure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA\nconfiguration (\\S\\ref{obs}). With this refinement, we were able to\nproduce a spatially resolved C$_2$H map of the line blend at\n349.338\\,GHz with an angular resolution of $2.9''\\times 1.4''$\n(corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700\\,AU at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc). Figure \\ref{18089} presents the\nintegrated C$_2$H emission with a contour overlay of the 860\\,$\\mu$m\ncontinuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar. In\ncontrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the\ndust continuum \\citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the\ncontinuum peak in a shell-like fashion.\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\n\nTo understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical\nmodeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass\nof 1200\\,M$_\\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\\,pc and a power-law density\nprofile ($\\rho\\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed\nconfiguration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud\nwith $T=10$\\,K, (2) $T=50$\\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature\nprofile $T\\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer\nradius of 44\\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV\nradiation field (IRSF, \\citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray\nparticles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\\mu$m\nsilicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel\ngeometry following \\citet{vandishoeck1988}.",
      "At the same time disks and\noutflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales. The\ndiameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\\,18089-1732 is\n$\\sim 5''$ (Fig.\\,\\ref{18089}), or $\\sim$9000\\,AU in radius at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc. This value is well matched by the modeled\nregion with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\\,\\ref{model}). Although\nin principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the\nC$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other\nobserved molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the\ncentral submm continuum emission in IRAS\\,18089-1732\n\\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation. The fact that we see C$_2$H at the earliest and the later evolutionary\nstages can be explained by the reactive nature of C$_2$H: it is\nproduced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by\nthe UV photodissociation of CO. The inner ``chemical'' hole observed\ntoward IRAS\\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in\nthe chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger\ncarbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion. The data show that C$_2$H is not suited to investigate the central gas\ncores in more evolved sources, however, our analysis indicates that\nC$_2$H may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of (massive)\nstar formation, like N$_2$H$^+$ or NH$_3$ (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin2002,tafalla2004,beuther2005a,pillai2006}). While a\nspatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the\nkinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical\nmodels, multiple C$_2$H lines will even allow a temperature\ncharacterization. With its lowest $J=1-0$ transitions around 87\\,GHz,\nC$_2$H has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between\nthe 3\\,mm and 850\\,$\\mu$m. Furthermore, even the 349\\,GHz lines\npresented here have still relatively low upper level excitation\nenergies ($E_u/k\\sim42$\\,K), hence allowing to study cold cores even\nat sub-millimeter wavelengths.",
      "Although\nC$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated\nRegions (e.g., \\citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not\nsystematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star\nformation.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{obs}\n\nThe 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\\,$\\mu$m window in fall 2006. We observed 1\\,GHz from 338 to 339\\,GHz and 1\\,GHz in the image\nsideband from 349 to 350\\,GHz. The spectral resolution was\n0.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to\n$\\sim$0.9\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around\n200\\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16\nmin. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward\nand beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively\n\\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\\sigma$ rms was 0.4\\,K.  The main\nspectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz\nwith upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\\,K (line blends of\nC$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \\& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at\n349.338\\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \\&\nC$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\\,GHz). The beam size was $\\sim\n18''$.\n\nThe original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the\nHMPO\\,18089-1732 were first presented in \\citet{beuther2005c}. There\nwe used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good\nimages for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we\nre-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because\nthe C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see\n\\S\\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The\nintegration range was from 32 to 35\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved\n$1\\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more\ndetails on these observations see \\citet{beuther2005c}. \\section{Results}\n\\label{results}\n\nThe sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs\nvia HMPOs to UCH{\\sc ii}s.

      "Although transfusion therapy prevents many of the complications of severe anemia, the body is unable to eliminate the excess iron contained in the transfused blood. Over time, the excess iron deposits in tissues and organs, resulting in damage and organ failure. Another medication must be administered to help the body eliminate the excess iron and prevent iron-over-load complications. Beta thalassemia intermedia describes the disease in individuals who have moderate anemia that only requires blood transfusions intermittently, if at all. Alpha thalassemia is the result of changes in the genes for the alpha globin component of hemoglobin. There are two main types of alpha thalassemia disease: hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major. The two diseases are quite different from beta thalassemia as well as from one another. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease can experience events of hemolytic anemia—anemia caused by the rapid breakdown of the red blood cells. These events are thought to be triggered by various environmental causes, such as infection and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Hemoglobin H disease is in most cases milder than beta thalassemia. It does not generally require transfusion therapy. Alpha thalassemia major is a very serious disease that results in severe anemia that begins even before birth. Most affected babies do not survive to be born or die shortly after birth. The thalassemias are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Both alpha and beta thalassemia have been described in individuals of almost every ancestry, but the conditions are more common among certain ethnic groups. Unaffected carriers of all types of thalassemia traits do not experience health problems. In fact, the thalassemia trait is protective against malaria, a disease caused by blood-borne parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. According to a widely accepted theory, most genetic changes—mutations—that cause thalassemia occurred multiple generations ago. Coincidentally, these mutations increased the likelihood that carriers would survive malaria infection.",
      "The body attempts to compensate by producing more blood, which is made inside the bones in the marrow. However, this is ineffective without the needed genetic instructions to make enough functioning hemoglobin. Instead, obvious bone expansion and changes occur that cause characteristic facial and other changes in appearance, as well as increased risk of fractures. Severe anemia taxes other organs in the body—such as the heart, spleen, and liver—which must work harder than usual. This can lead to heart failure, as well as enlargement and other problems of the liver and spleen. When untreated, beta thalassemia major generally results in childhood death, usually due to heart failure. In 2004, the first known heart attack associated with beta thalassemia major was reported. Fortunately, in developed countries diagnosis is usually made early, often before symptoms have begun. This allows for treatment with blood transfusion therapy, which can prevent most of the complications of the severe anemia caused by beta thalassemia major. Individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia have a more moderate anemia that may only require treatment with transfusion intermittently, such as when infections occur and stress the body. As a person with beta thalassemia intermedia gets older, however, the need for blood transfusions may increase to the point that they are required on a regular basis. When this occurs their disease becomes more similar to beta thalassemia major. Other genetic and environmental factors can influence the course of the disease as well. For example, co-inheritance of one or two alpha thalassemia mutations can tend to ameliorate some of the symptoms of beta thalassemia disease, which result in part from an imbalance in the amount of alpha- and beta-globin present in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin h disease\nAbsence of three alpha globin genes causes an imbalance of alpha and beta globin proteins in the red blood cells. The excess beta globin proteins tend to come together to form hemoglobin H, which is unable to release oxygen to the tissues.",
      "Although blood supplies in the United States are very safe, particularly relative to the past and to other areas of the world, there remains an increased risk of exposure to such blood-borne infections as hepatitis. Additionally, the body is not able to get rid of the excess iron that accompanies each transfusion. An additional medication called desferoxamine is administered, usually five nights per week over a period of several hours, using an automatic pump that can be used during sleep or taken anywhere the person goes. This medication is able to bind to the excess iron, which can then be eliminated through urine. If desferoxamine is not used regularly or is unavailable, iron overload can develop and cause tissue damage and organ damage and failure. The heart, liver, and endocrine organs are particularly vulnerable. Desferoxamine itself may rarely produce allergic or toxic side effects, including hearing damage. Signs of desferoxamine toxicity are screened for and generally develop in individuals who overuse the medication when body iron levels are sufficiently low. Overall, however, transfusion and desferoxamine therapy have increased the life expectancy of individuals with the most severe types of beta thalassemia major to the 4th or 5th decade. This can be expected to improve with time and increased developments in treatment, as well as for those with more mild forms of the disease. New treatments offer additional options for some individuals with beta thalassemia major. There are various medications that target the production of red blood cells (i.e. erythropoeitin) or fetal hemoglobin (i.e. hydroxyurea and butyrate). Their effectiveness in ameliorating the severity of beta thalassemia is currently being investigated. Another promising new treatment is bone marrow transplantation, in which the bone marrow of an affected individual is replaced with the bone marrow of an unaffected donor. If successful, this treatment can provide a cure. However, there is an approximately 10-15% chance the procedure could be unsuccessful (i.e. the thalassemia returns); result in complications (i.e. graft-versus-host disease); or result in death."

MR – Mitral regurgitation: (also mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence) a heart condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood. It’s the abnormal leaking of blood from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve and into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts. MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A technique that produces images of the heart and other body structures by measuring the response of certain elements (such as hydrogen) in the body to a magnetic field. An MRI can produce detailed pictures of the heart and its various structures without the need to inject a dye. MS – Mitral Stenosis: A narrowing of the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the heart’s upper left chamber (the left atrium) to its lower left chamber (the left ventricle). May result from an inherited (congenital) problem or from rheumatic fever.

PDA – patent ductus arteriosus: A persistent opening between two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The opening is called ductus arteriosus and is a normal part of a baby’s circulatory system before birth that usually closes shortly after birth. But when it remains open, it’s called a patent ductus arteriosus. If it’s small, it may never need treatment, but a large PDA left untreated can allow poorly oxygenated blood to flow in the wrong direction, weakening the heart muscle and causing heart failure or other complications. Pericardium: two thin layers of a sac-like tissue that surround the heart, hold it in place and help it work.

(Ventricles are the two main chambers of the heart, left and right). Angina (stable) – A condition marked by distressing symptoms typically between neck and navel that come on with exertion and go away with rest, caused by an inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle typically because of narrowed coronary arteries feeding the heart muscle. Also known as Angina Pectoris. Unstable angina (UA) occurs when fatty deposits (plaques) in a blood vessel rupture or a blood clot forms, blocking or reducing flow through a narrowed artery, suddenly and severely decreasing blood flow to the heart muscle. Unstable angina is not relieved by rest; it’s dangerous and requires emergency medical attention. Antiplatelet drugs – Medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets (examples: Plavix, Effient, Brillinta, Ticlid, etc).

UA or USA – Unstable Angina: Chest pain that occurs when diseased blood vessels restrict blood flow to the heart; symptoms are not relieved by rest; considered a dangerous and emergency crisis requiring immediate medical help. Valves: Your heart has four one-way valves that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Blood enters the heart first through the tricuspid valve, and next goes through the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve) on its way to the lungs. Then the blood returning from the lungs passes through the mitral (bicuspid) valve and leaves the heart through the aortic valve. Vasodilator: A drug that causes dilation (widening) of blood vessels.

      "Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances. Shadoks\n\nIn this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds. The algorithm uses σ = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = ∞ so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted. When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 • (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices. This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance σ. A good default value is σ = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting σ = 0 gives much worse results. Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions.",
      "Removing the easy vertices reduces the total number of vertices, making the conflict optimizer more effective. The Shadoks always toggle this option on (the challenge instances contain from 0 to 23% easy vertices). Results\n\nWe provide the results of the experiments performed with the code from the three teams on two classes of instances. First, we present the results on some selected CG:SHOP 2022 instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs , comparing the results of our conflict optimizer implementations to previous solutions. The source code for the three teams is available at: • Lasa: https://github.com/librallu/dogs-color • Gitastrophe: https://github.com/jacketsj/cgshop2022-gitastrophe • Shadoks: https://github.com/gfonsecabr/shadoks-CGSHOP2022\n\nCG:SHOP 2022 Instances\n\nWe selected 14 instances (out of 225) covering the different types of instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. The results are presented in Table . For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameters. The table shows the smallest number of colors for which HEAD found a solution. We ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core (the HEAD solver takes the target number of colors as a parameter and we increased this parameter one by one). At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23 colorings computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal (their number of colors is equal to the size of a clique). In order to compare the efficiency of the algorithms, we executed the different implementations on the CG:SHOP instance vispecn13806. The edge density of this graph is 19%, the largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. Notice that vispecn13806 is the same instance used in other Shadoks experiments in Section 5.",
      "The bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process. The goal is to prevent a vertex in conflict with some adjacent colored vertices from entering in the conflict set. At the first level, the algorithm searches for a recoloring of some adjacent vertices which allows us to directly recolor the conflict vertex. If no solution is found, the algorithm In both figures the algorithm uses p = 1.2, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. For σ ≥ 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. could recolor some vertices at larger distances from the conflict vertex. To do so, a local search is performed by trying to recolor vertices at a bounded distance from the conflict vertex in the current partial solution. The BDFS algorithm has two parameters: adjacency bound a max and depth d. In order to recolor a vertex v, BDFS gets the set C of color classes with at most a max neighbors of v. If a class in C has no neighbor of v, v is assigned to C. Otherwise, for each class C ∈ C, BDFS tries to recolor the vertices in C which are adjacent to v by recursively calling itself with depth d − 1. At depth d = 0 the algorithm stops trying to color the vertices. During the challenge the Shadoks used BDFS with parameters a max = 3 and d = 3. The depth was increased to 5 (resp. 7) when the number of vertices in the queue was 2 (resp. 1). Degeneracy order Given a target number of colors k, we call easy vertices a set of vertices Y such that, if the remainder of the vertices of G are colored using k colors, then we are guaranteed to be able to color all vertices of G with k colors. This is obtained using the degeneracy order Y . To obtain Y we iteratively remove from the graph a vertex v that has at most k − 1 neighbors, appending v to the end of Y . We repeat until no other vertex can be added to Y . Notice that, once we color the remainder of the graph with at least k colors, we can use a greedy coloring for Y in order from last to first without increasing the number of colors used."

      "To identify variables influencing the catch of threatened and regulated species we conducted a two-step process. In the first step, we identified factors influencing the likelihood of catching any threatened/regulated species during a given fishing trip, by creating binary response variables for whether a threatened species had been caught during a trip (yes = 1, no = 0), and separately for whether a regulated species had been caught during a trip (yes = 1, no = 0). We then fitted generalised linear models (GLMs) with binomial errors to the binary response variables, separately for catch of threatened species and catch of regulated species. In the second step we identified variables that significantly influenced the CPUE of threatened species and the CPUE of regulated species, given that any were caught. We removed all records in which no threatened or regulated species were caught, log transformed standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species, and fitted linear models (LMs) of standardised CPUE of threatened species and standardised CPUE to regulated species to fishing behaviour variables. Again, we considered all meaningful models and used minimum AIC values with stepwise analysis of variance to identify the best fit  and most significant influencing variables. This approach was necessary since catch of threatened and regulated species is zero-inflated, and creating binary response variables with a binomial error structure allowed for a simpler and more powerful statistical analysis. Note that we conducted two separate analyses, one for threatened species only and one for regulated species only, but used the same methods and process, as outlined above, for each analysis. We did not group threatened and protected species together, since although some species are both threatened and protected, this is not the case for all shark species landed in Tanjung Luar. A total of 52 shark fishing vessels operate from Tanjung Luar, all of which are classified as small-scale according to the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) vessel categorisation system, with <7GT capacity.",
      "The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching regulated species were month (January was significantly lower: p<0.001), number of hooks (p<0.001) and engine power (<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of regulated species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing gear (<0.001), number of sets (p<0.001), engine power (p<0.01) and month (November and January: p<0.05) (Table 5 and Fig 4). Plots of most significant factors affecting standardised CPUE (number of individuals per 100 hooks per set) of regulated species: a) hook number, b) gear type, c) number of sets. Although Tanjung Luar’s targeted shark fishery is small in scale, considerable numbers of shark are landed, including a large proportion of threatened and regulated species. A key finding is that measures of CPUE, for all sharks and for threatened and regulated species, vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. Moreover, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behaviour variables are different for different measures of CPUE (CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, CPUE per 100 hooks per set). This highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types, and has important implications for fisheries management. Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January. This is during the west monsoon season, which is characterised by high rainfall and adverse conditions at sea for fishing. Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly lower in West Nusa Tenggara Province (WNTP) than East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) and other provinces, suggesting a lower abundance of sharks in this area. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE, and was also associated with longer trips and more sets, which was likely due to the ability of vessels with larger engines to travel longer distances, over longer time periods, and with higher numbers of sets, to favoured fishing grounds.",
      "Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly higher for surface longlines than bottom longlines. However, when standardising CPUE for the number of hooks (i.e. individuals per 100 hooks per set) this relationship was reversed. Bottom longlines exhibit a higher standardised CPUE, with negative relationships between catch per 100 hooks per set and number of hooks and frequency of sets. Vessels with moderate engine horsepower (50-59hp) also had the highest standardised CPUE. Since surface longlines systematically employ significantly more hooks than bottom longlines (400–600 vs 25–200 hooks), and tend to be associated with larger boats, longer trips and more sets, these findings suggest that although increasing fishing effort increased total catch for these gears and trips, there were diminishing returns of this increased effort above low to moderate levels. A large proportion of Tanjung Luar’s shark catch consisted of threatened (22%) and regulated species (46%). Month is a significant factor in explaining standardised CPUE of both threatened and regulated species, which could indicate seasonal variation in the abundance of these species in the Tanjung Luar fishing grounds, or seasonal impacts on CPUE due to poor weather conditions. Fishing ground was a significant factor in explaining the catch of threatened species but not the catch in regulated species. This may be due to differences in range, distribution and relative abundance of species within these groups. Threatened species make up a relatively small proportion of Tanjung Luar’s catch in comparison to regulated species, which make up almost half of the catch (46%). As such, regulated species may generally be more abundant and spatially diffuse than threatened species, and therefore caught more uniformly across fishing grounds. For example, regulated species catch is dominated by silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are circum-tropical and coastal-pelagic, and exhibit limited site-fidelity or aggregation behaviour, while threatened species catch is dominated by scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), which are known to aggregate in schools.",
      "[37, 38]. Strengthening Indonesia’s existing MPA network for shark conservation, such as making all MPAs no-take zones for sharks and expanding spatial protection to critical shark habitat, including aggregation sites or pupping and nursery grounds for species of conservation concern, could have considerable conservation benefits. It should be noted, however, that MPAs may only be effective for certain species, such as those with small ranges or site-fidelity . More research is required to identify critical shark habitat and life history stages. For Tanjung Luar these efforts could focus on better understanding scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) aggregation sites. Well-targeted spatial closures for this species could significantly reduce catch of threatened species in this fishery. The relationships between gear type, several aspects of fishing effort (i.e. hook number, engine power, number of sets, trip length), standardised CPUE of all shark species and standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species suggest that there is an optimal effort that could increase overall CPUE of the fishery and significantly reduce fishing mortality of species of conservation concern. For example, our data suggest that CPUE peaks with low to intermediate trip lengths and gear sets, intermediate engine power and hook numbers of less than 75 per set longline. Although standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species is also higher when fewer hooks are deployed, the catch per set and overall mortality is significantly lower. Regulations that control the number of hooks in combination with incentives for shark fishers to tightly manage the number of hooks they deploy could significantly reduce mortality of threatened and endangered species, maximise the overall CPUE of the fishery, and reduce operational costs for fishers, making shark fishing in Tanjung Luar more sustainable and more cost effective [39–41]. Acknowledging that almost half of Tanjung Luar’s shark catch consists of CITES-listed species, developing measures that ensure both the sustainability of the fishery, and full traceability and control of onward trade, will be crucial for implementing CITES .",
      "We recorded 11,678 individual sharks, with an average total catch of 963 individuals per month (SD ± 434) and 19.7 individuals per trip (SD ± 15.6). Standardised CPUE (per 100 hooks per set) ranged from 0.05 to 22.13 individuals, with an average of 0.96 and a mode of 0.20. Catch consisted of 42 different species from 18 families (Table 4). 22% of all landings were classified as threatened species (i.e. VU, EN, CR) according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and 73% were near threatened. Almost half (46.3%) of landings were regulated (i.e. CITES-listed) species. The most commonly caught species were silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), black tip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). Table 4. Sharks species landed in Tanjung Luar from January 2014 –December 2015 (VU = Vulnerable, EN = Endangered, NT = Near Threatened, LC = Least Concern, NE = Not Evaluated (VU and EN classified as ‘threatened’ in this study); II = CITES Appendix II, N = Not CITES-listed (II species classified as ‘regulated’ in this study)). Measures of CPUE for the Tanjung Luar shark fishery vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. An initial comparison of average catch per trip and catch per set of the two major gear types, surface longline and bottom longline, indicates that CPUE of surface longlines was significantly higher than that of bottom longlines (ANOVA, p<0.001). CPUE (individuals per set) was also positively associated with number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets (Fig 2). However, these relationships are for unstandardised CPUE i.e. without controlling for number of hooks. Plots of CPUE: Number of individuals per set (A) and number of individuals per 100 hooks per set (standardised CPUE) (B) by gear type (1), number of hooks (2), number of sets (3) and engine horsepower (4). When controlling for hook number using standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set) the relationships were reversed, with standardised CPUE of bottom longlines significantly higher than that of surface longlines (ANOVA, p<0.001; Fig 2)."

Hence, there is a need to present the best and most relevant information, without overwhelming the consumer. Furthermore, consumers have varied interests depending on the time of a year or a day. As a result, there is also a need to cater to the time dependent changes in the consumer's interests while presenting information. Similarly, discovering new content is difficult when the consumer is overburdened with existing content.",
      "The user interface includes options for viewing a channel, requesting a new channel, modifying the user interests, and following suggested channels. FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a system for generating a stream of content for a channel. In this embodiment, the components of the channel application 103 are divided among various servers so that the information is efficiently processed. The system includes a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, an email server 141, a content categorizer 250, a data storage server 265, a model server 255, a scoring server 262, a social network server 101, a user device 115, and a channel application 103. A content categorizer 250 crawls the heterogeneous data sources (search server 135, entertainment server 137, ratings server 139, and email server 141) are crawled for new content items by the content categorizer 250 or the new content items are directly transmitted to the content categorizer 250. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the new content items as mentioned above with regards to FIG. 1B and stores them in the database 267 of the data storage server 265. The content categorizer 240 also includes a processing unit 202 for processing user information (activities, interests and social connections). In one embodiment, the processing unit 202 stores the database 267. In one embodiment, the data storage server 265 dynamically phases out the old content items. For example, news items expire after 24 hours, videos expire after 48 hours and feeds are kept for 24 hours or only the 10 most recent items, whichever is larger, etc. The content categorizer 250 also transmits the new content items to the scoring server 262 for a global user ranking. The global scores are transmitted from the scoring server 262 to the data storage server 265, which stores the global scores in association with the new content items. The global scores are helpful for organizing the new content items in the data storage server 265 according to the more popular items."

Gaffney, Joseph J. Bass, Thomas F. Barratt, Nathaniel J. Szewczyk. Institutions: University of Nottingham. Muscle is a dynamic tissue that responds to changes in nutrition, exercise, and disease state. The loss of muscle mass and function with disease and age are significant public health burdens. We currently understand little about the genetic regulation of muscle health with disease or age. The nematode C. elegans is an established model for understanding the genomic regulation of biological processes of interest. This worm’s body wall muscles display a large degree of homology with the muscles of higher metazoan species. Since C. elegans is a transparent organism, the localization of GFP to mitochondria and sarcomeres allows visualization of these structures in vivo. Similarly, feeding animals cationic dyes, which accumulate based on the existence of a mitochondrial membrane potential, allows the assessment of mitochondrial function in vivo. These methods, as well as assessment of muscle protein homeostasis, are combined with assessment of whole animal muscle function, in the form of movement assays, to allow correlation of sub-cellular defects with functional measures of muscle performance.",
      "Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping provided specific hardware and methodological criteria are followed. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices and stable micromanipulation allowing independent attainment of pre- and postsynaptic whole cell recordings. While CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell pairs are most widely used in the organotypic slice hippocampal preparation, this technique has also been successful in CA3-CA1 pairs and can be adapted to any neurons that are synaptically connected in the same slice preparation.

Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles. Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia.",
      "Unlike most established human glioblastoma cell line xenografts, injection of transformed GEM-derived cortical astrocytes into the brains of immune-competent littermates produced astrocytomas, including the most aggressive subtype, glioblastoma, that recapitulated the histopathological hallmarks of human astrocytomas, including diffuse invasion of normal brain parenchyma. Bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic allografts from transformed astrocytes engineered to express luciferase was utilized to monitor in vivo tumor growth over time. Thus, astrocytoma models using astrocytes and NSC harvested from GEM with conditional oncogenic alleles provide an integrated system to study the genetics and cell biology of astrocytoma pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and may be useful in preclinical drug development for these devastating diseases.

Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University. Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation.",

Institutions: VECT-HORUS SAS, CNRS, NICN UMR 7259.The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. Our aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. Astrocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection following trypsin digestion and were frozen for later co-culture. RBEC were isolated from 5-week-old rat cortices. The brains were cleaned of meninges and white matter, and mechanically dissociated following enzymatic digestion. Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders.

Firstly, this system allows for high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines in fixed cells as well as time-lapse imaging of live cells. Secondly, this in vitro system allows for easy manipulation of protein function by expression of mutant proteins, knockdown by shRNA constructs, or pharmacological treatments.

Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

      "A typical high resolution TEM image is shown in figure 6. Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters are not visible in RHEED patterns for temperatures below 180$^\\circ$C. To investigate the nature of these clusters, we performed x-ray diffraction in $\\theta-2\\theta$ mode. Diffraction scans were acquired on a high resolution diffractometer using the copper K$_\\alpha$ radiation and on the GMT station of the BM32 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Three samples grown at different temperatures and/or annealed at high temperature were investigated. The two first samples are Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 130$^\\circ$C and 170$^\\circ$C respectively. The third one has been grown at 130$^\\circ$C and post-growth annealed at 650$^\\circ$C. By analysing x-ray diffraction spectra, we can evidence two different crystalline structures. For the sample grown at 130$^\\circ$C, the $\\theta-2\\theta$ scan only reveals the (004) Bragg peak of the germanium crystal, confirming the good epitaxial relationship between the layer and the substrate, and the absence of secondary phases in the film in spite of a high dynamics of the order of 10$^7$. For both samples grown at 170$^\\circ$C and annealed at 650$^\\circ$C, $\\theta-2\\theta$ spectra are identical. In addition to the (004) peak of germanium, we observe three additional weak peaks. The first one corresponds to the (002) germanium forbidden peak which probably comes from a small distortion of the germanium crystal, and the two other peaks are respectively attributed to the (002) and (004) Bragg peaks of a secondary phase. The $c$ lattice parameter of Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ hexagonal crystal is 5.053 \\AA \\ \\cite{Fort90} which is in very good agreement with the values obtained from diffraction data for both (002) and (004) lines assuming that the $c$ axis of Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ is along the [001] direction of the Ge substrate. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\center\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig6.eps}\n\t\\caption{Cross section high resolution transmission electron micrograph of a sample grown at 170$^{\\circ}$C.

      "We also discuss the magnetic anisotropy of nanocolumns and  \nGe$_3$Mn$_5$ clusters. \\section{Sample growth}\n\nGrowth was performed using solid sources molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) by co-depositing Ge and Mn evaporated from standard Knudsen effusion cells. Deposition rate was low ($\\approx$ 0.2 \\AA.s$^{-1}$). Germanium substrates were epi-ready Ge(001) wafers with a residual n-type doping and resistivity of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 5 $\\Omega.cm$ respectively. After thermal desorption of the surface oxide, a 40 nm thick Ge buffer layer was grown at 250$^{\\circ}$C, resulting in a 2 $\\times$ 1 surface reconstruction as observed by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) (see Fig. 1a). Next, 80 nm thick Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films were subsequently grown  at low substrate temperature (from 80$^{\\circ}$C to 200$^{\\circ}$C). Mn content has been determined by x-ray fluorescence measurements performed on thick samples ($\\approx$ 1 $\\mu m$ thick) and complementary Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) on thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown on silicon. Mn concentrations range from 1 \\% to 11\\% Mn. For Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at substrate temperatures below 180$^{\\circ}$C, after the first monolayer (ML) deposition, the  2 $\\times$ 1 surface reconstruction almost totally disappears. After depositing few MLs, a slightly diffuse 1 $\\times$ 1 streaky RHEED pattern and a very weak 2 $\\times$ 1 reconstruction (Fig. 1b) indicate a predominantly two-dimensional growth. For growth temperatures above 180$^{\\circ}$C additional spots appear in the RHEED pattern during the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ growth (Fig. 1c). These spots may correspond to the formation of very small secondary phase crystallites. The nature of these crystallites will be discussed below. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed using a JEOL 4000EX microscope with an acceleration voltage of 400 kV. Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was done using a JEOL 3010 microscope equipped with a Gatan Image Filter .",
      "In summary, in a wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations, we have evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal decomposition leading to the formation of Mn-rich nanocolumns in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. This decomposition is probably the consequence of: $(i)$ a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms, $(ii)$ a strong surface diffusion of Mn atoms in germanium even at low growth temperatures and $(iii)$ layer by layer growth conditions. We have also investigated the influence of growth parameters on the spinodal decomposition: at low growth temperatures (100$^{\\circ}$C), increasing the Mn content leads to higher columns densities while at higher growth temperatures (150$^{\\circ}$C), the columns density remains nearly constant whereas their size increases drastically. By plotting the nanocolumns density as a function of Mn content, we have shown that the mechanism of Mn incorporation in Ge changes above 5 \\% of Mn. Finally, using TEM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C.\n\n\\section{Magnetic properties \\label{magnetic}}\n\nWe have thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films for different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. In this section, we focus on Mn concentrations between 2 \\% and 11 \\%. We could clearly identify four different magnetic phases in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films : diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix, low $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\leq$ 170 K), high $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\geq$ 400 K) and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters ($T_{C}$ $\\thickapprox$ 300 K). The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature ($<$ 120$^{\\circ}$C), we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing T$_{g}$ above 120$^{\\circ}$C, we first obtain continuous columns exhibiting low $T_{C}$ ($<$ 170 K) and high $T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) for $T_{g}\\approx$130$^{\\circ}$C.

      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
      "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume. To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value. While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
      "If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small. Therefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ. This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. . Indeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues. A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ). This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment."

Table\n\\ref{sample} lists the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated\nintensities and the FWHM line-widths of the C$_2$H line blend at\n349.399\\,GHz. The separation of the two lines of 1.375\\,MHz already\ncorresponds to a line-width of 1.2\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. We have three C$_2$H\nnon-detections (2 IRDCs and 1 HMPO), however, with no clear trend with\nrespect to the distances or the luminosities (the latter comparison is\nonly possible for the HMPOs). While IRDCs are on average colder than\nmore evolved sources, and have lower brightness temperatures, the\nnon-detections are more probable due to the relatively low sensitivity\nof the short observations (\\S\\ref{obs}). Hence, the data indicate\nthat the C$_2$H lines are detected independent of the evolutionary\nstage of the sources in contrast to the situation with other\nmolecules. When comparing the line-widths between the different\nsub-groups, one finds only a marginal difference between the IRDCs and\nthe HMPOs (the average $\\Delta v$ of the two groups are 2.8 and\n3.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$). However, the UCH{\\sc ii}s exhibit significantly\nbroader line-widths with an average value of 5.5\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$.\n\nIntrigued by this finding, we wanted to understand the C$_2$H spatial\nstructure during the different evolutionary stages.",
      "Therefore, we\nwent back to a dataset obtained with the Submillimeter Array toward\nthe hypercompact H{\\sc ii} region IRAS\\,18089-1732 with a much higher\nspatial resolution of $\\sim 1''$ \\citep{beuther2005c}. Albeit this\nhypercompact H{\\sc ii} region belongs to the class of HMPOs, it is\nalready in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a\nrich molecular spectrum. \\citet{beuther2005c} showed the spectral\ndetection of the C$_2$H lines toward this source, but they did not\npresent any spatially resolved images. To recover large-scale\nstructure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA\nconfiguration (\\S\\ref{obs}). With this refinement, we were able to\nproduce a spatially resolved C$_2$H map of the line blend at\n349.338\\,GHz with an angular resolution of $2.9''\\times 1.4''$\n(corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700\\,AU at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc). Figure \\ref{18089} presents the\nintegrated C$_2$H emission with a contour overlay of the 860\\,$\\mu$m\ncontinuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar. In\ncontrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the\ndust continuum \\citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the\ncontinuum peak in a shell-like fashion.\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\n\nTo understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical\nmodeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass\nof 1200\\,M$_\\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\\,pc and a power-law density\nprofile ($\\rho\\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed\nconfiguration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud\nwith $T=10$\\,K, (2) $T=50$\\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature\nprofile $T\\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer\nradius of 44\\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV\nradiation field (IRSF, \\citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray\nparticles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\\mu$m\nsilicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel\ngeometry following \\citet{vandishoeck1988}.",
      "At the same time disks and\noutflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales. The\ndiameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\\,18089-1732 is\n$\\sim 5''$ (Fig.\\,\\ref{18089}), or $\\sim$9000\\,AU in radius at the\ngiven distance of 3.6\\,kpc. This value is well matched by the modeled\nregion with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\\,\\ref{model}). Although\nin principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the\nC$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other\nobserved molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the\ncentral submm continuum emission in IRAS\\,18089-1732\n\\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation. The fact that we see C$_2$H at the earliest and the later evolutionary\nstages can be explained by the reactive nature of C$_2$H: it is\nproduced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by\nthe UV photodissociation of CO. The inner ``chemical'' hole observed\ntoward IRAS\\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in\nthe chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger\ncarbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion. The data show that C$_2$H is not suited to investigate the central gas\ncores in more evolved sources, however, our analysis indicates that\nC$_2$H may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of (massive)\nstar formation, like N$_2$H$^+$ or NH$_3$ (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin2002,tafalla2004,beuther2005a,pillai2006}). While a\nspatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the\nkinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical\nmodels, multiple C$_2$H lines will even allow a temperature\ncharacterization. With its lowest $J=1-0$ transitions around 87\\,GHz,\nC$_2$H has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between\nthe 3\\,mm and 850\\,$\\mu$m. Furthermore, even the 349\\,GHz lines\npresented here have still relatively low upper level excitation\nenergies ($E_u/k\\sim42$\\,K), hence allowing to study cold cores even\nat sub-millimeter wavelengths.",
      "Although\nC$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated\nRegions (e.g., \\citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not\nsystematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star\nformation.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{obs}\n\nThe 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\\,$\\mu$m window in fall 2006. We observed 1\\,GHz from 338 to 339\\,GHz and 1\\,GHz in the image\nsideband from 349 to 350\\,GHz. The spectral resolution was\n0.1\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to\n$\\sim$0.9\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around\n200\\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16\nmin. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward\nand beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively\n\\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\\sigma$ rms was 0.4\\,K.  The main\nspectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\\,GHz\nwith upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\\,K (line blends of\nC$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \\& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at\n349.338\\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \\&\nC$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\\,GHz). The beam size was $\\sim\n18''$.\n\nThe original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the\nHMPO\\,18089-1732 were first presented in \\citet{beuther2005c}. There\nwe used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good\nimages for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we\nre-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because\nthe C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see\n\\S\\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The\nintegration range was from 32 to 35\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved\n$1\\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more\ndetails on these observations see \\citet{beuther2005c}. \\section{Results}\n\\label{results}\n\nThe sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs\nvia HMPOs to UCH{\\sc ii}s. We derived our target list from the samples\nof \\citet{klein2005,fontani2005,hill2005,beltran2006}."

      "This proves that RSU learned the correct dynamic rules of how RF signals and trajectories evolve when the jammer and spoofer are absent (i.e., under normal situations). Also, we can see that the RSU can notice a high deviation on both the RF signal and the corresponding trajectory due to a jamming interference from what it has learned so far by relying on the abnormality signals. In contrast, we can see that under spoofing attacks, RSU notice a deviation only on the trajectory and not on the RF signal since the spoofer has affected only the positions without manipulating the RF signal. In addition, it is obvious how the proposed method allows the RSU to identify the type of abnormality occurring and to explain the cause of the detected abnormality (i.e., understanding if it was because of a jammer attacking the V2I link or a spoofer attacking the satellite link). \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{Results/trajectories_underJamming_andSpoofing}\n   \n    \\caption{Vehicle's trajectory under: normal situation, jamming and spoofing.}\n    \\label{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n        \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onRF}\n        \\\\[-1.5mm]\n        {\\scriptsize (a)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n            \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onGPS}\n            \\\\[-1.5mm]\n            {\\scriptsize (b)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        %\n        \\caption{Abnormality Signals related to the example shown in Fig.\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}: (a) abnormality indicators related to the RF signal, (b) abnormality indicators related to the trajectory.}\n            \\label{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[height=3.2cm]{Results/Detection_Probability_RFfromGPS_versusPj}\n    \\caption{Detection probability ($\\mathrm{P_{d}}$) versus jammer's power ($\\mathrm{P_{J}}$) using different number of clusters $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$.}\n    \\label{fig_jammerDetectionProb}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]",
      "In this work, we propose a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in the V2X network. A coupled generalized dynamic Bayesian network (C-GDBN) is employed to learn the interaction between RF signals received by the RSU from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. This integration of vehicles' positional information with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications allows semantic learning while mapping RF signals with vehicles' trajectories and enables the RSU to jointly predict the RF signals it expects to receive from the vehicles from which it can anticipate the expected trajectories. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \\textit{i)} A joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection method is proposed for the V2X scenario, which is based on learning a generative interactive model as the C-GDBN. Such a model encodes the cross-correlation between the RF signals transmitted by multiple vehicles and their trajectories, where their semantic meaning is coupled stochastically at a high abstraction level. \\textit{ii)} A cognitive RSU equipped with the acquired C-GDBN can predict and estimate vehicle positions based on real-time RF signals. This allows RSU to evaluate whether both RF signals and vehicles' trajectories are evolving according to the dynamic rules encoded in the C-GDBN and, consequently, to identify the cause (i.e., a jammer attacking the V2I or a spoofer attacking the satellite link) of the abnormal behaviour that occurred in the V2X environment. \\textit{iii)} Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the vehicles' trajectories from the predicted RF signals, effectively detect any abnormal behaviour and identify the type of abnormality occurring with high detection probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies the joint detection of jamming and spoofing in V2X systems. \\section{System model and problem formulation}\nThe system model depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_SystemModel}, includes a single cell vehicular network consisting of a road side unit (RSU) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{R}=[{x}_{R},{y}_{R}]$, a road side jammer (RSJ) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{J}=[{x}_{J},{y}_{J}]$, a road side spoofer (RSS) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{s}=[{x}_{s},{y}_{s}]$ and $N$ vehicles moving along multi-lane road in an urban area.",
      "However, V2X communication links carrying those messages are inherently vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the open and shared nature of the wireless spectrum among vehicles and other cellular users \\cite{8336901}. For instance, a jammer in the vicinity might alter the information to be communicated to nearby vehicles/users or can intentionally disrupt communication between a platoon of vehicles making the legitimate signals unrecognizable for on-board units (OBUs) and/or road side units (RSUs) that endanger vehicular safety \n\\cite{8553649}. In addition, the integrity of GPS signals and the correct acquisition of navigation data to compute position, velocity and time information is critical in V2X applications for their safe operation. However, since civil GPS receivers rely on unencrypted satellite signals, spoofers can easily replicate them by deceiving the GPS receiver to compute falsified positions \\cite{9226611}. Also, the long distance between satellites and terrestrial GPS receivers leads to an extremely weak signal that can be easily drowned out by a spoofer. Thus, GPS sensors' vulnerability to spoofing attacks poses a severe threat that might be causing vehicles to be out of control or even hijacked and endanger human life \\cite{9881548}. Therefore, GPS spoofing attacks and jamming interference needs to be controlled and detected in real-time to reach secured vehicular communications allowing vehicles to securely talk to each other and interact with the infrastructure (e.g., roadside terminals, base stations) \\cite{9860410}. Existing methods for GPS spoofing detection include GPS signal analysis methods and GPS message encryption methods \\cite{9845684}. However, the former requires the ground truth source during the detection process, which is not always possible to collect. In contrast, the latter involves support from a secured infrastructure and advanced computing resources on GPS receivers, which hinders their adoption in V2X applications. On the other hand, existing methods for jammer detection in vehicular networks are based on analysing the packet drop rate as in \\cite{9484071}, making it difficult to detect an advanced jammer manipulating the legitimate signal instead of disrupting it."

      "ConC began developing its recommendations for the 2008 committee chair appointments for consideration by the president-elect and chair of the board. ConC continues to focus efforts to identify members with the skills and expertise specified by the committee chairs using the councilor preference form. The form will be sent to councilors in May. ConC also seeks the names of noncouncilor members for consideration for service on council-related committees, especially those with no prior appointment. As part of ongoing activities with the joint CPC-Board Governance Review Task Force, ConC has collected data on committee liaisons to other committees. This information will be distributed to committee chairs. The number of liaisons indicates that unofficial but strong communication channels exist within the ACS committee structure. On Sunday evening, the Committee on Nominations & Elections (N&E) sponsored its fifth successful Town Hall Meeting for President-Elect Nominees. An estimated 200 people attended this session. This forum facilitated communication among the 2008 president-elect nominees, councilors, and other members. N&E will hold another Town Hall Meeting featuring the candidates for director-at-large at the fall meeting in Boston. Now that voting over the Internet has become an accepted procedure for ACS national elections, the ACS technical divisions and local sections have expressed strong interest in using this method for their elections. N&E has developed protocols for elections for local sections and divisions. This document will be forwarded to the appropriate committees for their review and distribution. N&E is responsible for reviewing annually the distribution of member populations within the six electoral districts to ensure that the districts have equitable representation. According to bylaw V, section 4(a), the member population of each electoral district must be within 10% of the result of dividing by six the number of members whose addresses lie within these districts.",
      "The committee received input from the Governance Review Task Force and its action teams, the Council Policy Committee, the board of directors, the Committee on Constitution & Bylaws, and several other committees between the San Francisco and Chicago meetings. These interactions have resulted in the current bylaw change recommendations. In Chicago, representatives from MAC attended several committee meetings and all seven councilor caucuses to summarize the current proposal for membership changes, answer questions, and seek input. In addition, all committee chairs were invited to have their respective committees review these bylaw changes and respond to MAC—if possible—before council met on Wednesday. MAC received 11 responses: eight supported the proposed changes as is, and three supported the proposed language with specified changes or considerations. The comprehensive petition will likely represent the most significant and voluminous change in the ACS bylaws that has occurred in decades, and MAC is proud to be among the leaders in its development and in efforts to get it right the first time. Hundreds of individuals have contributed to this major effort, since MAC began such discussions at the spring 2004 national meeting. The Committee on Ethics met in Chicago and discussed the possibility of organizing and scheduling a committee retreat in the near future to enable the committee to move from the current stage of exploring the needs and interests of ACS members to setting priorities for the next few years. The Project SEED program offers summer research opportunities for high school students from economically disadvantaged families. Since its inception in 1968, the program has had a significant impact on the lives of more than 8,400 students. At the selection meeting in March, the committee approved research projects for 340 SEED I students and 98 SEED II students for this summer in more than 100 institutions. The 2006 annual assessment surveys from 300 students indicate that 78% of the Project SEED participants are planning to major in a chemistry-related science, and 66% aspire to continue to graduate education.",

The committee was updated on the status of the activities of the Board Oversight Group on Leadership Development (BOG). Potential solutions for the unexpectedly high cost of facilitator training and transitioning from the current Leaders Conference format to the newly designed curriculum were presented to the committee. The committee reviewed plans for conducting the 2007 Membership Satisfaction Survey. Preliminary results are expected in May or June with a final report to be delivered to the board at the 2007 Boston national meeting. The committee received a briefing on the status of the MORE Project: Multidisciplinary Opportunities though Resource Enhancement. Twenty-eight proposals were received, and a decision on which proposals to support will be made in early May.

The third petition, the \"Petition on Multiyear Dues,\" was amended by incidental motion on the council floor, calling for the petition to become effective when technical components are instituted to track payments, but no later than Jan. 1, 2010. Council approved the incidental motion and then approved the petition. The committee reviewed one petition for consideration, the \"Petition on Local Section Affiliations,\" which will be submitted to council for action at the fall 2007 meeting in Boston.

A small, dedicated group of volunteers and staff labored tirelessly to create and coordinate this programming; to them the Committee on Divisional Activities (DAC) offers sincere thanks. DAC has committed to transfer the process of choosing and organizing future national meeting themes to a body that represents all divisions. We made substantial progress in Chicago, where division, secretariat, and committee representatives convened to discuss national meeting program concepts.

      "\"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call. Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project. When we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop. There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars.",
      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts."

      "Such a small moiré scale implies that the exact crystalline symmetry, which depends sensitively on fine details of rotation center, has critical influence on lowenergy response properties. To capture the Umklapp tunneling, we employ the tight-binding model . Figures ) and (c) show two distinct commensurate structures of tBG at θ = 21.8 • belonging to chiral point groups D 3 and D 6 , respectively. The atomic configurations in Figs. ) are equivalent, which are constructed by twisting AA-stacked bilayer graphene around an overlapping atom site, and that in Fig. ) is obtained by rotating around a hexagonal center. Band structures of these two configurations are drastically different within a low-energy window of ∼ 10 meV around the κ point . Remarkably, despite large θ, we still get σ H ∼ O(0.001) e 2 /h (D 3 ) and ∼ O(0.1) e 2 /h (D 6 ), which are comparable to those at small angles (cf. Fig. in the Supplemental Material ). Such sizable responses can be attributed to the strong interlayer coupling enabled by Umklapp processes . Apart from different intensities, the Hall conductivities in the two stacking configurations have distinct energy dependence: In Fig. , σ H shows a single peak centered at zero energy; In Fig. (f), it exhibits two antisymmetric peaks around zero. The peaks are centered around band degeneracies, and their profiles can be understood from the distribution of [∂ k × G] z . Figure (d) illustrates the atomic structure of tBG with a twist angle slightly deviating from θ = 21.8 • , forming a supermoiré pattern. In short range, the local stacking geometries resemble the commensurate configurations at θ = 21.8 • , while the stacking registries at different locales differ by a translation. Similar to the moiré landscapes in the small-angle limit, there also exist high-symmetry locales: Regions A and B enclose the D 3 structure, and region C contains the D 6 configuration. Position-dependent Hall response is therefore expected in such a supermoiré. As the intrinsic Hall signal from the D 6 configuration dominates [see Figs.\n3(e) vs (f)], the net response mimics that in Fig. .",
      "The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric fields generates Hall currents j ∼ Ė⊥ × E in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current. This novel intrinsic Hall response has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. We show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles. Nonlinear Hall-type response to an in-plane electric field in a two dimensional (2D) system with time reversal symmetry has attracted marked interests . Intensive studies have been devoted to uncovering new types of nonlinear Hall transport induced by quantum geometry and their applications such as terahertz rectification and magnetic information readout . Restricted by symmetry , the known mechanisms of nonlinear Hall response in quasi-2D nonmagnetic materials are all of extrinsic nature, sensitive to fine details of disorders , which have limited their utilization for practical applications. Moreover, having a single driving field only, the effect has not unleashed the full potential of nonlinearity for enabling controlled gate in logic operation, where separable inputs (i.e., in orthogonal directions) are desirable. The latter, in the context of Hall effect, calls for control by both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. A strategy to introduce quantum geometric response to out-of-plane field in quasi-2D geometry is made possible in van der Waals (vdW) layered structures with twisted stacking . Taking homobilayer as an example, electrons have an active layer degree of freedom that is associated with an out-of-plane electric dipole , whereas interlayer quantum tunneling rotates this pseudospin about in-plane axes that are of topologically nontrivial textures in the twisted landscapes ."

When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940. World War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942. By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best. During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.",
      "Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner. He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator. Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King. In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937.",
      "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command. Early life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.",
      "Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy. Revolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy. The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier. Later service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy.",
      "He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS). While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953. Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955. On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States."

      "AP reports that Iraqi police sought out a 19-year-old woman because of rumors that she was working with al Qaida in Mesopotamia only to be greeted with the news that her father allegedly killed her and the father showed the police where he buried the woman . . . last month. The story begs for more than it offers. The most obvious observation is: what does it say that a woman's allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month? After that, it should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, \"his wife, two sons and a nephew\" -- as well as injuring four more people, and a Samarra roadside bombing which claimed the lives of 2 police officers. DPA notes it was two homes bombed in Haswa and that the Samarra roadside bombing also injured four Iraqi soldiers. Jomana Karadsheh (CNN) reports, \"Another policeman was wounded in Baghdad Friday night when a roadside bomb detonated by a police patrol, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.\"And we'll close with this from Peace Mom Cindy Sheehan's latest Al Jazeera column:The recent repeal of the US military policy of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" is far from being the human rights advancement some are touting it to be. I find it intellectually dishonest, in fact, illogical on any level to associate human rights with any military, let alone one that is currently dehumanising two populations as well as numerous other victims of it's clandestine \"security\" policies. Placing this major contention aside, the enactment of the bill might be an institutional step forward in the fight for \"equality\"; however institutions rarely reflect reality. Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military?While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot - as a peace activist - rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals in one of the least socially responsible organisations that currently exists on earth: The US military.",

      "This picture was subsequently refined to include many-body excitation and autoionization, as well as attractive dipole-dipole interactions \\cite{Viteau,Pillet}, later confirmed by experiments at Rice \\cite{Mcquillen}. The Orsay group also studied the effect of adding Rydberg atoms to an established ultracold plasma. They found that electron collisions in this environment completely ionize added atoms, even when selected to have deep binding energies \\cite{Vanhaecke}. They concluded from estimates of electron trapping efficiency that the addition of Rydberg atoms does not significantly alter the electron temperature of the plasma. Tuning pair distributions by varying the wavelength of the excitation laser, Weidem\\\"uller and coworkers confirmed the mechanical effects of van der Waals interactions on the rates of Penning ionization in ultracold $^{87}$Rb Rydberg gases \\cite{Amthor_mech}. They recognized blackbody radiation as a possible means of final-state redistribution, and extended this mechanical picture to include long-range repulsive interactions \\cite{Amthor_model}. This group later studied the effects of spatial correlations in the spontaneous avalanche of Rydberg gases in a regime of strong blockade, suggesting a persistence of initial spatial correlations \\cite{RobertdeSaintVincent}. Robicheaux and coworkers have recently investigated the question of prompt many-body ionization from the point of view of Monte Carlo classical trajectory calculations \\cite{Goforth}. For atoms on a regular or random grid driven classically by an electromagnetic field, they find that many-body excitation enhances prompt ionization by about twenty percent for densities greater than $5.6 \\times 10^{-3}/(n_0^2 a_0)^3$, where $n_0$ is the principal quantum number of the Rydberg gas and $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. They observed that density fluctuations (sampled from the distribution of nearest neighbour distances) have a greater effect, and point to the possible additional influence of secondary electron-Rydberg collisions and the Penning production of fast atoms not considered by the model, but already observed by Raithel and coworkers \\cite{Knuffman}.",
      "Modelling observed expansion rates, they recently found that $^{85}$Rb atoms in a MOT form plasmas with effective initial electron temperatures determined by initial Rydberg density and the selected initial binding energy, to the extent that these parameters determine the fraction of the excited atoms that ionize by electron impact in the avalanche to plasma \\cite{Forest}. This group also returned to the question of added Rydberg atoms, and managed to identify a crossover in $n_0$, depending on the initial electron temperature, that determines whether added Rydberg atoms of a particular initial binding energy act to heat or cool the electron temperature \\cite{Crockett}. Our group has focused on the plasma that evolves from a Rydberg gas under the low-temperature conditions of a skimmed, seeded supersonic molecular beam. In work on nitric oxide starting in 2008 \\cite{Morrison2008,Plasma_expan,Morrison_shock,PCCP}, we established an initial kinetics of electron impact avalanche ionization that conforms with coupled rate equation models \\cite{Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling,haenelCP} and agrees at early times with the properties of ultracold plasmas that evolve from ultracold atoms in a MOT. We have also observed unique properties of the NO ultracold plasma owing to the fact that its Rydberg states dissociate \\cite{Haenel2017}, and identified relaxation pathways that may give rise to quantum effects \\cite{SousMBL,SousNJP}. The remainder of this review focuses on the nitric oxide ultracold plasma and the unique characteristics conferred by its evolution from a Rydberg gas in a laser-crossed molecular beam. \\section{Avalanche to strong coupling in a molecular Rydberg gas}\n\n\\subsection{The molecular beam ultracold plasma compared with a MOT}\n\nWhen formed with sufficient density, a Rydberg gas of principal quantum number $n_0>30$ undergoes a spontaneous avalanche to form an ultracold plasma \\cite{Li,Morrison2008,RobertdeSaintVincent}. Collisional rate processes combine with ambipolar hydrodynamics to govern the properties of the evolving plasma.",
      "This sequence of steps gives rise to a remarkable mechanics of self-assembly, in which the kinetic energy of initially formed hot electrons and ions drives an observed separation of plasma volumes. These dynamics redistribute ion momentum, efficiently channeling electron energy into a reservoir of mass-transport. This starts a process that evidently anneals separating volumes to a state of cold, correlated ions, electrons and Rydberg molecules. We have devised a three-dimensional spin model to describe this arrested state of the ultracold plasma in terms of two, three and four-level dipole-dipole energy transfer interactions (spin flip-flops), together with Ising interactions that arise from the concerted pairwise coupling of resonant pairs of dipoles \\cite{SousMBL,SousNJP}. The Hamiltonian includes the effects of onsite disorder owing to the broad spectrum of states populated in the ensemble and the unique electrostatic environment of every dipole. Extending ideas developed for simpler systems \\cite{Burin1,Sondhi}, one can make a case for slow dynamics, including an arrest in the relaxation of NO Rydberg molecules to predissociating states of lower principal quantum number. Systems of higher dimension ought to thermalize by energy transfer that spreads from rare but inevitable ergodic volumes (Griffiths regions) \\cite{Sarang2, Roeck_griffith, RareRegions_rev, Thermal_inclusions}. However, a feature in the self-assembly of the molecular ultracold plasma may preclude destabilization by rare thermal domains: Whenever the quenched plasma develops a delocalizing Griffiths region, the local predissociation of relaxing NO molecules promptly proceeds to deplete that region to a void of no consequence. In summary, the classical dynamics of avalanche and bifurcation appear to create a quenched condition of low temperature and high disorder in which dipole-dipole interactions drive self-assembly to a localized state purified by the predissociation of thermal regions. We suggest that this state of the quenched ultracold plasma offers an experimental platform for studying quantum many-body physics of disordered systems.",
      "In the wings, momentum redistribution owing to cycles of ion-Rydberg charge transfer retards radial expansion \\cite{Pohl2003,PPR}. By redirecting electron energy from ambipolar acceleration to $\\pm x$ plasma motion, NO$^+$ to NO$^*$ charge exchange dissipates electron thermal energy. This redistribution of energy released in the avalanche of the Rydberg gas to plasma, causes the ellipsoidal Rydberg gas to bifurcate \\cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}, forming very long-lived, separating charged-particle distributions. We capture the electron signal from these recoiling volumes on an imaging detector as pictured in Figure \\ref{fig:bifurcation}. Here, momentum matching preserves density and enables ions and Rydberg molecules to relax to positions that minimize potential energy, building spatial correlation. The semi-classical description of avalanche and relaxation outlined above forms an important point of reference from which to interpret our experimental observations. The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution. This initial condition has an evident effect on the evolution dynamics. We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma using a realistic, ellipsoidal representation of the ion/electron and Rydberg densities \\cite{haenelCP}. No combination of initial conditions can produce a simulation that conforms classically with the state of arrested relaxation we observe experimentally. \\subsection{A molecular ultracold plasma state of arrested relaxation} Thus, we find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydberg molecules in the wings of the ellipsoid quenches the ion-Rydberg molecule relative velocity distribution.",
      "This causes mixing with core penetrating states that are strongly dissociative. Penning partners are thus very likely to dissociate, leaving a spatially isolated distribution of ions. We refer to the spatial correlation that results as a Penning lattice \\cite{Sadeghi:2014}. The extent of this effect varies depending on the local density and the selected initial principal quantum number. Figure \\ref{fig:PL} shows the degree to which Rydberg gases with initial principal quantum numbers from 30 to 80 form a Penning lattice for an initial density of $1 \\times 10^{12} ~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$.  \n\n\\subsection{Spontaneous electron-impact avalanche}\n\nThe electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization start an electron impact avalanche. The kinetics of this process are well described by a set of coupled rate equations that account for state-to-state electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering, electron-impact ionization and three-body ion-electron recombination \\cite{PPR,Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling} using detailed rate coefficients,  $k_{ij}$, $k_{i,ion}$ and $k_{i,tbr}$ validated by MD simulations \\cite{PVS}. \\begin{eqnarray}\n-\\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt}&=&\\sum_{j}{k_{ij}\\rho_e\\rho_i}-\\sum_{j}{k_{ji}\\rho_e\\rho_j} \\nonumber\\\\\n&& +k_{i,ion}\\rho_e\\rho_i-k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e \n  \\label{level_i}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\noindent and,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\rho_e}{dt}=\\sum_{i}{k_{i,ion}\\rho_e^2}-\\sum_{i}{k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e}\n  \\label{electron}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe relaxation of Rydberg molecules balances with collisional ionization to determine an evolving temperature of avalanche electrons to conserve total energy per unit volume. \\begin{equation}\nE_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2}k_BT_e(t)\\rho_e(t)-R\\sum_i{\\frac{\\rho_i(t)}{n_i^2}},\n  \\label{energy}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, for simplicity, we neglect the longer-time effects of Rydberg predissociation and electron-ion dissociative recombination \\cite{Saquet2012}. Such calculations show that the conversion from Rydberg gas to plasma occurs on a timescale determined largely by the local Penning electron density, or Penning fraction, $P_f = \\rho_e/\\rho_0$, which depends on the local density of Rydberg molecules and their initial principal quantum number."

      "Social Shadowing\n\nCritics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory. The agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination. This tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions. Discussion\n\nBy using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication. The emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents.",
      "Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information. We show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication. In order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues. We interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination. The social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing. The idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios. In real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch.",
      "However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'. INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination. In humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination. Especially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations . However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication.",
      "In this setting, the communication may be bootstrapped, since our optimal critic has examples with strong signals from the 'social shadowing' episodes. Additionally, we show that the minimization of our independence objective enables tokens that contain minimal overlapping information with other tokens. Preventing trivial communication paradigms enables higher performance. Each of these objectives is complementary, so they are not trivially minimized during training, which is a substantial advantage over comparative baselines. Unlike prior work, this enables the benefits of training with reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings. In addition to lower sample complexity, the mutual information regularization yields additional benefits, such as small messages, which enables the compression aspect of sparse communication. From a qualitative point of view, the independent information also yields discrete emergent concepts, which can be further made human-interpretable by a post-hoc analysis . This is a step towards white-box machine learning in multi-agent settings. The interpretability of this learned white-box method could be useful in human-agent teaming as indicated by prior work . The work here will enable further results in decision-making from high-dimensional data with emergent concepts. The social scenarios described are a step towards enabling a zero-shot communication policy. This work will serve as future inspiration for using emergent communication to enable ad-hoc teaming with both agents and humans. Appendix\n\nA.1. Proofs Proposition 4.1 For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: Proof. Starting with the independent information objective, we want to minimize the interaction information, which defines the conditional mutual information between each token and, Let π i m (m l |h) be a variational approximation of p(m l |h), which is defined by our message encoder network. Given that each token should provide unique information, we assume independence between m l ."

      "But that’s what a constitutional default rule is. The Court has allowed Congress to overturn its dormant commerce clause cases since 1891.71× 71. See In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545, 560–62 (1891). Dormant commerce clause cases are not the only constitutional default rules. Professor Laurence Tribe’s treatise identifies two others.72× 72. 1 Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 6-35 (3d ed. 2000). And in a groundbreaking article, Professor Henry Monaghan revealed “a substructure of substantive, procedural, and remedial rules” forming “a constitutional common law subject to amendment, modification, or even reversal by Congress.”73× 73. Henry P. Monaghan, The Supreme Court, 1974 Term — Foreword: Constitutional Common Law, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 2–3 (1975); see also Susan R. Klein, Identifying and (Re)Formulating Prophylactic Rules, Safe Harbors, and Incidental Rights in Constitutional Criminal Procedure, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1030 (2001) (further developing Monaghan’s theory in criminal procedure context). What follows is a list of six lines of cases beyond the dormant commerce clause that may be fairly described as constitutional default rules. The first two are drawn from Tribe’s treatise while the next four are found in Monaghan’s article:\n(1) State Taxation of Federal Instrumentalities: States may not tax instrumentalities of the federal government74× 74. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819). — unless Congress consents.75× 75. See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 411 n.1 (1938) (“Congress may curtail an immunity which might otherwise be implied or enlarge it beyond the point where, Congress being silent, the Court would set its limits.” (citations omitted)). One court has described such judicial decisions as setting a “constitutional default rule.” United States v. Delaware, 958 F.2d 555, 560 n.9 (3d Cir. 1992) (“[W]e must decide the constitutional default rule for this type of tax, fully aware that Congress could decide at any time to reverse our decision statutorily.”).",
      "whether or not Congress can or will act. ”5× 5. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97. Emerging from Wayfair is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine. Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress’s practical ability to fix the problem. Ominous, because the Court’s logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause. Wayfair grants only feeble stare decisis to precedents that set a “constitutional default rule,”6× 6. Id. at 2096 (“While . . . Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.”). meaning constitutional decisions that allow for legislative adjustment or override. This new stare decisis analysis makes other precedents setting constitutional default rules more vulnerable — including, perhaps, mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona7× 7. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). and Mapp v. Ohio.8× 8. 367 U.S. 643 (1961). Since its 1967 decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue,9× 9. 386 U.S. 753 (1967). the Court has held that, under the “dormant” or “negative” implication of the Commerce Clause,10× 10. The dormant or negative commerce clause is a judicial derivation from the Commerce Clause “prohibiting States from discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval,” which “strikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.” Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015). states may not compel remote sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes.11× 11. See Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 759–60. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,12× 12. 504 U.S. 298 (1992). the Court refused to overrule the “bright-line, physical-presence requirement” of Bellas Hess, leaning heavily on stare decisis.13× 13. Id. at 317–18. Three Justices joined a concurrence explaining that their decision rested solely “on the basis of stare decisis.”",
      "See supra p. 278. The Court even insisted that to do so “is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role,” since Quill embodied “a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation. ”57× 57. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096 (emphasis added). This refusal breaks from the practical Brandeisian wisdom that has guided the Court’s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century. The point is not that stare decisis should have ultimately propped up Bellas Hess yet again, as Wayfair’s dissenting Justices maintained. After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch’s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill. In this vein, the Court could have sensibly pointed out that Congress is unlikely to stick its neck out with a tax hike (or a look-alike) from which only the states would benefit.58× 58. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Brian Galle, Essay, Kill Quill, Keep the Dormant Commerce Clause: History’s Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70 Stan. L. Rev. Online 158, 160–62 (2018), https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/70-Stan.-L.-Rev.-Online-158-Galle.pdf [https://perma.cc/22YP-P4V5]; Edward A. Zelinsky, The Political Process Argument for Overruling Quill, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 1177, 1191–92 (2017). Indeed, South Dakota advanced such practical arguments in its brief.59× 59. See Petitioner’s Brief at 54, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress has little incentive to act here because it would be (or appear to be) authorizing new or greater tax collections from its constituents, while receiving none of the revenue in return.”). More generally, the Court might have discussed the limits of the states’ influence in the federal system as a reason not to wait for congressional intervention, a topic it has debated on other occasions.60× 60. See Richard H. Pildes, Institutional Formalism and Realism in Constitutional and Public Law, 2013 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30–32; see also Galle, supra note 58, at 159 (“Congress is not a trustworthy guardian of state fiscal power, making continuing judicial involvement a more appealing prospect.”)."

Remark 2: Due to the modular nature of the proposed framework, the behavior planning module detailed in Section III-B can work with advanced maneuver-based (e.g.\nMarkov Chain ) and interaction-based (e.g. Social Generative Adversarial Networks ) trajectory prediction modules, allowing for interactive maneuvering behaviors. Speed and Lane Advisory System\n\nThe goal of our behavior planning module, Speed and Lane Advisory System or in short, SLAS, is to determine a sequence of speed and lane change commands that would enable the ego vehicle to maximize its speed, thus minimizing the travel time, while accounting for driver comfort and abiding by its dynamical, actuator, and safety limits. The output of this module is a relatively smooth speed and lane change profile which is then passed on to a motion planner. It is necessary to incorporate the dynamical and actuator limits in the behavioral planning module so as not to provide the motion planner with goals that are not reachable, and jeopardize the safety of the overall system as a result. In the subsequent discussion, we provide a formulation of the optimization problem for SLAS; highlight the modifications necessary to improve the computational complexity; and, present safety and feasibility analysis. 1) Optimization Problem with Integer Constraints: SLAS is posed as an optimization problem, with the objective to maximize speed while minimizing frequent lane changes and abrupt changes in speed. The output of SLAS, at time instant k, is the control input u 0 (k + 1), as defined in . The optimization problem is formulated as follows: Objective Function: In the formulation above, the optimization variables are the ego vehicle's speed (v k (j)) and target lane (L k (j)), j step into the future, starting from time instant k.\nHere, H corresponds to the planning horizon.",
      "The state (x 0 (k)) and control input (u 0 (k)) to the system at time instant k are defined as: where V m denotes the maximum speed of the ego vehicle. Observation Model\n\nFor practical considerations, we restrict the ego vehicle's visibility range to the sensory perception limit, denoted by R v . Then, the set of vehicles in ego vehicle's visibility range at time instant k, represented by O(k), is defined as: where s i (k) corresponds to the longitudinal displacement of the observed vehicle. Remark 1: For the multi-lane highway driving scenario, occlusion does not play a prominent role so we do not account for it in the existing formulation. However, the proposed framework can easily accommodate occlusion and measurement uncertainties since the receding horizon approach bases its decision on the most up-to-date information available at any given time, as demonstrated in . In this section, we describe the prediction model to generate the predicted future trajectories of observed vehicles and present a discussion on the proposed receding horizon optimization-based behavioral planning module. Trajectory Prediction\n\nReliable behavior and trajectory prediction of other traffic participants is crucial for safe maneuvering of autonomous vehicles. The algorithm proposed in Section III-B is able to incorporate any generic prediction module available in the literature as long as it can provide a deterministic predicted future trajectory for a given vehicle. In this work, we formulate a low-complexity prediction model that highlights the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed approach. For an observed vehicle i ∈ O(k), the future speed profile is predicted using a piece-wise linear function while the lane profile is assumed to stay constant for the duration of the prediction horizon. At a given time step k, the estimated acceleration (ā k i ) and the estimated speed (v k i ) parameters are obtained through linear regression with mean-squared error on the past o k i > 1 speed observations."

      "You certainly have with me in your comment about asking for comments for the Cyberspace era from presidential candidates. I have very strong reactions to that. I think that I am going to try to express them, as a pure statement, or maybe an actual story. Several years ago, I was discussing with a friend of mine the current presidential, the then-current presidential election. He was asking me why I wasn't rabidly supporting Jesse Jackson. I thought about it, and my first response was, \"Well, let's talk about the other candidates for a second. What about -- and I'll take a random name -- Michael Dukakis?\" And my friend looked at me and said, \"Michael Dukakis, he's just an administrator, he's not a visionary.\" I thought about it, and I said, \"Hold on, I'm an American, I'm not someone who's a slave of the Queen of England, or something like that. I'm my own visionary, I decide where I am going.\" I don't want the politicians walking around telling me that I am going to have an expressway system that's going to pave over all my favorite swamps to play in. I don't want the politicians walking around defining what I'm going to do in my life. I want to elect politicians to manage government for me, to provide the barest minimum necessities to keep us smoothly greased as individuals in living together, and I want those politicians to be of the people, and I don't want them to tell me what my opinions should be. Finally, I want to cap that off with when we have government deciding how our systems work for us, we can then end up with situations where we can say, \"Oh yeah, that IRS guy or that government net guy, he was just doing his job when he banned cryptography,\" or something like that. That's not the sort of world that I want to live in. I want to live in a world, where each of us defines our little space in it. Thank you all.

      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",

Or wouldn't you bother at all?\nDYSON: Does he want to get elected, or does he want to make a point? LIASSON: I think he wants to make a point. If he wants to get elected, I think the discussion would stop right now. DYSON: Let me just try a serious answer. I think what a candidate could say is, \"I'm no longer going to protect the textile industry, the peanut butter interests, the sugar guys, the antediluvian steel mills. If I'm going to have an industrial policy and help anyone, it's going to be new technology. I'm going to focus on investment in R&D. I am going to create a national infrastructure for telecommunications, just the way we created a highway system years ago. I'm going to put people to work doing these things.\" I think that would go over reasonably well. I think it's something most of us would agree on. (laughter) We have an industrial policy -- we might as well acknowledge it, and we might as well have it be forward-looking.\nKAPOR: Now there is something about the question as to whether this is presidential material that I think is ironic, given that most people really want to vote for \"none of the above.\" We know in our hearts that we have come to a particular period in history in which the presidential spectacle seems to be particularly irrelevant to whatever set of problems we have on our minds. As a great believer in democracy, I think this is incredibly lamentable. We need to do something about this, because there are a lot of issues, but Cyberspace is not ready for prime time. It would be trivialized -- I have seen what Geraldo did to hackers, and I don't need to see any more.

He is an information policy writer and thinker who recently opened his own public policy writing firm here in Washington -- it's called Executive Ink, not Inc., as it is written in your programs, so you can scratch that out. Esther Dyson, at the end of the panel, is among the most respected commentators on developing technology trends in the personal computer business. She publishes two newsletters, Release 1.0 and Rel-EAST. She has also been one of the driving forces promoting East-West relations through computer networks. She is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation as well. I'll ask Peter to start. P. DENNING: Thank you. Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their governments to regulate commerce, erase inequities, and build societies of better human beings. For over a hundred years, many people, from peasants to intellectuals, had faith that strong governments would bring them a better life. This faith was part of the clearing in which Communist governments flourished; although the United States took an anti-Communist stand, the same faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by great national programs including Social Security, welfare, food stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society. This faith is now shattered. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life. The dramatic collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people for federal, state, and local governments. The poor track record of government is not the only reason for the shift. Information technology has accelerated the process. Communications that took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions. Radio, TV, fax, and now E-mail are common worldwide, so much so that not even a powerful government can control what information its citizens have.",
      "DYSON: There aren't enough women in politics for there to be any evil ones. WARREN: Well, I am sure that I can find some evil ones for you. (laughter) Anyway, to the main points: I would say that we are not so much elite, in that we are open to anyone who takes the initiative to join us, and many of us are active mentors in trying to get others to join us. I would say simply that we are a minority, and it occurs to me that revolution has always been a minority activity. It was not millions of Russians who opposed the attempted coup several months ago. It was ten, twenty, or thirty thousand in Moscow, with the aid of communications. It was not a massive movement, a populist movement, in America that resisted the Crown, two centuries ago. It was a small minority of activists and we are the activists here -- we are the revolutionaries. Freedom has always been a do-it-yourself activity, but the key syllable in that word activity is act. Let us reaffirm freedom of speech, press, assembly, security against undue search and seizure -- the basic constitutional freedoms and privileges. Let us demand that our politicians and our political candidates do the same in explicit formal commitments to act in behalf of protecting electronic civil liberties, just as they validate and speak favorably for traditional civil liberties. We can write our politicians, write our candidates and say, \"Take a position in favor of civil liberties, regardless of the technology of the moment.\" Thank you. GLENN TENNEY: Thank you for the introduction, Jim. LIASSON: Are you from the IRS?\nTENNEY: No. (laughter) My name is Glenn Tenney, and I have a question for you, Mara. I think that I have enough supporters on the panel. I'm not too curious about their views, but they are welcome to them. You questioned if the presidential election and race is ready for Cyberspace.

      "Because of his stops in Cincinnati and growing up in northeast Ohio, Narduzzi has ties to our important midwest recruiting territories. What I like most about him as a candidate is his time at Rhode Island. I don't think our new head coach needs ties to BC, but I do think it helps if he comes in with an understanding of what BC is and can be. If you've coached at URI, you know what New England football is like. You know about the difference in fan interest and the space crunch BC is under. And you'll know that BC can be successful with the right coaching. What to Watch for in 2012: How high Narduzzi's profile rises. He interviewed for head coaching jobs last year. If Michigan State continues to improve and Narduzzi earns more accolades, other schools will have interest. Mark Stoops\nDefensive Coordinator, Florida State Normally I would worry about the fit of a guy like Stoops. He's coming from a football factory. His last name brings some good and bad baggage. But I do think there are some strong pluses in his candidacy at BC. Like Narduzzi, Stoops has deep ties to the Ohio Catholic high school circuit. He also has a good understanding of the ACC landscape after stops in Miami and Florida State. His FSU defenses still begin with the 4-3, so he could take our current roster and install his own system. Although the Stoops name isn't a household name in Boston, his track record, name and personality would be an easy sell to the BC faithful. What to Watch for in 2012: How Florida State handles their expectations. If this is the year they finally return to being \"Florida State\" Stoops will get much of the credit and be a hot name. Even if they are good, not great, he's still viable at BC. Defensive Coordinator, Texas\nDue to his unusual path into coaching and his sudden rise, Diaz is a very hot name among coordinators. Aside from his time coaching at other ACC schools, there's not much tying him to BC. But I think his ability to recruit, his Xs and Os and the ability to be the face of the program deserve consideration.",
      "If Wisconsin keeps up their recent success will he emerge as a candidate elsewhere? Bill Lazor\nOffensive Coordinator, Virginia\nLazor's been a good coordinator at Virginia. He's not changing the game but they've been better than they were before he got there and they've been consistent. Lazor's ACC experience -- especially at a school like UVA -- translates well to BC (as it did for TOB years ago). He can also sell his NFL ties to recruits. He played at Cornell and is from Scranton, so geography and academics wouldn't be an issue. What to Watch for in 2012: How will UVA handle their pending QB controversy. Will they also move up within the ACC or stay middle of the pack offensively? Offensive Coordinator, Alabama\nNussmeier moves from Washington to being the playcaller at the Defending National Champions. He's got a good profile for a rising coach in that he played professionally, coached in college, the NFL and Canada, and is now at an elite program. He runs a pro-style west coast offense, so the transition to BC would be relatively easy. Nussmeier lacks any obvious ties to BC or the northeast. What to Watch in 2012: How will Nussmeier adjust to the pressure cooker of Saban and Alabama? Saban's offensives have been bland but effective. I expect more of the same this year. It doesn't make for compelling football but working for Saban can be good training for future head coaches. Labels: Bill Lazor, Chad Morris, Coaches to Watch, fire Spaz, Matt Canada\nICYMI: Links from the past week\nPhil Steele thinks we will score more points this season. Kevin Pierre-Louis was named to the Nagurski watch list. Pennsylvania Tight End strongly considered BC but verballed to UConn instead. BC's interest seemed to fade as other Tight Ends/Defensive Ends committed. Temple closed on Jersey prospect Jarred Alwan. That's a big coup considering how hard BC went after him. Former Eagle Steve Hailey now coaches on the Boston AAU circuit. Maybe that will help us with local talent. BC still has interest in Ohio RB Keith Watkins.",
      "Chris Pantale is on the Mackey watch list. The award is given annually to the country's best Tight End. Beaver Country Day big man Jacquil Taylor is generating local interest. BC has yet to offer, but is following him. BCeagles.com posted a Q&A with Bobby Swiggert yesterday. I found his talk about paring down the offense encouraging. We need to work on execution not diversity of plays. HD put out this offseason filler piece ranking coaching jobs in the ACC. I don't really care where she perceives us. When the job changes we will be very attractive to the right guy for us. Labels: Bobby Swigert, Chris Pantale, emmett cleary, Heather Dinich, Kaleb Ramsey, Links, Recruiting, Truman Gutapfel\nWhere is the one that got away? While we've struggled recruiting Massachusetts players this year, we've cleaned up in Connecticut and in Ohio. Those local kids (or other lay-up recruits) we miss generate plenty of frustration but they happen every year. What's fortunate about our misses though, is that very few have come back to haunt us. When was the last time a great recruit spurned BC and became a star? I can think of a few over the years, but most of the recruits that \"got away\" had middling careers elsewhere. Some recent examples of guys who spurned us include Graham Stewart, Arthur Lynch and Joe Boisture. All three committed to BC at one point only to rethink their decisions and go to bigger programs. Stewart washed out at Florida and is now sitting out a transfer year at UConn. Boisture is out of football altogether. Lynch has been a backup at Georgia. He has a chance for a bigger role this season, but so far has not lived up to the hype that surrounded his recruitment. Even with our terrible offense, Chris Pantale has had a much more productive Tight End career. The closest thing I can think of to a recent recruit who had success elsewhere is Virginia OT Oday Aboushi. But should he even count? He didn't spurn BC. Our admissions office turned him down after he verbaled to BC. Prior to that, you would have to go back to Dorian Bryant."

      "For example, the media application (e.g., media application 206 (FIG. 2)) may have determined the context of event 106. Specifically, the media application may determine via a content-recognition module or algorithm the words spoken and/or actions by the person during the event. Additionally or alternatively, the media application may analyze the words and/or action during a predetermined amount of time (e.g., ten seconds) before and/or after the event (e.g., in order to better understand the context of the event). Furthermore, by cross-referencing the words and/or other information obtained by the content-recognition module (e.g., as discussed below in relation to FIG. 5) with a database, the content-recognition module determines that the term “we,” the person in the media asset refers to an organization or body. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “export” refers to shipping goods out of a country. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “a lot” refers to a particular numerical amount. Finally, the content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “coal” refers to a mineral of fossilized carbon. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine the relationships between words and/or other information obtained by the content-recognition module. For example, by processing the relationship between the words, the media application determines that event 106 is a statement regarding a particular amount of a particular substance shipped out of a particular country. Therefore, the media application determines that the request for supplemental information is likely a request to determine the validity of the statement. The media application then generates the supplemental information. The media application may also have stored supplemental information generated by previous requests (e.g., supplemental information generated in response to the same or different user viewing the media asset at an earlier date), and display the supplemental information again during the event (either in response to a user input requesting supplemental information or automatically without a user requesting supplemental information).",
      "Moreover, the use of general search terms may not provide the accuracy or precision needed by the user. Furthermore, even if a user may eventually determine the information, the effort and time required may distract the user from the media asset. Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event in a media asset and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The context-recognition module prevents the user from being distracted from the media asset (e.g., while the user attempts to describe the context of the event or search for information about the event). In addition, by distributing tasks to multiple entities (e.g., crowd-sourcing), the media application may collect large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time (or in real-time) and aggregate and/or filter the information to generate the supplemental information about the event based on multiple viewpoints and/or sources. By using multiple viewpoints and/or sources, the media application enhances the completeness (e.g., by providing unbiased information) and accuracy of the supplemental information. For example, when a statement or action is made by a character or person appearing on a media asset (e.g., a television program), a user may request supplemental information about the statement or action. In response, the media application may determine the context of the statement (e.g., who said the statement and to what the statement was referring) or action (e.g., what was the reason for the action). After determining the context of the statement or action, the media application may itemize into tasks the additional information it requires in order to generate the supplemental information. The media application may then transmit requests including the tasks to a plurality of other users.",
      "Based on the responses from the plurality of other users, the media application may generate the supplemental information for display to the user. In some embodiments, a media application may use multiple types of content-recognition modules and/or algorithms to determine the context of an event. For example, the media application may process data associated with the event in order to determine the context of an event. In some embodiments, processing the various types of data may include cross-referencing the data in a database indicating the different contexts the event may have. In some embodiments, a media application may generate supplemental information about an event in a media asset in response to a user request. In order to generate the supplemental information, the media application may transmit, to multiple users, a request for additional information regarding a context of an event shown in a media asset. Upon receiving messages from the plurality of users that include the requested additional information, the media application may generate the supplemental information associated with the context of the event based on the messages. It should be noted, the systems and/or methods described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods and/or apparatuses.\nFIG. 9 is a flowchart of illustrative steps for generating supplemental information based on additional information provided by a plurality of users in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. The methods and systems described herein alleviate the need for a user to determine the proper context (e.g., who said a statement, what was the tone of the statement, when was the statement said, etc.) of an event in a media asset, or the search terms to use to describe the event (e.g., the proper search terms to describe the tone of the statement), in order to determine more information about the event.",
      "For example, the media application may receive media assets in the form of a video. The video may include a series of frames. For each frame of the video, the media application may use a content-recognition module or algorithm to determine the context (e.g., the person that is speaking or a facial gesture affirming or denying a statement) of an event occurring during the frame or series of frames. In some embodiments, the content-recognition module or algorithm may also include speech recognition techniques, including but not limited to Hidden Markov Models, dynamic time warping, and/or neural networks (as described above) to translate spoken words into text. The content-recognition module may also use other techniques for processing audio and/or visual data. For example, the media application may monitor the volume of a statement in a media asset to determine the tone of the statement (e.g., a high volume may indicate an angry tone). In addition, the media application may use multiple types of optical character recognition and/or fuzzy logic, for example, when determining the context of a keyword(s) retrieved from data (e.g., media data, translated audio data, subtitle data, user-generated data, etc.) associated with the media asset (or when cross-referencing various types of data with databases indicating the different contexts of events as described below). For example, the particular data field may be a textual data field. Using fuzzy logic, the system may determine two fields and/or values to be identical even though the substance of the data field or value (e.g., two different spellings) is not identical. In some embodiments, the system may analyze particular data fields of a data structure or media asset frame for particular values or text. The data fields could be associated with characteristics, additional information, and/or any other data required for the function of the embodiments described herein. Furthermore, the data fields could contain values (e.g., the data fields could be expressed in binary or any other suitable code or programming language).",
      "For example, media application may aggregate, append, and/or compare the additional information in each of the messages received from the plurality of users. The supplemental information may then be generated based on the aggregated, appended, and/or compared additional information (e.g., as described in FIG. 9 below). In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive summary information about the event with the request for additional information. (e.g., a video clip of a portion or segment of the media asset, a textual description, etc.), which may help the plurality of users provide additional information. For example, in some embodiments, the media application may instead of (or in addition to) determining the context of an event, determine a particular portion of the event that would be needed for the plurality of users to provide additional information about the event. For example, the media application may use progress information associated with the progress of the media asset (e.g., line 506 (FIG. 5)) to determine at what point during the progression of the media asset the event occurred, and in response, transmit a portion of the media asset beginning ten second before that point and ending ten seconds after that point. For example, if the event is a statement made by a character or person in a media asset, the media application may determine when the statement began (e.g., the point of progress of the media asset in which the statement began) and ended. The media application may then include the portion containing the entire statement (and the event) in the request for additional information sent to the plurality of users. The selected portion may include any amount of summary information that the media application determines is necessary for the user or any one of the plurality of users to understand the main action sequence. This summary information (e.g., a portion of the media asset) may be included with the request for additional information (e.g., in a file transmitted with the request), or may be included with the generated supplemental information as a reference for the user."

      "Hemoglobin electrophoresis — A laboratory test that separates molecules based on their size, shape, or electrical charge. Hepatomegaly — An abnormally large liver. HLA type — Refers to the unique set of proteins called human leukocyte antigens. These proteins are present on each individual's cell and allow the immune system to recognize 'self' from 'foreign'. HLA type is particularly important in organ and tissue transplantation. Hydroxyurea — A drug that has been shown to induce production of fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin has a pair of gamma-globin molecules in place of the typical beta-globins of adult hemoglobin. Higher-than-normal levels of fetal hemoglobin can ameliorate some of the symptoms of thalassemia. Iron overload — A side effect of frequent blood transfusions in which the body accumulates abnormally high levels of iron. Iron deposits can form in organs, particularly the heart, and cause life-threatening damage. Jaundice — Yellowing of the skin or eyes due to excess of bilirubin in the blood. Mutation — A permanent change in the genetic material that may alter a trait or characteristic of an individual, or manifest as disease, and can be transmitted to offspring. Placenta — The organ responsible for oxygen and nutrition exchange between a pregnant mother and her developing baby. Red blood cell — Hemoglobin-containing blood cells that transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues. In the tissues, the red blood cells exchange their oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is brought back to the lungs to be exhaled. Screening — Process through which carriers of a trait may be identified within a population. Splenomegaly — Enlargement of the spleen. Because alpha thalassemia major is most often a condition that is fatal in the prenatal or newborn period, treatment has previously been focused on identifying affected pregnancies in order to provide appropriate management to reduce potential maternal complications. Pregnancy termination provides one form of management. Increased prenatal surveillance and early treatment of maternal complications is an approach that is appropriate for mothers who wish to continue their pregnancy with the knowledge that the baby will most likely not survive.",
      "Therefore, hemoglobin E is unique in that it is both a quantitative (i.e. thalassemia-like) and qualitative trait. When co-inherited with a beta thalassemia trait, it causes a disease that is almost indistinguishable from beta thalassemia disease. Large deletions around and including the beta globin gene can lead to delta/beta thalassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Interestingly, delta/beta thalassemia trait behaves very similarly to beta thalassemia trait in its clinical manifestations. However, HPFH trait does not tend to cause hemoglobin disease when co-inherited with a second thalassemia or other beta globin mutation. ALPHA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have four normal copies of the alpha globin gene, two copies on each chromosome 16. These genes make the alpha globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, which is called hemoglobin A. Alpha globin is also a component of fetal hemoglobin and the other major adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin A2. Mutations of the alpha globin genes are usually deletions of the gene, resulting in absent production of alpha globin. Since there are four genes (instead of the usual two) to consider when looking at alpha globin gene inheritance, there are several alpha globin types that are possible. Absence of one alpha globin gene leads to a condition known as silent alpha thalassemia trait. This condition causes no health problems and can be detected only by special genetic testing. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs when two alpha globin genes are missing. This can occur in two ways. The genes may be deleted from the same chromosome, causing the 'cis' type of alpha thalassemia trait. Alternately, they may be deleted from different chromosomes, causing the 'trans' type of alpha thalassemia trait. In both instances, there are no associated health problems, although the trait status may be detected by more routine blood screening. Hemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of three alpha globin genes, such that there is only one functioning gene.",
      "Thalassemia may be suspected if an individual shows signs that are suggestive of the disease. In all cases, however, laboratory diagnosis is essential to confirm the exact diagnosis and to allow for the provision of accurate genetic counseling about recurrence risks and testing options for parents and affected individuals. Screening is likewise recommended to determine trait status for individuals of high-risk ethnic groups. The following tests are used to screen for thalassemia disease and/or trait:\nhemoglobin electrophoresis with quantitative hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F\nfree erythrocyte-protoporphyrin (or ferritin or other studies of serum iron levels) A complete blood count will identify low levels of hemoglobin, small red blood cells, and other red blood cell abnormalities that are characteristic of a thalassemia diagnosis. Since thalassemia trait can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from iron deficiency, tests to evaluate iron levels are important. A hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that can help identify the types and quantities of hemoglobin made by an individual. This test uses an electric field applied across a slab of gel-like material. Hemoglobins migrate through this gel at various rates and to specific locations, depending on their size, shape, and electrical charge. Isoelectric focusing and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) use similar principles to separate hemoglobins and can be used instead of or in various combinations with hemoglobin electrophoresis to determine the types and quantities of hemoglobin present. Hemoglobin electrophoresis results are usually within the normal range for all types of alpha thalassemia. However, hemoglobin A2 levels and sometimes hemoglobin F levels are elevated when beta thalassemia disease or trait is present. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can also detect structurally abnormal hemoglobins that may be co-inherited with a thalassemia trait to cause thalassemia disease (i.e., hemoglobin E) or other types of hemoglobin disease (i.e., sickle hemoglobin)."

      "Adrienne R. Niederriter, Erica E. Davis, Christelle Golzio, Edwin C. Oh, I-Chun Tsai, Nicholas Katsanis. Institutions: Duke University Medical Center, Duke University, Duke University Medical Center. Here, we present methods for the development of assays to query potentially clinically significant nonsynonymous changes using in vivo complementation in zebrafish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a useful animal system due to their experimental tractability; embryos are transparent to enable facile viewing, undergo rapid development ex vivo, and can be genetically manipulated.1 These aspects have allowed for significant advances in the analysis of embryogenesis, molecular processes, and morphogenetic signaling. Taken together, the advantages of this vertebrate model make zebrafish highly amenable to modeling the developmental defects in pediatric disease, and in some cases, adult-onset disorders. Because the zebrafish genome is highly conserved with that of humans (~70% orthologous), it is possible to recapitulate human disease states in zebrafish. This is accomplished either through the injection of mutant human mRNA to induce dominant negative or gain of function alleles, or utilization of morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides to suppress genes to mimic loss of function variants. Through complementation of MO-induced phenotypes with capped human mRNA, our approach enables the interpretation of the deleterious effect of mutations on human protein sequence based on the ability of mutant mRNA to rescue a measurable, physiologically relevant phenotype. Modeling of the human disease alleles occurs through microinjection of zebrafish embryos with MO and/or human mRNA at the 1-4 cell stage, and phenotyping up to seven days post fertilization (dpf). This general strategy can be extended to a wide range of disease phenotypes, as demonstrated in the following protocol. We present our established models for morphogenetic signaling, craniofacial, cardiac, vascular integrity, renal function, and skeletal muscle disorder phenotypes, as well as others.",
      "Unlike most established human glioblastoma cell line xenografts, injection of transformed GEM-derived cortical astrocytes into the brains of immune-competent littermates produced astrocytomas, including the most aggressive subtype, glioblastoma, that recapitulated the histopathological hallmarks of human astrocytomas, including diffuse invasion of normal brain parenchyma. Bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic allografts from transformed astrocytes engineered to express luciferase was utilized to monitor in vivo tumor growth over time. Thus, astrocytoma models using astrocytes and NSC harvested from GEM with conditional oncogenic alleles provide an integrated system to study the genetics and cell biology of astrocytoma pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and may be useful in preclinical drug development for these devastating diseases.

Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University. Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation.",

Institutions: University of Wuerzburg, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich. Visualization of calcium dynamics is important to understand the role of calcium in cell physiology. To examine calcium dynamics, synthetic fluorescent Ca2+ indictors have become popular. Here we demonstrate TED (= targeted-esterase induced dye loading), a method to improve the release of Ca2+ indicator dyes in the ER lumen of different cell types. To date, TED was used in cell lines, glial cells, and neurons in vitro. TED bases on efficient, recombinant targeting of a high carboxylesterase activity to the ER lumen using vector-constructs that express Carboxylesterases (CES). The latest TED vectors contain a core element of CES2 fused to a red fluorescent protein, thus enabling simultaneous two-color imaging. The dynamics of free calcium in the ER are imaged in one color, while the corresponding ER structure appears in red. At the beginning of the procedure, cells are transduced with a lentivirus. Subsequently, the infected cells are seeded on coverslips to finally enable live cell imaging. Then, living cells are incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester (AM-ester) form of low-affinity Ca2+ indicators, for instance Fluo5N-AM, Mag-Fluo4-AM, or Mag-Fura2-AM. The esterase activity in the ER cleaves off hydrophobic side chains from the AM form of the Ca2+ indicator and a hydrophilic fluorescent dye/Ca2+ complex is formed and trapped in the ER lumen. After dye loading, the cells are analyzed at an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope.",
      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells. Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1–3 μM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4–16 mM), either alone or in combination for 24–48 h, compared to full medium. Mean ± SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments.

PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 μM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively. Specifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown).",
      "Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 . These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic “parasites” anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming \"endogenized\" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements. HeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere."

      "Lastly, we find that the trends in power-law exponents usually point to mixed directions, and that large price variations are likely to become less frequent only in about 28% of the cryptocurrencies as they age and grow in market capitalization. Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008 , various different cryptoassets have been developed and are now considered to be at the cutting edge of innovation in finance . These digital financial assets are vastly diverse in design characteristics and intended purposes, ranging from peer-to-peer networks with underlying cash-like digital currencies (e.g.\nBitcoin) to general-purpose blockchains transacting in commodity-like digital assets (e.g. Ethereum), and even to cryptoassets that intend to replicate the price of conventional assets such as the US dollar or gold (e.g. Tether and Tether Gold) . With more than nine thousand cryptoassets as of 2022 , the total market value of cryptocurrencies has grown massively to a staggering $2 trillion peak in 2021 . Despite long-standing debates over the intrinsic value and legality of cryptoassets , or perhaps even precisely due to such controversies, it is undeniable that cryptocurrencies are increasingly attracting the attention of academics, investors, and central banks, around the world . Moreover, these digital assets have been at the forefront of sizable financial gains and losses in recent years , they have been recognized as the main drivers of the brand-new phenomena of cryptoart and NFTs , but also as facilitators of illegal activities, such as money laundering and dark trade . Financial research dedicated Our results are based on daily price time series of 7111 cryptocurrencies that comprise a significant part of all currently available cryptoassets (see Methods for details). From these price series, we have estimated their logarithmic returns 2/16 Log-return, r ). The black horizontal arrow represents a given position of the expanding time window (at t = 2004 days) used to sample the return series over the entire history of Bitcoin.",
      "Finally, the former levels are classified regarding whether the power-law exponents increase, decrease or have a mixed trend with the predictive variables. Overall, 36% of the associations are classified as mixed trends (green rectangles), 28% are increasing trends (blue rectangles), and 26% are decreasing trends (red rectangles). We have studied the distributions of large price variations of a significant part of the digital assets that currently comprise the entirety of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike previous work, we have estimated these distributions for entire historical price records of each digital currency, and we have identified the patterns under which the return distributions change as cryptoassets age and grow in market capitalization. Similarly to conventional financial assets , our findings show that the return distributions of the vast majority of cryptoassets have tails that are described well by power-law functions along their entire history. The typical power-law exponents of cryptocurrencies (α ∼ 3) are, however, significantly smaller than those reported for conventional assets (α ∼ 4) . This feature corroborates the widespread belief that cryptoassets are indeed considerably more risky for investments than stocks or other more traditional financial assets. Indeed, we have found that about half of the cryptocurrencies in our analysis do not have a characteristic scale for price variations, and are thus prone to much higher price variations than those typically observed in stock markets. On the upside, we have also identified an asymmetry in the power-law exponents for positive and negative returns in about 2/3 of all considered cryptocurrencies, such that these exponents are smaller for positive than they are for negative returns. This means that sizable positive price variations have generally been more likely to occur than equally sizable negative price variations, which in turn may also reflect the recent overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Using a hierarchical Bayesian linear model, we have also simultaneously investigated the overall market characteristics and asset-specific tendencies regarding the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents. We have found that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the trends exhibited by each cryptocurrency; however, only a small fraction of cryptocurrencies (10%) have power-law exponents neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. These associations have been mostly ignored by the current literature and are probably related to the still-early developmental stage of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Overall, 36% of cryptocurrencies present trends that do not systematically contribute to increasing or decreasing their power-law exponents as they age and grow in market capitalization. On the other hand, for 26% of cryptocurrencies, aging and growing market capitalization are both associated with a reduction in their power-law exponents, thus contributing to the rise in the frequency of large price variations in their dynamics. Only about 28% of cryptocurrencies present trends in which the power-law exponents increase with age and market capitalization, favoring thus large price variations to become less likely. These results somehow juxtapose with findings about the increasing informational efficiency of the cryptocurrency market . In fact, if on the one hand the cryptocurrency market is becoming more informationally efficient, then on the other our findings indicate that there is no clear trend toward decreasing the risks of sizable variations in the prices of most considered cryptoassets. In other words, risk and efficiency thus appear to be moving towards different directions in the cryptocurrency market. To conclude, we hope that our findings will contribute significantly to the better understanding of the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, and not just for a small subset of selected digital assets, which is especially relevant due to the diminishing concentration of market capitalization among the top digital currencies, and also because of the considerable impact these new assets may have in our increasingly digital economy.",
      "Beyond the previous discussion about whether positive or negative returns are simultaneously or individually affected by age and market capitalization, we have also categorized the direction of the trend imposed by these two quantities on the power-law exponents. Blue rectangles in Fig. represent the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a raise in the power-law exponents. About 28% of all cryptocurrencies exhibit this pattern in which large price variations are expected to occur less frequently as they grow and age. Conversely, the red rectangles in Fig. depict the fraction of relationships for which increasing age or market capitalization (or both) is associated with a reduction in the power-law exponents. This case comprises about 25% of all cryptocurrencies for which large price variations are likely to become more frequent as they grow in market capitalization and age. Still, the majority of associations represented by green rectangles refer to the case where the effects of age and market capitalization point in different directions (e.g. exponents increasing with age while decreasing with market capitalization). About 36% of cryptocurrencies fit this condition which in turn contributes to consolidating the cumbersome hierarchical structure of patterns displayed by cryptocurrencies regarding the dynamics of large price variations. This complex picture is not much different when considering only cryptocurrencies in the top 200 market capitalization rank (Supplementary Figure ). However, we do observe an increased prevalence of patterns characterized by exponents that rise with age and market capitalization (37%), suggesting that large price variations are becoming less frequent among the top 200 cryptocurrencies than in the overall market.\n). Each of the previous three levels is further classified regarding whether both positive and negative returns are simultaneously affected or whether the effect involves only positive or only negative returns."

    "question": "Given the described relationship between reward variance (σ) and learning rate (η p), under what specific environmental conditions would an agent, as described in the provided documentation, be most likely to evolve a learning rate of η p ≈ 0, effectively ceasing adaptation throughout its lifetime?",

    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small. Therefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ. This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. . Indeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues. A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ). This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment.",
      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.",
      "The qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ]. Thus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold. These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously. Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions. The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red). In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food."

      "Here we employ the Perceptual Hash algorithm (PHash) to remove those images. PHash has the special property that the hash value is dependent on the image content, and it remains approximately the same if the content is not significantly modified. Thus we can easily distinguish different scenarios and delete duplicate images within one scenario. After deduplicating, we obtain 7,782 images (6,671 images for training; 1,111 for testing). The retention rate of the new dataset is 95\\%, which means that there are only a few similar images in the new dataset. Figure \\ref{exam} shows that our dataset also retains various underwater scenes. \\subsection{Image Re-annotation}\nDue to the small size of objects and the blur underwater environment, there are always missing or wrong labels in the existing annotation files. In addition, some test sets' annotation files are not available and some datasets do not have the starfish annotation. In order to address these issues, we follow the next process which combines a CNN model and manual annotation to re-annotate these images. Specifically, we first train a detector (\\emph{i.e.,} GFL \\cite{li2020generalized}) with the originally labeled images. After that, the trained detector predicts all the 7,782 images. We treat the prediction as the groundtruth and use it to train the GFL again. We get the final GFL prediction called {\\bf the coarse annotation}. Next, we use manual correction to get the final annotation called {\\bf the fine annotation}. Notably, we adopt the COCO \\cite{Belongie2014} annotation form as the final format. \\subsection{Dataset Statistics}\n{\\bf The proportion of classes}: The total number of objects is 74,515. Holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish are 7,887, 50,156, 1,924, and 14,548, respectively. Figure \\ref{pie} shows the proportion of each creatures where echinus accounts for 67.3\\% of the total. The whole data distribution shows an obvious long-tail distribution because the different economic benefits of different seafoods determine the different breed quantities.",
      "In terms of the content of the dataset images, there are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. URPC2017 only retains 15\\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance. For other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \\emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness. Therefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). Besides, based on the MMDetection$\\protect\\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \\cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \\emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER$\\protect\\footnote{JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA which could be deployed in an underwater robot.",

      "69.1&\\bf 43.0&64.0\\\\\n\n\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table*} Therefore, in terms of accuracy, the accuracy difference between the multi- and the one- stage methods in AP is not obvious, and the AP$_{S}$ of different methods is always the lowest among the three size AP. For class AP, AP$_{Sc}$ lags significantly behind the other three classes because it has the smallest number of instances. In terms of efficiency, large parameters and FLOPs result in low FPS on AGX, with a maximum FPS of 7.4, which is hardly deployable on underwater robot. Finally, we also found that ResNet101 was not significantly improved over ResNet50, which means that a very deep network may not be useful for detecting small creatures in underwater scenarios. Consequently, the design of high accuracy and high efficiency detector is still the main direction in this field and there is still large space to improve the performance. In order to achieve this goal, a shallow backbone with strong multi-scale feature fusion ability can be proposed to extract the discriminant features of small scale aquatic organisms; a specially designed training strategy may overcome the DUO's long-tail distribution, such as a more reasonable positive/negative label sampling mechanism or a class-balanced image allocation strategy within a training batch.\n\n\\section{Conclusion} In this paper, we introduce a dataset (DUO) and a corresponding benchmark to fill in the gaps in the community. DUO contains a variety of underwater scenes and more reasonable annotations. Benchmark includes efficiency and accuracy indicators to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the \\emph{SOTA} decoders. The two contributions could serve as a reference for academic research and industrial applications, as well as promote community development."

Mara is Congressional correspondent for NPR, and covers activities in Congress in D.C. Right now, this week, she has been covering the tax bill, which people currently are going at hot and heavy. She took time off from her busy schedule to come here to help us sort out some of these key issues for today, and more importantly, for what happens in the next decade and beyond. I'll turn it over to Mara to get the panel going. LIASSON: Thank you very much. I am probably the only person here who has absolutely no background in technology. Anyway, I am the only one who does not understand what the panelists are going to be talking about (laughter), and although they have already told me that they do not appreciate people who think that that's a great quality and look down on people who are technical, and I certainly do not, I will reserve the right to insist that they all talk in terms that people like me can understand, since there is more of me out there than you, although not in this room today. (laughter) What we are going to do is introduce each panelist, and each one will make a short three- to five-minute presentation. Then my instructions say that we are going to have a McLaughlin Group discussion, which I guess means lots of yelling and screaming and talking at once. (laughter) After that's over, about 4:10, we'll open up the panel for questions from the audience. To my left is Peter Denning, who is Chairman of the Computer Science Department at George Mason University and also the associate dean for computing. He is the program chair of this conference, has also served as the president of ACM, and he is currently the editor of Communications. Simon Davies, to my right, also wears blue suits, but you can tell him from Mitch, because he wears a white hat.

      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",

She publishes two newsletters, Release 1.0 and Rel-EAST. She has also been one of the driving forces promoting East-West relations through computer networks.

Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their governments to regulate commerce, erase inequities, and build societies of better human beings. For over a hundred years, many people, from peasants to intellectuals, had faith that strong governments would bring them a better life. This faith was part of the clearing in which Communist governments flourished; although the United States took an anti-Communist stand, the same faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by great national programs including Social Security, welfare, food stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society. This faith is now shattered. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life. The dramatic collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people for federal, state, and local governments. The poor track record of government is not the only reason for the shift. Information technology has accelerated the process. Communications that took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions. Radio, TV, fax, and now E-mail are common worldwide, so much so that not even a powerful government can control what information its citizens have.",
      "It's a debate and should be a debate about who does what best. It should be revised from time to time, but the important question is, If we get a significant distribution system like cable television, how should we classify it? I speak here from the heart, because 20 years ago, I was trying to fasten onto, or gain the recognition for, cable as a broadband distribution system which was only trivially in the program production and publishing business, but was very much in the distribution business and ought to have been treated as a common carrier open to all information suppliers. Had that happened, we would have been very much further along in the vision that some of us had 20 years ago. (applause) It tends to support what I said about not going in for premature freezing or characterization of how things look. It was decided, because the broadcasters felt threatened, to treat cable as a species of broadcasting. That's the greatest frittering away of resources in my lifetime, and perhaps in the lifetime of the United States of America. Let's not make that mistake again. Let's be clear-eyed and ask the broad-scale questions about public use and benefit. Thank you. LIASSON: Let's open it up to the audience. If you have any questions ... oh my God, wrestle your way to the microphone!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Let us not forget the history of the commons in which a wealthy society creates in its overflowing abundance structures on which all people can participate. This was originally, back in medieval society, the structure that was created for the support of the poor. In the abundance of the land in which the overpopulation was not a question, and there was much agriculture to go around, and the poor were supported out of the commonly-owned things that were jointly owned by all society. That's all I have to say. LIASSON: Who wants to start?\nDAVIES: Sticking to my apocalyptic vision just for the moment, because that's how I'm characterized, what I would like to see, just as my own social experiment, if you like, is for the various groups that this room represents and groups that you are all involved in, is to actually set up the apocalyptic vision, and then see how you as part of the information technology community can utilize it, stop it, or reverse it.",
      "And I think that -- I'm not espousing utopian vision -- there needs to be an utopian vision out there, so people have something to give them some inspiration. But values are a lot more important than technology. There are some values in this community -- and I'm not sure if it's an elite or a minority or both -- but it's really in the propagation of a sense of values about openness and tolerance, acting on that basis and living one's life, and saving capitalism from itself and things like that where we can make a difference. If some of the expressions are technological, that's fine. We are living in an era where people like buttons, and so on. If we do that well, the presidential candidates are going to be coming to us. LIASSON: You talk about Cyberspace not being ready for prime time -- I still want a definition of Cyberspace in 25 words or less -- but I think you want to transform prime time to a certain extent. DYSON: Mostly I agree with this, but the press does have two roles: one is collecting information and uncovering things, and the other is setting the agenda. If 12,000 voices are crying out, who's going to listen to them? Who's going to notice when they do discover that the President did something wrong? Again, it's a check and balance sort of thing, but there is a certain community that is created by collective media.\nKAPOR: Esther, what makes you believe that in Cyberspace Mara won't have two hours a day of her own that everyone listens to. (laughter) She might get more time than she gets today, because people trust her. DYSON: But then she becomes prime time. LIASSON: But you said before that instead of one global village, we have a lot of little global villages. I'm wondering if instead, we won't have millions of little huts. I mean individual huts. There are just so many different choices. LIASSON: What I'm wondering is, if everybody becomes their own producer, publisher, what does that mean for the future? KAPOR: I think we'll get a much more fluid, self-organizing state. I don't think in practice everybody is going to be what we think of today as a broadcast publisher."

      "No. God doesn’t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. God doesn’t will for us to do evil or to harm other people. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death. This post was adapted from my sermon preached at Butner Federal Prison on September 14, 2014. We were gathered at the plaza, right between the giant bull statue and the unattractive fences of a construction site. Luminary bags weighted with rice and lit candles marked the sacred space surrounding 30 of us, one to represent each person who died as a result of domestic violence the previous year in our state. The vigil began as planned, simple, but meaningful, to remember victims of this tragedy and raise awareness about the suffering that takes place behind closed doors. About halfway through the simple service, a woman stumbled into the vigil, interrupting the solemn mood without realizing that a group was gathered and someone was speaking. She stood silent for a few moments, listening to the speaker. When she realized that the speaker was talking about domestic violence, she began to interrupt, asking questions to the speaker, sharing details from her own experience with abuse. “What would you do…what would you do if…?” she cried. Then, as unexpectedly as she joined us and as abruptly as her interruption, she began to weep, uncontrollably crying for the rest of the vigil. A couple of women gathered around her and held her as she wept. Before long, it was my turn to pray. I barely got the words out…I could hardly project my shaking voice over her loud sobs. “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,” Jesus proclaims in the second line of the beatitudes. Blessed are those who mourn. How is this weeping woman, this victim of abuse, blessed? She mourns the injustices she’s experienced, her suffering, the ways her life has been shaped by pain and her inability to free herself from her oppression.",
      "All men are my brothers. I would have liked to have said it then, and I would like to say it now: all men are my brothers. But all men are not my brothers. Why? Because all women are my sisters. And the brother who denies the rights of his sister: that brother is not my brother. At the very best, he is my half-brother - by definition. Osama is not my brother. Religion is sensitive ground, as well it might be. Here we walk on eggshells. Because religion is itself an eggshell. Today, in the West, there are no good excuses for religious belief - unless we think that ignorance, reaction and sentimentality are good excuses. This is of course not so in the East, where, we acknowledge, almost every living citizen in many huge and populous countries is intimately defined by religious belief. The excuses, here, are very persuasive; and we duly accept that 'faith' - recently and almost endearingly defined as 'the desire for the approval of supernatural beings' - is a world-historical force and a world-historical actor. All religions, unsurprisingly, have their terrorists, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, even Buddhist. But we are not hearing from those religions. We are hearing from Islam. Let us make the position clear. We can begin by saying, not only that we respect Muhammad, but that no serious person could fail to respect Muhammad - a unique and luminous historical being. Judged by the continuities he was able to set in motion, he remains a titanic figure, and, for Muslims, all-answering: a revolutionary, a warrior, and a sovereign, a Christ and a Caesar, 'with a Koran in one hand', as Bagehot imagined him, 'and a sword in the other'. Muhammad has strong claims to being the most extraordinary man who ever lived. And always a man, as he always maintained, and not a god. Naturally we respect Muhammad. But we do not respect Muhammad Atta. Until recently it was being said that what we are confronted with, here, is 'a civil war' within Islam. That's what all this was supposed to be: not a clash of civilisations or anything like that, but a civil war within Islam."

      "In particular Mn incorporation is highly inhomogeneous. For very low growth temperatures (below 120$^\\circ$C) the diffusion of Mn atoms leads to the formation of Mn rich, vertical nanocolumns. Their density mostly depends on Mn concentration and their mean diameter is about 2 nm. These results can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Fukushima \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Fuku06}: they proposed a model of spinodal decomposition in (Ga,Mn)N and (Zn,Cr)Te based on layer by layer growth conditions and a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms which leads to the formation of nanocolumns. This model may also properly describe the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns in our samples. Layer by layer growth conditions can be deduced from RHEED pattern evolution during growth. For all the samples grown at low temperature, RHEED observations clearly indicate two-dimensional growth. Moreover, Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructures have been grown and observed by TEM (see Fig. 5). Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge (as well as Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$) interfaces are very flat and sharp thus confirming a two-dimensional, layer by layer growth mode. Therefore we can assume that the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns is a consequence of 2D-spinodal decomposition. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\center\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig5.eps}\n    \\caption{Cross section high resolution micrograph of a Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructure. This sample has been grown at 130 $^{\\circ}$C with 6\\% Mn. Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ layers are 15 nm thick and Ge spacers 5 nm thick. We clearly see the sharpness of both Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge and Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ interfaces. Mn segregation leading to the columns formation already takes place in very thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.}\n\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure} For growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C, cross section TEM and EFTEM observations (not shown here) reveal the coexistence of two Mn-rich phases: nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters embedded in the germanium matrix.",
      "In summary, in a wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations, we have evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal decomposition leading to the formation of Mn-rich nanocolumns in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. This decomposition is probably the consequence of: $(i)$ a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms, $(ii)$ a strong surface diffusion of Mn atoms in germanium even at low growth temperatures and $(iii)$ layer by layer growth conditions. We have also investigated the influence of growth parameters on the spinodal decomposition: at low growth temperatures (100$^{\\circ}$C), increasing the Mn content leads to higher columns densities while at higher growth temperatures (150$^{\\circ}$C), the columns density remains nearly constant whereas their size increases drastically. By plotting the nanocolumns density as a function of Mn content, we have shown that the mechanism of Mn incorporation in Ge changes above 5 \\% of Mn. Finally, using TEM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C.\n\n\\section{Magnetic properties \\label{magnetic}}\n\nWe have thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films for different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. In this section, we focus on Mn concentrations between 2 \\% and 11 \\%. We could clearly identify four different magnetic phases in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films : diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix, low $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\leq$ 170 K), high $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\geq$ 400 K) and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters ($T_{C}$ $\\thickapprox$ 300 K). The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature ($<$ 120$^{\\circ}$C), we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing T$_{g}$ above 120$^{\\circ}$C, we first obtain continuous columns exhibiting low $T_{C}$ ($<$ 170 K) and high $T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) for $T_{g}\\approx$130$^{\\circ}$C. The larger columns become ferromagnetic \\textit{i.e.}",
      "Increasing Mn concentration leads to higher columns densities while diameters remain nearly unchanged. For higher growth temperatures, the nanocolumns mean diameter increases and their size distribution widens. Moreover the 4 independent magnetic nanostructures percolate into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Some columns are ferromagnetic even if Curie temperatures remain quite low. In this regime, increasing Mn concentration leads to larger columns while their density remains nearly the same. In parallel, Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters start to form in the film with their $c$-axis perpendicular to the film plane. In both temperature regimes, the Mn incorporation mechanism in the nanocolumns and/or in the matrix changes above 5 \\% of Mn and nanocolumns exhibit an isotropic magnetic behaviour due to the competing effects of out-of-plane shape anisotropy and in-plane magnetoelastic coupling. Finally for a narrow range of growth temperatures around 130$^{\\circ}$C, nanocolumns exhibit Curie temperatures higher than 400 K. Our goal is now to investigate the crystalline structure inside the nanocolumns, in particular the position of Mn atoms in the distorted diamond structure, which is essential to understand magnetic and future transport properties in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.\n\n\\section{Aknowledgements}\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. F. Rieutord for grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements performed on the GMT station of BM32 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.",
      "In the ZFC-FC procedure, the sample is first cooled down to 5 K in zero magnetic field and the susceptibility is subsequently recorded at 0.015 Tesla while increasing the temperature up to 400 K (ZFC curve). Then, the susceptibility is recorded under the same magnetic field while decreasing the temperature down to 5 K (FC curve). Three different regimes can be clearly distinguished. \\\\\nFor $T_{g}\\leq$120$^{\\circ}$C, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization remains nearly the same while increasing growth temperature. The overall magnetic signal vanishing above 200 K is attributed to the nanocolumns whereas the increasing signal below 50 K originates from diluted Mn atoms in the surrounding matrix. The Mn concentration dependence of the saturation magnetization is displayed in figure 8. For the lowest Mn concentration (4 \\%), the contribution from diluted Mn atoms is very high and drops sharply for higher Mn concentrations (7 \\%, 9 \\% and 11.3 \\%). Therefore the fraction of Mn atoms in the diluted matrix decreases with Mn concentration probably because Mn atoms are more and more incorporated in the nanocolumns. In parallel, the Curie temperature of nanocolumns increases with the Mn concentration reaching 170 K for 11.3 \\% of Mn. This behavior may be related to different Mn compositions and to the increasing diameter of nanocolumns (from 1.8 nm to 2.8 nm) as discussed in section \\ref{structural}. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig8.eps}\n    \\caption{Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 100$^{\\circ}$C plotted for different Mn concentrations: 4.1 \\%; 7 \\%; 8.9 \\% and 11.3 \\%.}\n\\label{fig8}\n\\end{figure}\n\nZFC-FC measurements show that the nanocolumns are superparamagnetic. The magnetic signal from the diluted Mn atoms in the matrix is too weak to be detected in susceptibility measurements at low temperature. In samples containing 4 \\% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves superimpose down to low temperatures.",
      "Moreover, their average diameter increases significantly and size distributions become very broad (see Fig. 3a). For the highest Mn concentration (11.3 \\%) we observe the coexistence of very small columns with a diameter of 2.5 nm and very large columns with a diameter of 9 nm. In samples grown at 150$^\\circ$C containing 11.3 \\% of Mn, the crystalline structure of nanocolumns is also highly modified. In plane view TEM micrographs, one can see columns exhibiting several different crystalline structures. We still observe some columns which are fully coherent with the Ge matrix like in the samples grown at lower temperature. Nevertheless, observations performed on these samples grown at 150$^\\circ$C and with 11.3\\% Mn reveal some uniaxially \\cite{Jame06} or fully relaxed columns exhibiting a misfit of 4 \\% between the matrix and the columns and leading to misfit dislocations at the interface between the column and the matrix (see fig. 4b). Thus we can conclude that coherent columns are probably in strong compression and the surrounding matrix in tension. On the same samples (T$_g$=150$^{\\circ}$C, 11.3\\% Mn), we also observe a large number of highly disordered nanocolumns leading to an amorphous like TEM contrast(fig. 4c). \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.31\\linewidth]{./fig4a.eps}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.31\\linewidth]{./fig4b.eps}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.31\\linewidth]{./fig4c.eps}\n    \\caption{Plane view high resolution transmission electron micrographs of different types of nanocolumns : (a) typical structure of a column grown at 100$^{\\circ}$C.

(c) Amorphous nanocolumn. These columns are typical in samples grown at 150$^{\\circ}$C with high Mn contents.}\n \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure} In conclusion, we have evidenced a complex mechanism of Mn incorporation in Mn doped Ge films grown at low temperature."

      "\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec4}\n\nThis paper introduced the Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration technique for steady-state, monoenergetic transport in homogeneous slab geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first nonlinear HOLO method that accelerates \\textit{all $L$ moments} of the angular flux. Upon convergence, the LO and HO models are consistent; in other words, the (lower-order) modified Fokker-Planck equation \\textit{preserves the same angular moments} of the flux obtained with the (higher-order) transport equation. NFPA was tested on a homogeneous medium with an isotropic internal source with vacuum boundaries, and in a homogeneous medium with no internal source and an incoming beam boundary. For both problems, three different scattering kernels were used. The runtime and iterations of NFPA and FPSA were shown to be similar. They both vastly outperformed DSA and GMRES for all cases by orders of magnitude. However, NFPA has the feature of preserving the angular moments of the flux in both the HO and LO equations, which offers the advantage of integrating the LO model into multiphysics models. In the future, we intend to test NFPA capabilities for a variety of multiphysics problems and analyze its performance. To apply NFPA to more realistic problems, it needs to be extended to include time and energy dependence. Additionally, the method needs to be adapted to address geometries with higher-order spatial dimensions. Finally, for the NFPA method to become mathematically ``complete\", a full convergence examination using Fourier analysis must be performed. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper and must be left for future work. \\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nThe authors acknowledge support under award number NRC-HQ-84-15-G-0024 from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

      "Soon you’ll be lobbing missiles hundreds of miles. How do I capture a zone? If you play for the Legion and are launching nanobots into a zone controlled by the Swarm, you will capture the zone for the Legion as soon as you have destroyed enough of the enemy that your nonbots outnumber theirs. If you are the person who causes the zone to change control to the Legion, you will be listed as the Capturer of the Zone. The Person with the most nanobots in the zone is the zone leader. What is my current zone? How do you know? Your current zone is determined by your proximity to the nearest zone center. So, while you might be inside the governmental boundaries of a city, your scope (phone) could tell you your current zone is a different city, if that city’s center is closer. So I just keep deploying? Yes, in the early levels of the game, just keep deploying and harvesting your bases. You will earn XP (experience points) proving your loyalty to your Faction. You will level up quickly and soon have access to many more options. So all I can do is just attack? You only get assault bots to start. They are the most basic type of nanobot formation. As you level up you will get many more options, including bots that are good at defense, energy attacks, long-range deployments, formations that will buff the shields for all your faction-mates in the zone, and many more. My faction already controls this zone should I still attack? Yes, assault bots won’t attack your friends. You will increase the bot counts for that zone, which will deter opponents. Attack bots can defend your zone; they just aren’t very good at it. As you level up you will unlock defensive formations that are better for deploying if your faction already holds the zone. I’ll never knock out my enemy at this rate! In the first few levels your impact might feel minimal, but every deployment helps you gain experience. It won’t take long to level up if you keep at it. If you are unlucky enough to be in a zone where someone has already built up huge defenses, you may be in for a long fight.",
      "But remember, your scope moves with you. Go explore the world and find softer targets. Once you level up, it won’t seem like a toy gun against a battleship. You’ll get your big weapons once you prove yourself. We have already seen operatives brag about taking down 1,000,000 nanobots in just a couple days. Nothing is impossible. How do I attack a different zone? As you level up you will unlock more and stronger formations. Those new formations will have range. While at the early levels you can only attack nearby zones, as you level up your attacks will go 10-20 miles (roughly 15-30 Km) and you will eventually gain access to nanomissiles that can go hundreds of miles. What should I buy in the depot first? The smallest thing to buy is a refresh. We give you some of these as you level up so you can try them out. Refreshes will refill (or partially fill depending on the size of your tank) your bot bar or your energy bar. But after that, it depends on your goals. There is much to choose from. Do you want to be able to deploy more nanobots on every launch? Do you want to boost your offensive or defensive bots? Do you want to be able to launch missiles into towns far away? All of these things are possible. Look through the depot and see what you like. Most of the time you will need to buy an upgrade before you can buy the ordinance. For example, missiles are fairly inexpensive, but you need to buy the MX Rack Missile Launcher before you can launch them. Buy the upgrade first. What is the difference between qredits and cubes in the depot? A qredit (aka: credit, which looks like the child of a Q and € ) is the type of currency you earn in the game by harvesting your bases. Cubes (aka: power cubes) are purchased with real money in the Bank section of the Depot. We want everyone to be able to do everything in the game for free, by earning qredits, but for those who want to move a bit faster, you can purchase cubes to speed things along. Purchasing cubes is how QONQR makes money. We very much appreciate your support.",
      "Defection will usually result in a demotion in rank. This is accomplished through awards with negative rank points. Those awards are: Spy - First switch to an opposing faction (-20 points) Double Agent - Return to a faction from which you had previously defected (-20 points) Mercenary - Become a member of all three factions (-20 points) Other Faction Change Details: You may not switch factions again until at least 60 days have passed since your last faction switch. Defection point penalties are applied only once per award Players that earn all three spy awards, may once again switch factions at any time as they could during the training levels 1 through 99. The decision to switch factions is one that must be made with strong determination. Nanobots cannot be reanimated once destroyed. You will retain your earned experience, level, formations, qredits, cubes, and upgrades. However, as far as your zones go, you will be starting over. ...has got to be one of the funniest moments I've seen in qonqr yet lol. The **** change operation was a success! As a relatively new player for faceless in a region dominated by swarm i can understand the OP. However, judging from the numbers i see here on a regular basis i think you are asking a bit much. My idea would be the opposite approach. Why not add a weapon with extremely short range, let's say like 5km that acts like a bomb and make it much stronk? That would add some serious home advantage. Or alternativley make attack formations lose power over range (exclude nanos and plasma). Maybe something like that would allow newcomers to at least get a foothold in their homezones. It's just an idea, maybe i overlooked something? This is by design. Some day it is possible (I said someday) we could offer skins for your scope. So we will need a uniform color scheme. You can tell the formation families based on the shape of the box. Trapezoid is attack, diamond is defense, and octagon is support. It will take some time to get comfortable with the change. Geophysical based game.",
      "I've been accused of doing favors, changing the rules, and various other backhanded deals. It appears it comes down reading the rules. You do not have to play for every faction for 60 days in order to earn free switching status. Here is a common scenario many players have used to achieve free switching status and avoiding playing for one faction they despise. 1. Start with Swarm 2. Switch to Legion (earn Spy) play for 60 days 3. Switch back to Swarm (earn Double Agent) play for 60 days 4. Switch to Faceless (earn Mercenary) immediately switch back to Swarm or Legion Below is the complete text on the switch nanobots screen. It is the same text that has been there from Day 1 with the exception of the level 100 rules that went into place earlier this year, where you could switch as much as you want before level 100 , but those switches don't count towards the medals. This text has been part of this description since Jan 15, 2013. \"Players that earn all three spy awards, may once again switch factions at any time as they could during the training levels 1 through 99.\" Prior to Jan 15, the text said this. \"Players that earn all three awards may be given the opportunity to switch factions more quickly in future updates (contact support for more information)\" I pulled that right out of source control, which includes the entire change history. Here is the complete text from this page. http://portal.qonqr....r/SwitchFaction WARNING: Defection has consequences! Self-destruct will be initiated on all your nanobots. Without the self-destruct, you would be required to battle against your former self to regain control of your zones. You will lose the capture and leadership of any zones you currently hold. Lifetime captures will be unaffected. If you are still completing the training levels and have not reached Level 100, you may switch as often as you like to find the faction that suits you best. Once you have reached Level 100 switching factions has rewards, but also has additional consequences beyond the self-destruct of all your nanobots.",
      "Anyways, probably not a bad idea but, considering the issues with the three platforms and the development of blue for those platforms, I doubt the resources are available for development on a new platform. Seen the blog? Its Qonqr meets wheel of fortune! I am happy to announce that today I both completed the training and captured my first zone. ^THIS so now that qonqr has been thoroughly funded, can we have blue now? Or is that not happening still lol. Atleast I am not legion and there for we can have this intelligent discussion rather than just compete over who has the best words XD ohhhhh someone bring the bill to legion cuz someone just served them extra double order of stir fried SNAPPPPPP If the devs wont make zone dueling for us I hope out there somewhere are those who would empty a zone and challenge one on one to a local battle. I'd like to see the transcript of deployments made / moves made as well that would be neat I think such events would be cool. I suppose if people give up on atlantis as it works now they can schedule their own tournements in empty atlantis zones.. have a team clear the zone.. put 1 vs 1 or teams vs teams.. like fisticuffs challenges.. find out what these warriors are really made of! @Qonqrd everyone you know must face palm every time you make a post. Its embarrassing. Mega cubers or whatever you want to call them are not great for the opposing team surrounding them but are great for the game itself (money) and for the team they are part of. Multiscopers are not not great for the opposing team surrounding them and bring nothing to the game but are great for the team they are part of. Both have a negative impact on enemy teams/players but only one benefits the game itself. Both can make people want to quit out of frustration. And that's not great for the game. @OP unlimited refresh is over powered. Its frustrating to fight against a ridiculous amount of refreshes. Unfortunately i dont see anything changing unless this game gets a lot more people playing. More people might mean more money for the company from various sources."

The committee also continued its dialogue with the Committee on Corporation Associates about a collaborative workshop. This activity, tentatively slated for the New Orleans meeting, will seek additional insights from chemical and allied products companies about public policy barriers that limit adoption of more sustainable products and practices as well as policy incentives that would lead to increased sustainability in the chemical enterprise. At its Chicago meeting, the committee welcomed the president of the Jordanian Chemical Society and the past-president of the Arab Union of Chemists. The committee was briefed on Pittcon 2007, where, with financial support from the Society of Analytical Chemists of Pittsburgh, ACS coordinated participation of a scientific delegation from Adriatic nations. The committee heard reports on the 2007 Frontiers of Chemical Science III: Research & Education in the Middle East meeting; the 2007 Transatlantic Frontiers of Chemistry meeting, which was jointly sponsored by ACS, the German Chemical Society, and the Royal Society of Chemistry; planned workshops to engage U.S. and Chinese early-career scientists in chemical biology, supramolecular, and new materials chemistry; and ACS Discovery Corps U.S./Brazil Research Collaboration Project in Biomass Conversion to Biofuels, Biomaterials & Chemicals.

Or wouldn't you bother at all?\nDYSON: Does he want to get elected, or does he want to make a point? LIASSON: I think he wants to make a point. If he wants to get elected, I think the discussion would stop right now. DYSON: Let me just try a serious answer. I think what a candidate could say is, \"I'm no longer going to protect the textile industry, the peanut butter interests, the sugar guys, the antediluvian steel mills. If I'm going to have an industrial policy and help anyone, it's going to be new technology. I'm going to focus on investment in R&D. I am going to create a national infrastructure for telecommunications, just the way we created a highway system years ago. I'm going to put people to work doing these things.\" I think that would go over reasonably well. I think it's something most of us would agree on. (laughter) We have an industrial policy -- we might as well acknowledge it, and we might as well have it be forward-looking.\nKAPOR: Now there is something about the question as to whether this is presidential material that I think is ironic, given that most people really want to vote for \"none of the above.\" We know in our hearts that we have come to a particular period in history in which the presidential spectacle seems to be particularly irrelevant to whatever set of problems we have on our minds. As a great believer in democracy, I think this is incredibly lamentable. We need to do something about this, because there are a lot of issues, but Cyberspace is not ready for prime time. It would be trivialized -- I have seen what Geraldo did to hackers, and I don't need to see any more. It seems to me that the presidential candidates are really not the leaders that they ought to be, but are always putting their finger to the wind to see if they can detect some current of values or beliefs that can help get them elected.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "And I think that -- I'm not espousing utopian vision -- there needs to be an utopian vision out there, so people have something to give them some inspiration. But values are a lot more important than technology. There are some values in this community -- and I'm not sure if it's an elite or a minority or both -- but it's really in the propagation of a sense of values about openness and tolerance, acting on that basis and living one's life, and saving capitalism from itself and things like that where we can make a difference. If some of the expressions are technological, that's fine. We are living in an era where people like buttons, and so on. If we do that well, the presidential candidates are going to be coming to us. LIASSON: You talk about Cyberspace not being ready for prime time -- I still want a definition of Cyberspace in 25 words or less -- but I think you want to transform prime time to a certain extent. DYSON: Mostly I agree with this, but the press does have two roles: one is collecting information and uncovering things, and the other is setting the agenda. If 12,000 voices are crying out, who's going to listen to them? Who's going to notice when they do discover that the President did something wrong? Again, it's a check and balance sort of thing, but there is a certain community that is created by collective media.\nKAPOR: Esther, what makes you believe that in Cyberspace Mara won't have two hours a day of her own that everyone listens to. (laughter) She might get more time than she gets today, because people trust her. DYSON: But then she becomes prime time. LIASSON: But you said before that instead of one global village, we have a lot of little global villages. I'm wondering if instead, we won't have millions of little huts. I mean individual huts. There are just so many different choices. LIASSON: What I'm wondering is, if everybody becomes their own producer, publisher, what does that mean for the future? KAPOR: I think we'll get a much more fluid, self-organizing state. I don't think in practice everybody is going to be what we think of today as a broadcast publisher."

      "At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third. He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK). English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.",
      "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash. In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later."

      "However, it turns out that the right choice of the subseries length is crucial for this approach, but there is no data-based method available for this. In this work, an alternative way to estimate a Toeplitz covariance matrix and its inverse is chosen. Our approach exploits the one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities. First, the given data are transformed into approximate Gaussian random variables whose mean equals to the logarithm of the spectral density. Then, the log-spectral density is estimated by a periodic smoothing spline with a data-driven smoothing parameter. Finally, the resulting spectral density estimator is transformed into an estimator for Σ or its inverse. It is shown that this procedure leads to an estimator that is fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the spectral norm over a large class of Toeplitz covariance matrices. In particular, this class includes Toeplitz covariance matrices that correspond to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities. Moreover, the computation is very efficient, does not require iterative or resampling schemes and allows to apply any inference and adaptive estimation procedures developed in the context of nonparametric Gaussian regression. Estimation of the spectral density from a stationary time series is a research topic with a long history. Earlier nonparametric methods are based on smoothing of the (log-)periodogram, which itself is not a consistent estimator . Another line of nonparametric methods for estimating the spectral density is based on the Whittle likelihood, which is an ap-proximation to the exact likelihood of the time series in the frequency domain. For example, estimated the spectral density from a penalized Whittle likelihood, while used polynomial splines to estimate the log-spectral density function maximizing the Whittle likelihood. Recently, Bayesian methods for spectral density estimation have been proposed (see , but these may become very computationally intensive in large samples due to posterior sampling.",
      "The minimax optimal convergence rate for nonparametric estimators of Hölder continuous spectral densities from Gaussian stationary time series was obtained by under the L p , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, norm. Only few works on spectral density estimation show the optimality of the corresponding estimators. In particular, and derived convergence rates of their estimators for the log-spectral density under the L 2 norm, while neglecting the Whittle likelihood approximation error. In general, most works on spectral density estimation do not exploit further the close connection to the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation. In particular, an upper bound for the L ∞ risk of a spectral density estimator automatically provides an upper bound for the risk of the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator under the spectral norm. This fact is used to establish the minimax optimality of our nonparametric estimator for the Toeplitz covariance matrices. The main contribution of this work is to show that our proposed spectral density estimator is not only numerically very efficient, but also achieves the minimax optimal rate in the L ∞ norm, which in turn ensures the minimax optimality of the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the model is introduced and ap-proximate diagonalization of Toeplitz covariance matrices with the discrete cosine transform is discussed. Moreover, an alternative version of the Whittle's likelihood is proposed. In Section 3, new estimators for the Toeplitz covariance matrix and the precision matrix are derived, while in Section 4 their theoretical properties are presented. Section 5 contains simulation results, Section 6 presents a real data example, and Section 7 closes the paper with a discussion. The proofs are given in the appendix to the paper. Set up and diagonalization of Toeplitz matrices\n\nLet Y 1 , . . . , Y n i.i.d. ∼ N p (0 p , Σ), where Σ is a (p × p)-dimensional positive definite covariance matrix with a Toeplitz structure, that is, Σ = {σ |i−j| } p i,j=1 0.",
      "The sample size n may tend to infinity or to be a constant. The case n = 1 corresponds to a single observation of a stationary time series, and in this case the data are simply denoted by Y ∼N p (0 p , Σ). The dimension p is assumed to grow. The spectral density function f , corresponding to a Toeplitz covariance matrix Σ, is given by so that for f ∈ L 2 (−π, π) the inverse Fourier transform implies Hence, Σ is completely characterized by f , and the non-negativity of the spectral density function implies the positive definiteness of the covariance matrix. Moreover, the decay of the autocovariance σ k is directly connected to the smoothness of f . Finally, the convergence rate of a Toeplitz covariance estimator and that of the corresponding spectral density estimator are directly related via Σ ≤ f ∞ := sup x∈ |f (x)|, where • denotes the spectral norm (see . As in , we introduce a class of positive definite Toeplitz covariance matrices with Hölder continuous spectral densities. For β = γ + α > 0, where The optimal convergence rate for estimating Toeplitz covariance matrices over P β (M 0 , M 1 ) depends crucially on β. It is well known that the k-th Fourier coefficient of a function whose γ-th derivative is α-Hölder continuous decays at least with order O(k −β ) (see . Hence, β determines the decay rate of the autocovariances σ k , which are the Fourier coefficients of the spectral density f , as k → ∞. In particular, this implies that for β ∈ (0, 1], the class P β (M 0 , M 1 ) includes Toeplitz covariance matrices corresponding to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities, since the sequence of corresponding autocovariances is not summable. A connection between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities is further exploited in the following lemma. Lemma 1. Let Σ ∈ P β (M 0 , M 1 ) and let x j = (j − 1)/(p − 1), j = 1, ..., p, then where δ i,j is the Kroneker delta, O(•) terms are uniform over i, j = 1, . . . , p and divided by √ 2 when i, j ∈ {1, p} is the Discrete Cosine Transform I (DCT-I) matrix.",
      "The proof can be found in Appendix A.1. This result shows that the DCT-I matrix approximately diagonalizes Toeplitz covariance matrices and that the diagonalization error depends to some extent on the smoothness of the corresponding spectral density. In the spectral density literature the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix\n, where i is the imaginary unit, is typically employed to approximately diagonalize Toeplitz covariance matrices. Using the fact that introduced an approximation for the likelihood of a single Gaussian stationary time series (case n = 1), the so-called Whittle likelihood (1) The quantity , where F j denotes the j-th column of F , is known as the periodogram at the j-th Fourier frequency. Note that due to periodogram symmetry, only p/2 data points I 1 , ..., I p/2 are available for estimating the mean f (2πj/p), j = 1, . . . , p/2 , where x denotes the largest integer strictly smaller than x. The Whittle likelihood has become a popular tool for parameter estimation of stationary time series, e.g., for nonparametric and parametric spectral density estimation or for estimation of the Hurst exponent, see e.g., ; . Lemma 1 yields the following alternative version of the Whittle likelihood where W j = (D t j Y ) 2 . Note that this likelihood approximation is based on twice as many data points W j as the standard Whittle likelihood. Thus, it allows for a more efficient use of the data Y to estimate the parameter of interest, such as the spectral density or the Hurst parameter. Equations ( ) or (2) invite for the estimation of f by maximizing the (penalized) likelihood over certain linear spaces (e.g., spline spaces), as suggested e.g., in or . However, such an approach requires well-designed numerical methods to solve the corresponding optimization problem, since the spectral density in the second term of (1) or ( ) is in the denominator, which does not allow to obtain a closed-form expression for the estimator and often leads to numerical instabilities. Also, the choice of the smoothing parameter becomes challenging."

      "Institutions: University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam. Dendritic spines are protrusions emerging from the dendrite of a neuron and represent the primary postsynaptic targets of excitatory inputs in the brain. Technological advances have identified these structures as key elements in neuron connectivity and synaptic plasticity. The quantitative analysis of spine morphology using light microscopy remains an essential problem due to technical limitations associated with light's intrinsic refraction limit. Dendritic spines can be readily identified by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy. However, measuring subtle changes in the shape and size of spines is difficult because spine dimensions other than length are usually smaller than conventional optical resolution fixed by light microscopy's theoretical resolution limit of 200 nm. Several recently developed super resolution techniques have been used to image cellular structures smaller than the 200 nm, including dendritic spines. These techniques are based on classical far-field operations and therefore allow the use of existing sample preparation methods and to image beyond the surface of a specimen. Described here is a working protocol to apply super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to the imaging of dendritic spines in primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Possible applications of SIM overlap with those of confocal microscopy. However, the two techniques present different applicability. SIM offers higher effective lateral resolution, while confocal microscopy, due to the usage of a physical pinhole, achieves resolution improvement at the expense of removal of out of focus light. In this protocol, primary neurons are cultured on glass coverslips using a standard protocol, transfected with DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins and imaged using SIM. The whole protocol described herein takes approximately 2 weeks, because dendritic spines are imaged after 16-17 days in vitro, when dendritic development is optimal.",

Institutions: VECT-HORUS SAS, CNRS, NICN UMR 7259.The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. Our aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. Astrocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection following trypsin digestion and were frozen for later co-culture. RBEC were isolated from 5-week-old rat cortices. The brains were cleaned of meninges and white matter, and mechanically dissociated following enzymatic digestion. Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders. The transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of brain endothelial monolayers, indicating the tightness of TJs reached 300 ohm·cm2 on average.",

Institutions: University of California, Santa Cruz. In the mammalian cortex, neurons form extremely complicated networks and exchange information at synapses. Changes in synaptic strength, as well as addition/removal of synapses, occur in an experience-dependent manner, providing the structural foundation of neuronal plasticity. As postsynaptic components of the most excitatory synapses in the cortex, dendritic spines are considered to be a good proxy of synapses. Taking advantages of mouse genetics and fluorescent labeling techniques, individual neurons and their synaptic structures can be labeled in the intact brain. Here we introduce a transcranial imaging protocol using two-photon laser scanning microscopy to follow fluorescently labeled postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in vivo. This protocol utilizes a thinned-skull preparation, which keeps the skull intact and avoids inflammatory effects caused by exposure of the meninges and the cortex. Therefore, images can be acquired immediately after surgery is performed.",

Octavio Garcia, Maria Torres, Pablo Helguera, Pinar Coskun, Jorge Busciglio. PUBLISHED: 07-02-2010\tDowns syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However, the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance, astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons. We have previously shown impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes leading to metabolic alterations in protein processing and secretion. In this study, we investigated whether deficits in astrocyte function contribute to DS spine pathology. Analysis of Dendritic Spine Morphology in Cultured CNS Neurons Authors: Deepak P. Srivastava, Kevin M. Woolfrey, Peter Penzes. Published: 07-13-2011 JoVE Neuroscience\nDendritic spines are the sites of the majority of excitatory connections within the brain, and form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses. These structures are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. In response to classical Hebbian plasticity as well as neuromodulatory signals, dendritic spines can change shape and number, which is thought to be critical for the refinement of neural circuits and the processing and storage of information within the brain. Within dendritic spines, a complex network of proteins link extracellular signals with the actin cyctoskeleton allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that a number of disease states, ranging from schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders, display abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers. Moreover, recent genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to suggestions that these proteins may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity that, in part, underlie the pathophysiology of these disorders."

      "I’m sitting here in disbelief of the attack I just watched Mary Goloff and Jim Walker wage on Mark Sorensen at city council tonight. I couldn’t make the meeting, so I have been watching it via computer. Sorensen had been challenged by a smarmy Jim Walker to list what changes he would make to balance the budget. Sorensen carefully began to explain that city funds had been depleted by millions over the last few years, with escalating costs leaving revenues in the dirt. He also explained that the lion’s share of our expenses are “operating costs,” meaning, salaries. He also carefully explained that there were programs we simply could not afford anymore, meaning, salaries. Mary Goloff could be heard heckling him off microphone. If you or I did what she was doing we’d be asked to leave the room, possibly with police escort. But Mayor Schwab just sat there looking at Goloff, saying nothing. Goloff finally got on mike, interrupted Sorensen, and asked him to be specific. So, Sorensen offered housing, saying it had been a mistake to undertake so many housing projects, and he also specified the arts programs – such as the requirement that any capital project include one percent of the total cost of that project be added for art. At this point Goloff began to interrupt Sorensen. She started heckling him about how “we all agree” that the arts are important, yadda, yadda. She just kept at Sorensen, not allowing him to answer any of her out-there questions, until Sorensen asked her to stop interrupting him. After a quick exchange Walker butted in to attack Sorensen. Out of nowhere, Walker bashed Sorensen about wanting to spend more money on the police department, asking Sorensen where he would get the money to hire more police. This question was off base, Sorensen hadn’t even gotten that far before Goloff had completely derailed him. Jim Walker is just sitting out his time, he seems to be enjoying himself at all of our expense. He, like so many “public servants,” seems to think he is elected to do what he wants, what seems like “the right thing” in his fairy tale mind, instead of carry out the law.",
      "For a couple of months now, Toby Schindelbeck and Stephanie Taber, among others, have been asking council and Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy to provide a simple accounting of city finances, as is required by the city charter, and she just plain refuses to give it. City Mangler Dave Burkland won’t make her. Last month she actually admitted, she is UNABLE to do it. At the June 5 meeting she admitted that she is incompetent to follow the city charter. She said that when she came to her position seven years ago, she “struggled” with doing such a report – something every house wife does – and went whining to then-city-manager Tom Lando, who apparently patted her on the head and told her she didn’t have to do it anymore. I don’t know about you guys, but I go over my check book every month, just to make sure everything is straight. I’ve found big, dumb mistakes, in the 100’s column even, that could have caused big, dumb problems down the road. I’m no math instructor, like Mary Goloff, but it’s not exactly rocket science – you just add your deposits and subtract your checks and withdrawals. I’ll admit, when my kids were little, I felt like I never had time to do that, and stuff would get screwed up. So now that I’ve got time, I make it a regularly scheduled event, and it’s amazing how much easier it is. And, I can keep the figures in my head, I know essentially how much I can afford to spend when I’m at the grocery store, or what kind of activities we can plan. My husband and son are enjoying a weekend trip right now that is already paid for, thankyouverymuch. But Jennifer Hennessy is unable to do that? And she has expectable stuff – over 80 percent of her budget is payroll. She doesn’t have that many emergencies. The biggest emergency she’s had lately, is that the state has taken back the fund she’s been mis-using – the RDA. She was paying salaries and benefits out of a fund that’s supposed to be reserved for emergency public works projects. In other words, she’s been dipping into the till to pay her own salary!",
      "While he’s sitting down there under the air conditioner vent at Head Start in a fresh shirt and manicure, the streets are going unmaintained, the classrooms overcrowded, the police and fire departments underfunded – is that the problem Mr. Samayoa? “The way we’re continuing to go, it’s just going to be a dying city, even if the economy picks up,” he said. Now, that statement doesn’t even make sense. This is a typical example of scare tactics. “The way we’re continuing to go…” You mean, paying $100,000+ salaries to fat bureaucrats, while cutting services to the public? Somehow I don’t think that’s what he’s talking about. ” …it’s just going to be a dying city…” Wow, what an idiot – obviously no knowledge of local history. Marysville has been through so many booms and busts, it ought to be called “Bouncyville.” If you get to know Marysville, you see it has everything needed to be a wonderful place to live, in good times and bad, regardless of carpetbaggers like Samayoa. “Give folks the opportunity to have this debate,” Mr. Samayoa suggests. Sounds like the rhetoric coming from Andy Holcombe and the rest of the sales tax increase proponents. Hey, that’s a swell idea! People should talk about these things, hash them out. And then, if enough of them sign a petition to put such a proposal on a legal ballot, well, they can VOTE on it! But that costs alot of money – best for those who really believe in this cockamamie idea to get the petition first, show the need to spend all that money on an election. That’s what rational people would do, anyway. But if you ask Holcombe to discuss the pending proposal, he denies there is any such thing. The only member of Chico City Council who is willing to discuss this proposal at all has been Mark Sorensen – thanks Mark. At least Mark has been good enough to answer our questions about the mechanics of such a proposal and getting it onto the ballot. Evans and Holcombe have both denied knowing anything about it, although Holcombe has made it good and clear he’d support raising the sales tax and Evans has been seen at Chamber discussions on the matter."

      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches.

Fig. \\ref{fig:each_activity_cognitive_assessment} shows the cognitive impairment status prediction accuracy for each modality (activity feature, EDA and HRV) per individual complex activity.\n\\subsection{Discussion}\nIf we exclude the postural activities from automated activity performance scoring, we find reduced statistical correlation with original task completeness performance for \\{NCI, MCI, CI\\} participant group (INT 0.53*, SEQ 0.21' and unsupervised 0.49').

DAVIES: The apocalyptic vision of a world in grief and individual rights in crisis has nothing to do with a Luddite mentality, and it would be very dangerous for the people in this room to link the two together. I, for one, believe in technology. I am very grateful for it, and I think the world is a better place for it. I have great faith in the future, but technology's not a silver lining for the future. It's not an El Dorado, it's more like plutonium. The very great thing that technology does for all of us can also be used by the people who would repress our freedoms and all I am saying is be aware of that. Let's not marginalize people like me, who are saying, Hey look, we are going to have 15 billion people on the planet. We are going to have a political inversion, you know, that is going to create massive tensions that are going to repress our rights, or at least create a tension that we have never known before. Don't marginalize me -- don't shoot the messenger. I believe in technology, so please don't equate the apocalypse with Ludditism -- the two do not match. LIASSON: We're about out of time. I'm going to turn this over to Lance. HOFFMAN: Thank you, Mara. I'm really unhappy that we are out of time, but I feel that we have a contract to those who want to leave in a moment or two. Those who want to stay, can stay up here, are welcome to continue, until the hotel throws us out. Since Lu Kleppinger is in the room at the moment, I don't know when that will be, but we can probably have it for a little while. I just want to make a couple of comments before I formally close this meeting. We have seen an awful lot happen in these last three days and there has been building, and indeed we will be continuing to some extent the work that Jim Warren started at CFP-1 -- a sense of community.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "And I am talking about an economic restructuring that results in a much more decentralized society, and social restructuring in an affirmation of the simple right to be left alone. I think Cyberspace is good for individuals, and I think that's important. I also think that the flip side of the coin, the creation of community, which we so sorely lack in this country today, can be facilitated through these technologies. I have experienced that for myself, as many of you have on your various computer networks on conferencing systems like the WELL. It is enormously liberating to overcome the artificial boundaries of space and time. We are prisoners of geography in the physical world, and our communities are largely a product of who we can see face to face each day, even though our real comrades and colleagues may be scattered all over the world and our interests -- whether they are hobbies or political interests or religious interests, whatever they might be -- can be facilitated if we are able to get in touch with, to form bonds with, to exchange views and ideas with other kindred spirits. And I believe this technology is an enabling technology for the formation of community. My hope is that we will have the wisdom to create policies which enable individuals to flourish free from the chains of mass society, and which enable voluntary communities of people, individuals, groups who come together to be with each other and to work together. I hope both of those become possible. DAVIES: I feel very warmed by the various visions of the future that have come out of this conference, but I am a cynic, and cynicism is good, because it adds fiber. (laughter) How nice the world would be if everyone was like Mitch, but they're not, because the future is in the hands of ruthless, greedy little men. I want to paint the vision of the future that I have, and I hope it's not too depressing because there is a future, a good future... possibly. I agree, as many of you do, that the future is going to be like some giant informational Yggdrasil* *Reference from Old Norse mythology -- the Yggdrasil was a giant ash tree whose roots held together the universe.. We'll all be part of interconnectivity, the likes of which we can scarcely imagine right now.",
      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society."

      "The Land Trust said it hopes to name the new nature refuge in honor of William Hawthorne of Hadlyme, whose family has owned the property for several generations and who has agreed to sell the property to the Land Trust at a discount from its market value if the rest of the money necessary for the purchase can be raised by the Land Trust. “This new wildlife preserve will represent a triple play for habitat conservation,” said Anthony Irving, chairman of the Land Trust’s Preservation Committee. “First, it helps to protect the watershed feeding the fragile Whalebone Cove eco-system, which is listed as one of North America’s important freshwater tidal marshes in international treaties that cite the Connecticut River estuary as a wetland complex of global importance. Whalebone Creek, one of the primary streams feeding Whalebone Cove, originates from vernal pools and upland swamps just south of the Hawthorne tract on the Land Trust’s Ravine Trail Preserve and adjacent conservation easements and flows through the proposed preserve. Virtually all of the Hawthorne property comprises much of the watershed for Whalebone Creek. “Second, the 82 acres we are hoping to acquire with this fund raising effort represents a large block of wetlands and forested wildlife habitat between Brush Hill and Joshuatown roads, which in itself is home to a kaleidoscope of animals from amphibians and reptiles that thrive in several vernal pools and swamp land, to turkey, coyote, bobcat and fisher. It also serves as seasonal nesting and migratory stops for several species of deep woods birds, which are losing habitat all over Connecticut due to forest fragmentation. “Third, this particular preserve will also conserve a key link in the wildlife corridors that connects more than 1,000 acres of protected woodland and swamp habitat in the Hadlyme area.” Irving explained that the preserve is at the center of a landscape-scale wildlife habitat greenway that includes Selden Island State Park, property of the US Fish & Wild Life’s Silvio O Conte Wildlife Refuge, The Nature Conservancy’s Selden Preserve, and several other properties protected by the Lyme Land Conservation Trust.",
      "“Because of its central location as a hub between these protected habitat refuges,” said Irving, “this preserve will protect forever the uninterrupted access that wildlife throughout the Hadlyme landscape now has for migration and breeding between otherwise isolated communities and families of many terrestrial species that are important to the continued robust bio-diversity of southeastern Connecticut and the Connecticut River estuary.” Irving noted that the Hawthorne property is the largest parcel targeted for conservation in the Whalebone Cove watershed by the recently developed US Fish & Wildlife Service Silvio O Conte Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan. Irving said the Land Trust hopes to create a network of hiking trails on the property with access from both Brush Hill Road on the east and Joshuatown Road on the west and connection to the Land Trust’s Ravine Trail to the south and the network of trails on the Nature Conservancy’s Selden Preserve. Irving said there is strong support for the Land Trust’s proposal to preserve the property both within the Hadlyme and Lyme communities and among regional and state conservation groups. He noted letters of support have come from the Hadlyme Garden Club, the Hadlyme Public Hall Association, the Lyme Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Agency, the Lyme Planning and Zoning Commission, the Lyme Open Space Committee, the Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments, the Lyme Garden Club, the Lyme Public Hall, The Nature Conservancy, The Silvio O Conte Refuge, the Connecticut River Watershed Council, and the Friends of Whalebone Cove, Inc.\nHe reported that between Hawthorne’s gift and several other pledges the Land Trust has already received commitments of 25 percent of the cost of the property.\nFiled Under: Lyme, Outdoors, Top Story, vnn Old Lyme Tree Commission Celebrates Arbor Day April 29, 2016 by admin Leave a Comment Members of the three groups gather around the new oak tree.

      "A new community conservation group to protect Whalebone Cove, a freshwater tidal marsh along the Connecticut river in Hadlyme recognized internationally for its wildlife habitat, will hold its first organizational meeting this coming Sunday, March 6, at 4 p.m.\nCalling the group “Friends of Whalebone Cove” (FOWC), the organizers say their purpose is to “create a proactive, community-based constituency whose mission is to preserve and protect the habitat and fragile eco-systems of Whalebone Cove.”\nMuch of Whalebone Cove is a nature preserve that is part of the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge (www.fws.gov/refuge/silvio_o_conte) under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFW). The Refuge owns and manages 116 acres of marshland in Whalebone Cove and upland along its shores. Prior to being taken over by USFW, the Whalebone Cove preserve was under the protection of The Nature Conservancy. As part of the Connecticut River estuary, the Cove is listed in the Ramsar Convention on International Wetlands (www.ramsar.org) as tidal marshlands on the Connecticut River that constitute a “wetlands complex of international importance.” The Ramsar citation specifically notes that Whalebone Cove has one of the largest stands of wild rice in the state. Except at high tide, most of the Cove is open marshland covered by wild rice stands with relatively narrow channels where Whalebone Creek winds its way through the Cove to the main stem of the Connecticut River. Brian Slater, one of the group’s leaders who is filing the incorporation documents creating FOWC, said the creation of the organization was conceived by many of those living around the Cove and others in the Hadlyme area because of increased speeding motor boat and jet ski traffic in the Cove in recent years, damaging wetland plants and disrupting birds and other wildlife that make the Cove their home. Slater said “Our goal is to develop a master plan for protection of the Cove through a collaborative effort involving all those who have a stake in Whalebone Cove – homeowners along its shores and those living nearby, the Silvio O. Conte Refuge, the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (DEEP), hunters, fishing enthusiasts, canoeing and kayaking groups, Audubon groups, the Towns of Lyme and East Haddam, The Nature Conservancy, the Connecticut River Watershed Council, the Lyme Land Conservation Trust, the Connecticut River Gateway Commission, and others who want to protect the Cove.”\n“Such a plan”, said Slater, “should carefully evaluate the habitat, plants, wildlife and eco-systems of the Cove and the surrounding uplands and watershed and propose an environmental management plan that can be both implemented and enforced by those entrusted with stewarding the Cove and its fragile ecosystems for the public trust.”\nFOWC has written a letter to Connecticut DEEP Commissioner Rob Klee asking that he appoint a blue ribbon commission to conduct the research and develop the management plan."

      "To the surprise of many, the Christian began continuously saying, \"I have given my hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam, I have my given hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) . . .. \"\nWhen asked about his behavior, the Christian said that as Huzoor Mufti-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) commanded him for the final time to say that he has given his hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu), he actually saw two bright hands emerging from Hazrat's hands and the Christian says that he is sure that these hands were none other the mubarak hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu). That Christian then asked Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) for forgiveness and explained to him what his true intentions were. He immediately accepted Islam and became a Mureed. The news of this Karaamat spread far and wide and thousands of Christians accepted Islam at Hazrat's hands. Subhan-Allah! This incident was narrated by Hazrat Moulana Abdul Hamid Palmer Noori Razvi, a close Khalifa of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Huzoor Sayyidi Sarkaar Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Mazaar Shareef is situated in Mohalla Saudagran, Bareilly Shareef. Every year thousands of Mureeds and lovers of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) present themselves at Bareilly Shareef for his Urs Mubaarak. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Mureedeen were not only ordinary people but his Mureeds also consisted of great Ulema, Muftis, Mufassirs, Poets, Philosophers, Professors, Doctors, etc. It is said that he has millions of Mureedeen. In India - Mufas'sire Azam Hind Hazrat Ibrahim Raza (radi Allahu anhu); Hazrat Maulana Tahseen Raza Khan; Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu); Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari; Muhadithe Kabeer Hazrat Maulana Mufti Zia Ul Mustapaha Sahib; Hazrat Maulana Arshadul Qaadri Sahib. His Eminence, Shaikh Mufti Mohammad Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari Al-Qaderi, was born on the 25th of Safar in the year 1942 in Bareilly, the citadel of spirituality and learning.",
      "The Wahabi Maulvi immediately repented and became Mureed of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Each year, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to go to Calcutta for missionary work. The Pope used to also visit Calcutta and although he received good coverage in the media, very few Christians turned up to meet the Pope. The Christians of Calcutta became very jealous whenever Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) visited that city as, without any news coverage, he attracted thousands of people who came to see him. The Christians decided to insult Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and lower his personality in the eyes of the people. They trained three Christians to approach Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) with the pretence that they were going to become his Mureeds. This was their plan: Whenever Hazrat was going to make any person his Mureed, he would ask the person to say, \"Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu).\" The Christians where then going to say that Hazrat is a liar (Allah forbid) since that was not the hand of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu)! The three Christians, now disguised as Muslims went to Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) with the pretence of becoming his Mureed. When two of the Christians saw Hazrat's noorani face they became afraid of carrying out their plans, but the third Christian, who was very stubborn, decided to carry out the plan. He sat in front of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and Hazrat proceeded with making him a Mureed. When Hazrat said, \"Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu),\" he said, \"I am giving my hand in the hand of Mufti-e-Azam.\" He was implying that Hazrat was asking him to lie when he was made to say a moment ago that he is not going to lie. Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) again commanded him to say, \"Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu).\" He again said, \"I am giving my hand in the hand of Mufti-e-Azam.\"\nHuzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) came into a Jalaal (Spiritual Anger) state and said, \"Say that you are giving your hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu).\"",
      "When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior. \"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality. Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind\" but he was also known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam\" or The Grand Mufti of the World.",
      "Those present thought that the Chaadar had just got caught between Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers. They tried to remove the Chaadar from between his fingers but it would not move. The first person to notice this Karaamat was Hazrat Allamah Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari. He showed this to everyone. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers did not move until the area was properly covered. \"Zinda hojate he jo marte he haq ke Naam par, Allah, Allah Maut ko kis ne Masiha Kardiya\"\n\"Janaaze se utha kar haath Pakri Chaadare Aqdas, He too Zinda He ye Zinda Karaamat Mufti e Azam\"\nAs he had wished, the Janaza Salaah of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was performed by Maulana Sayed Mukhtar Ashraf Jilani at the Islamia Inter College grounds in Bareilly Shareef. Two and a half million (2 500 000) Muslims attended his Janazah Salaah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) is buried on the left-hand-side of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). Those who lowered Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) in his Qabr Shareef have stated that they were continously wiping out perspiration from the forehead of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) right up to the last minute. \"Maangne Waala sub kuch paaye rota aaye hasta Jaaye\", \"Ye He Unki Adna Karamat Mufti Azam Zinda Baad\"\nWealth, presidency, minister ship, worldly satisfaction and happiness can be given to a person by anyone, but such people do not have the spiritual insight to give tranquility to a disturbed heart and they cannot put a smile onto the face of a depressed person. But Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave both the treasures of the physical world and the spiritual worlds to those in need. To be his servant was not less than kingship. Every day hundreds and thousands of people in need of spiritual, physical and academic needs would come to him and each one of them returned with complete satisfaction. \"Jhuki Hai Gardane Dar Par Tumhare, Taaj Waalo Ki, Mere Aqa Mere Maula Wo Taajul Auliyah Tum Ho\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) is that light of such an illustrious family whose radiance reflected itself in his character and manners that he displayed - such qualities that very few would be able to reach perfection."

      "That year, Rubio favored a bill changing the Miami-Dade County charter, which failed to pass because of a single “no” vote in the Senate. Burt cast the vote. Angered by what he saw as Burt’s betrayal, Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill. “When I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,” Rubio told The Miami Herald. It’s not certain that the full Legislature would have passed the bill had it made it to a floor vote. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders over years who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Most cited privacy concerns. But prescription monitoring databases in Florida and other states free to use Florida’s model would have pinpointed rogue doctors, would-be pill mills and doctor-shoppers across the country, just as all three were beginning to converge. In doing so, it could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem, not the monster it would become. Only weeks after the 2002 bill was killed, Bush suppressed a sob as he discussed his daughter’s arrest for forging a prescription. Court-ordered to drug treatment and then briefly to jail, Noelle Bush survived her pill addiction. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue’s million-dollar obligation to pay for it. Between 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, and late 2011, when the database finally came online, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners’ reports show. “Not getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,” said Burt. “There was heartache for thousands of families beyond measure and it didn’t have to happen.”\nFlorida Officials Were Told Of The Oxy Express\nThe East Kentucky hills and valleys of Greenup County suit Keith Cooper, a long-haired undercover cop-turned-sheriff: “It’s a backwater.",
      "Skidmore was wary of opioid painkillers, though, one reason her willingness in 2009 to work with Purdue was surprising. But she did it to get Florida’s dormant drug monitoring database up and running. Then a state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties, Skidmore recalled that, “They came to me and said, ‘Could you help get it across the finish line?’ ”\nOxyContin and prescription opioids, a serious problem in 2002, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years. Broward alone had more pain clinics than it had McDonald’s. Deaths tied to oxycodone had exploded, up by 263 percent since the prescription monitoring database had first been proposed and killed. Overdoses from prescription opioids were claiming more than seven lives a day. “By God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it,” Skidmore said. Skidmore believed a database wasn’t going to resolve the underlying addiction crisis. Still, it was a start. Not a silver bullet, but “maybe silver buckshot,” she said. The database law passed with gaping loopholes. No health care professional would have to report opioid prescriptions or check the database before prescribing more, and the state refused to pay for it. “Just to get that one little piece … took nine years of filing bills and then it had no teeth,” Skidmore said. “And it should have been the easiest piece.” Where Was The DEA and Everyone Else? The DEA all but wrung its hands over Florida’s lethal inaction. The agency ticked off a devil’s brew of regulatory loopholes: Florida’s Health Department regulated health care professionals but not pain clinics. The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration regulated pain clinics that accepted insurance, but pill mills were most often on a cash-only basis. And the prescription monitoring database, mired in a vendor dispute, remained stalled. In early 2011, when Gov. Rick Scott took office, just one drug — oxycodone — was tied to six fatal overdoses a day.",
      "Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse. Ohio’s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky’s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent. The DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation’s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida’s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma’s renewed offer to help pay for it. Scott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it. Attorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott’s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida’s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law. Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, “because (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place. Right?” In Greenup, an infuriated Cooper told a reporter, “In my opinion, (Scott’s) getting money from somewhere. He has to be.” A few days later, recalled Cooper, “A lieutenant with the state police I’d been talking to down there called me, said, ‘Man, just a head’s up: I wouldn’t come to Florida.’”",
      "In states on the receiving end of the Florida pill pipeline and among federal officials, Scott’s resistance triggered outrage. In Kentucky, where as much as 60 percent of the illicit oxycodone in that state flowed from Florida, Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo proposed erecting billboards at the Florida line: “Welcome to the Oxy Tourism Capital of the World.”\nU.S. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, also from Kentucky, twice wrote Scott. “Canceling Florida’s prescription drug monitoring program is equal to firing firefighters while your house is ablaze,” he wrote. Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, asked to meet with Scott. So did DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. Three U.S. senators — New York’s Chuck Schumer, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Rhode Island’s Sheldon Whitehouse — joined Florida’s Bill Nelson in pointing out that the pills weren’t just a Florida problem: There were “serious ramifications for the rest of the country,” wrote Nelson of Scott’s reluctance to crack down. This is a perfect example of how political rhetoric, in-fighting and contrived agendas prevented an early stop to the emerging opioid crisis many years ago. WHY DIDN’T THE DEA, DRUG DISTRIBUTORS AND PHARMACIES TAKE NOTICE BEFORE THE OPIOID CRISIS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE WILDFIRE? WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE BILLIONS IN PROFITS, QUARTERLY BONUSES AND DIVIDENDS? STOCK OPTIONS CASHED IN BY BOARDROOMS AT EVERY OPIOID BIG PHARMA COMPANY? STAY TUNED FOR HOW “PROFITS BEFORE PATIENTS” BECAME THE NORM\n(article excerpts and quotes have been taken from publicly available media sources and court records)"

      "contour completion problem . Different types of lines and curves have been studied to maximize the connectivity of two broken ends in the planer contour completion problem. Geometry-based constraints can be utilized to address some challenges of contour completion problems, such as smoothness and curvature consistency . However, such approaches only work for simple, smooth contours and usually fail in more complex settings. On the other hand, we currently have deep models that could easily take an incomplete image and complete the missing regions using enough training data . The amazing capability of such models especially those that are trained on different modalities with millions or billions of training data raises the question of whether we need such a large amount of training to perceive all the visual cues that are present in an image, which underlies visual perception by humans. In human vision, Gestalt psychology suggests that our brain is designed to perceive structures and patterns that are grouped by some known rules. In this work, we show that some perceptual structures can also be learned from the image itself directly using architectures that enable such learning. Earlier work has shown  This is an extraordinary capability of our human brain and in this paper, we tried to see whether convolutional neural networks can show such capabilities. that some forms of perceptual grouping can be achieved using computational models, such as stochastic completion fields . This type of learning resonates with some of the Gestalt perceptual grouping principles including \"proximity\", \"good continuation\" and \"similarity\". In scenarios where color and/or texture are present, the cue of \"similarity\" helps us group regions with consistent patterns . When color and texture are present, they provide a collection of rich information for such cues. In the present article, we probe convolutional neural networks in a scenario where both are absent, and the neural network is dealing with just forms and shapes.",

This work investigates whether such capability can arise in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using deep structural priors computed directly from images. In this work, we present a framework that completes disconnected contours and connects fragmented lines and curves. In our framework, we propose a model that does not even need to know which regions of the contour are eliminated. We introduce an iterative process that completes an incomplete image and we propose novel measures that guide this to find regions it needs to complete. Our model trains on a single image and fills in the contours with no additional training data. Our work builds a robust framework to achieve contour completion using deep structural priors and extensively investigate how such a model could be implemented. Introduction\n\nThe human visual system is used to seeing incomplete outlines. Our brains can effortlessly group visual elements and fragmented contours that seem to be connected to each other. This power enables us to make shapes, organize disconnected visual features, and even properties of 3D surfaces when projected on 2D planes.\ndemonstrated how early vision may quickly complete partially-occluded objects using monocular signals. This capability of perceptual grouping has been studied in vision science for decades .

      "Therefore, these two aspects comprehensively influence the material diffusion between the two fluids. Due to the complex reflected shock wave, the global mixing degree shows a tendency for oscillating growth. Effects of specific-heat ratio on TNE behaviors\n\nThe investigation of TNE behaviors is of great importance for understanding the kinetics process on SBI. These TNE quantities describe the fluid system deviating from the thermodynamic state from their own perspectives. The effects of specific-heat ratio on global TNE strength, i.e., D * 2 , D * 3 , D * 3,1 , and D * 4,2 , are shown in Fig. . It can be seen that the effects of specific-heat ratios on various TNE quantities are different. Theoretically, the influence of specific-heat ratio on the non-equilibrium effect is reflected in two aspects: transport coefficient and macroscopic quantity gradient. For example, on the one hand, the specific-heat ratio reduces heat conductivity, while on the other hand, it enhances the temperature gradient. Therefore, the effect of specific heat ratio on NOEF is the comprehensive result of the competition between the two aspects. As shown in Fig. , the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the stronger strength of D * 3,1 . It indicates that the specific-heat ratio increase the strength of D * 3,1 by raising the heat conductivity . For the strength of D * 3 , as shown in Fig. (b), it is seen that it decreases as the specific-heat ratio becomes small. The reason is that a smaller specific-heat ratio decreases the temperature gradient. Effects of specific-heat ratio on D * 4,2 show two-stage. In the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the smaller specificheat ratio, the larger the strength of D * 4,2 . But the situation is reversed at the stage t > 0.03. For strength of D * 2 , the specificheat effects are more significant in later stage. Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production rate\n\nand entropy production The concepts of entropy are commonly used in complex flows . In DBM, there are two kinds of en- tropy production rates, i.e., ṠNOEF and ṠNOMF .",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Two kinds of analysis methods, including tracer particle method and two-fluid model, are used to characterize qualitatively the macroscopic behaviors such as the shape, deformation process, mixing degree, etc. The related TNE behaviors are also studied. Effects of specific-heat ratio on jet shape, deformation process, and average motion\n\nWe first observe the specific-heat ratio effect on the bubble shape from the view of density contour and images of particle tracer visually. As shown in Fig. , pictures with three typical moments are plotted, i.e., t = 0.07,t = 0.11, and t = 0.16. The odd rows represent density contours and the even rows are tracer particle images. It can be seen that the specific-heat ratio significantly affects the length and shape of the jet structure. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. The reason is that the specific-heat ratio significantly changes the propagation speed of shock waves and wave patterns inside the bubble. The specific-heat ratio also influences the vortex structure in early stage but contributes little effects to it in later stage. In the later stage, for cases with different specific-heat ratios, the differences in vortex pairs are almost invisible. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on deformation process are analyzed. Shown in Fig. are the evolutions of characteristic scales which used to describe the bubble size, i.e., width and length. It can be seen that the smaller the specific-heat ratio of bubble, the smaller the bubble width and length. For the fluid with smaller specific-heat ratio, it is easier to be compressed. Therefore, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. It can also be seen that the case with the largest specific-heat ratio reaches the minimum characteristic scales firstly. The reason is that the shock wave propagates faster in case with larger specific-heat ratio. Through the method of tracer, information on the average motion of the bubble is easy to obtain.",
      "Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. The effects of specific-heat ratio on various TNE quantities show interesting differences. These differences consistently show the complexity of TNE flows which is still far from clear understanding. Introduction\n\nThe applications of shock-accelerated inhomogeneous flows (SAIFs) are of significant value in biomedicine, energy utilization, and astrophysics fields, including but not limited to scenarios such as the impact of shock waves on kidney stones, the interaction between shock waves with foams, the impacting of detonation wave with burning flames in supersonic combustion systems, the formation of supernova remnants, etc . Shock-bubble interaction (SBI) is one of the most fundamental problems in the research of SAIFs. Its applications and academic research are interdisciplinary. Generally, there are two kinds of problems encountered in SBI research: (i) The geometry of shock waves, the shape of material interfaces, and the structure of container are complex in the actual scene. They will result in various wave patterns and significantly affect the flow morphology and bubble's evolution. (ii) There usually exist multi-physics coupling problem in the engineering application of SBI. Such as the supersonic combustion machines. When the shock waves passing through the reactants, it may lead to phase transition and chemical reactions, making the flow morphology more complex and inducing small structure (or fast-changing pattern) . In an underwater explosion experiment, the interaction between shock waves and bubbles may refer to the cavitation and annihilation effects. The other scene is the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), in which the laser ablation, electron heat conduction, self-generated electromagnetic field, radiation, and many other factors may complicate the investigation of hydrodynamic instabilities . Commonly, research on SBI mainly includes three methods: theoretical derivation, experiment, and numerical simulation.",
      "The larger the difference in specific-heat ratio between the bubble and ambient gas, the higher the degree of material mixing. Effects of specific-heat ratio on various TNE quantities are different. These differences consistently show the complexity of TNE flows which is still far from a clear understanding. In addition, it is found that the temporal evolution of the entropy production rates ṠNOMF and ṠNOEF both show three stages because of the influence of the shock wave location. The smaller the specific-heat ratio, the larger the velocity gradient, which indirectly enhances the strength of ṠNOMF . The specific-heat ratio increases the ṠNOEF by raising the temperature gradient. The influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with reduced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. When the specific-heat ratio γ is smaller than a threshold value γ c (γ c ≈ 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of γ > γ c , the situation reverses. The fundamental research in this paper helps to understand the interaction mechanism between shock waves and bubbles in ICF, supersonic combustors, underwater explosions, etc. The effects of viscosity and heat conduction on the interaction between shock waves and bubbles will be studied in the following work. where the subscript \"m, n\" means that the m-order tensor is contracted to n-order tensor. According to the CE multiscale analysis, the Boltzmann-BGK equation can be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations. In the following part, the derivation process from Boltzmann-BGK equation to a two-fluid hydrodynamic equation are shown. More details can see the reference presented by Zhang et al. ."

      "A Homily from Easter Sunday, 2017. Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look[a] into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew,[b] “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary wept in the throws of grief. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary dragged herself out of bed after a sleepless night and walked to the tomb in a kind of trance. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary cried—scared, confused, alone. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary thought that the powers of death had the last Word. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary heard a voice in the darkness calling her name—Mary. Throughout this Lenten season, we’ve examined the ways that the powers and principalities hold us captive—how they push us towards securing our own survival, dominating others, using God for our own agenda.",
      "No. God doesn’t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. God doesn’t will for us to do evil or to harm other people. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death. This post was adapted from my sermon preached at Butner Federal Prison on September 14, 2014. We were gathered at the plaza, right between the giant bull statue and the unattractive fences of a construction site. Luminary bags weighted with rice and lit candles marked the sacred space surrounding 30 of us, one to represent each person who died as a result of domestic violence the previous year in our state. The vigil began as planned, simple, but meaningful, to remember victims of this tragedy and raise awareness about the suffering that takes place behind closed doors. About halfway through the simple service, a woman stumbled into the vigil, interrupting the solemn mood without realizing that a group was gathered and someone was speaking. She stood silent for a few moments, listening to the speaker. When she realized that the speaker was talking about domestic violence, she began to interrupt, asking questions to the speaker, sharing details from her own experience with abuse. “What would you do…what would you do if…?” she cried. Then, as unexpectedly as she joined us and as abruptly as her interruption, she began to weep, uncontrollably crying for the rest of the vigil. A couple of women gathered around her and held her as she wept. Before long, it was my turn to pray. I barely got the words out…I could hardly project my shaking voice over her loud sobs. “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,” Jesus proclaims in the second line of the beatitudes. Blessed are those who mourn. How is this weeping woman, this victim of abuse, blessed? She mourns the injustices she’s experienced, her suffering, the ways her life has been shaped by pain and her inability to free herself from her oppression.",
      "We’ve seen how in Jesus’ ministry, he’s constantly in resistance mode—exposing the powers for what they really are and envisioning an alternative way of living in the world. He describes this way as “the kingdom of God,” the living water we drink so we never thirst again, the light of the world. Jesus invites those who follow him into similar acts of resistance—to free us from the power money has on us by giving it away, to choose to see ourselves as Jesus sees us, resisting the shame that says I’m not enough, to practice Sabbath that contradicts productivity, to untie the grave clothes of someone who’s hands and feet are still tied in the trappings of death. But all Jesus’ acts of resistance had a cost. All of the times he just wouldn’t shut up, all of the crowds he attracted because he actually noticed those who were normally ignored, the powers finally said enough is enough and put an end to his resistance the only way they could guarantee silence and division—by nailing him to a tree. Just then, she turned and saw a man the shadow of a man behind her; a man she assumed was the gardener, his face unfamiliar in the darkness. He repeated the question—“Woman, why are you crying?” Thinking that perhaps he knew what happened or worse, that he was a culprit, she begged, “Sir if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will get him.” But Jesus interrupted her pleading, interrupted her desperation, and called her by name from the darkness, Mary.\nMary. He calls her name. Her name. The name that captures the particularity of her life. To the gardener, she would just be the crying woman. At other points in her life, she was the possessed woman, the woman who wasn’t enough, the woman on the outside of the group. Never nameless—but still unnamed. Never not Mary, but still, not known. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, God defeated the powers and principalities in the ultimate act of resistance—resurrection. The grave could not contain the Lord. Even death wasn’t enough.",
      "In the resurrection, God defeats the powers of death and shows that it’s God who has the final Word. Nothing, not even death, can keep us from being fully known by God. The powers try to have the final say on our names, our identities, the markers by which we measure ourselves, the systems that hold people captive or keep people in oppression. But Jesus calls us out of the darkness by name. On this Easter Sunday, we hear our Risen Lord calling our names from the darkness—Jesus, the resurrected one, the name above all names, the great I am, the Prince of Peace, the alpha and omega, the light of the world. The risen Lord has spoken. This is the name unto which you were baptized. As you come forward and mark the sign of the cross on your forehead today, hear Jesus speaking your name from the darkness and drawing you into the light. From our worship service on the fifth Sunday of Lent, April 2, 2017. “Is the Lord really with us or not?” “Is the Lord really with us or not?” Why did you bring us all the way from Egypt to let us die of thirst in this desert? At least in Egypt, we had water. At least in Egypt, we weren’t so thirsty. At least in Egypt, we knew what tomorrow would hold. At least in Egypt, we weren’t so thirsty. But no, that’s not the story they give us. They are hard on their ancestors. They tell how it is. The elders who sat and wrote down these stories understood something about our bodies, who we are and how we work. After all the generations these stories passed through, they tell the truth about how quickly we forget, about how quickly we complain, about how quickly we grow thirsty, about how much we need water. It doesn’t take long, does it. By the end of this sermon, I will no doubt feel thirsty, not from walking on hard dusty ground in the heat of the day, but just from speaking with you. Most of us wake up in the morning needing a drink. Our bodies depend on water. We cannot live without it. Thirst, then, doesn’t happen only one time. When the Israelites panicked that they had no water, they weren’t only thinking of the present moment."

      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations.",
      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling."

      "Mean blood mercury concentrations increased to 0.52 +/- 0.36 mg/kg (n = 44) after the completion of feather growth. Some individuals had reached adult blood mercury levels within three months of leaving the nest, but levels dropped to 0.20 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (n = 11) once the autumn molt had begun. Most studies of mercury contamination in juvenile birds have focused on recently hatched young with thousands of rapidly growing feathers. However, the highest risk period for mercury intoxication in young birds may be during the vulnerable period after fledging, when feathers no longer serve as a buffer against dietary mercury. We found that nestling blood mercury levels were not indicative of the extent of contamination because a large portion of the ingested mercury ended up in feathers. The present study demonstrates unequivocally that in songbirds blood mercury level is influenced strongly by the growth and molt of feathers.

We surveyed 118 patients from Aprilâ€“August 2012 about their seafood consumption patterns, specifically how frequently they were eating each type of fish, to assess mercury exposure. We also asked about symptoms associated with mercury toxicity including depression, fatigue, balance difficulties, or tingling around the mouth.

      "Objective: Examine the relationship between fish consumption, total, inorganic and organic blood Hg levels and urinary Hg concentration. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 171 persons from 7 riparian communities on the Tapajos River (Brazilian Amazon), with no history of inorganic Hg exposure from occupation or dental amalgams. During the rising water season in 2004, participants responded to a dietary survey, based on a seven-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency, and socio-demographic information was recorded. Blood and urine samples were collected. Total, organic and inorganic Hg in blood as well as U-Hg were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Results: On average, participants consumed 7.4 fish meals/week and 8.8 fruits/week. Blood total Hg averaged 38.6 Â± 21.7 Î¼g/L, and the average percentage of B-IHg was 13.8%. Average organic Hg (MeHg) was 33.6 Â± 19.4 Î¼g/L, B-IHg was 5.0 Â± 2.6 Î¼g/L, while average U-Hg was 7.5 Â± 6.9 Î¼g/L, with 19.9% of participants presenting U-Hg levels above 10 Î¼g/L. B-IHg was highly significantly related to the number of meals of carnivorous fish, but no relation was observed with non-carnivorous fish; it was negatively related to fruit consumption, increased with age, was higher among those who were born in the Tapajos region, and varied with community. U-Hg was also significantly related to carnivorous but not non-carnivorous fish consumption, showed a tendency towards a negative relation with fruit consumption, was higher among men compared to women and higher among those born in the region.

      "Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), including detailed information about consumption of different fish species, reflecting average intake during 1 year. We also determined inorganic mercury (I-Hg) in blood, and selenium (Se) in serum. The average total fish consumption, as reported in the food frequency questionnaire, was approximately 4 times/week (range 1.6-19 times/week). Fish species potentially high in MeHg, included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 79% of the women. About 10% consumed such species more than once a week, i.e., more than what is recommended. Other fish species potentially high in MeHg, not included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 54% of the women. Eleven percent never consumed fish species potentially high in MeHg. T-Hg in hair (median 0.70 mg/kg; range 0.08-6.6 mg/kg) was associated with MeHg in blood (median 1.7 Î¼g/L; range 0.30-14 Î¼g/L; r s =0.78; p s =0.32; p s =0.37; p s =0.35; p=0.002, respectively). I-Hg in blood (median 0.24 Î¼g/L; range 0.01-1.6 Î¼g/L) increased with increasing number of dental amalgam fillings. We found no statistical significant associations between the various mercury species measured and the Se concentration in serum. Hair mercury levels exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 Î¼g MeHg/kg b.w. per day in 20% of the women.

      "Strong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax. Allowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election. Prime Minister (2016–2017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016. English appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same. In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.

      "At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third. He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK). English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.",
      "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash. In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later."

      "\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec4}\n\nThis paper introduced the Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration technique for steady-state, monoenergetic transport in homogeneous slab geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first nonlinear HOLO method that accelerates \\textit{all $L$ moments} of the angular flux. Upon convergence, the LO and HO models are consistent; in other words, the (lower-order) modified Fokker-Planck equation \\textit{preserves the same angular moments} of the flux obtained with the (higher-order) transport equation. NFPA was tested on a homogeneous medium with an isotropic internal source with vacuum boundaries, and in a homogeneous medium with no internal source and an incoming beam boundary. For both problems, three different scattering kernels were used. The runtime and iterations of NFPA and FPSA were shown to be similar. They both vastly outperformed DSA and GMRES for all cases by orders of magnitude. However, NFPA has the feature of preserving the angular moments of the flux in both the HO and LO equations, which offers the advantage of integrating the LO model into multiphysics models. In the future, we intend to test NFPA capabilities for a variety of multiphysics problems and analyze its performance. To apply NFPA to more realistic problems, it needs to be extended to include time and energy dependence. Additionally, the method needs to be adapted to address geometries with higher-order spatial dimensions. Finally, for the NFPA method to become mathematically ``complete\", a full convergence examination using Fourier analysis must be performed. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper and must be left for future work. \\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nThe authors acknowledge support under award number NRC-HQ-84-15-G-0024 from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Here, we discuss the steps taken during the dissection procedure to minimize these problems.

The possible impact of other methodological factors on synaptic function in these animal models (e.g. recording solution components, stimulation parameters) are also discussed.

Institutions: North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina Central University, Durham, Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Proximal resistance vessels, such as the mesenteric arteries, contribute substantially to the peripheral resistance. These small vessels of between 100-400 μm in diameter function primarily in directing blood flow to various organs according to the overall requirements of the body. The rat mesenteric artery has a diameter greater than 100 μm. The myography technique, first described by Mulvay and Halpern1, was based on the method proposed by Bevan and Osher2. The technique provides information about small vessels under isometric conditions, where substantial shortening of the muscle preparation is prevented. Since force production and sensitivity of vessels to different agonists is dependent on the extent of stretch, according to active tension-length relation, it is essential to conduct contraction studies under isometric conditions to prevent compliance of the mounting wires."

      ", we found that all the models with encoded medical meta-information perform better in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L and BLEURT than the vanilla Longformer. However, in BERTScore, only hospital and disease models outperform the vanilla. Specifically, disease information is most effective, improving ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore and BLEURT by 4.45, 0.73, 3.12, 3.77 and 0.21 points over the vanilla model, respectively. This seems to be because disease information and the ICD-10 ontology efficiently cluster groups with similar representations. In contrast, in ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L, the model with physician embedding is inferior to the vanilla model. This seems to be a negative effect of grouping physicians without any consideration of their relevance. It would be better to cluster them by department, physician attributes, similarity of progress notes, etc. Regarding low ROUGE-2 scores in all models, a previous study using the English data set also reported a low ROUGE-2 score of about 5%, which may indicate an inherent difficulty in discharge summary generation. In BERTScore, the models with the physician and the length of stay did not reach the performance of the vanilla model, suggesting that the system's outputs are semantically inferior. The model with all features performed the lowest of all models in BERTScore. The reason for the low score of the model with all features seems to be that its number of parameters in feature embedding was four times larger than that of the model with the individual feature, and the amount of training data was insufficient. In BLEURT, all models with meta-information outperform vanilla, which suggests that they are more natural to humans. To analyze the influence of encoded meta-information on the outputs, we evaluate the precisions of the generated text. Specifically, we measure the probability that the generated words are included in the gold summary to investigate if the proper words are generated. Some previous studies on faithfulness, which also analyze the output of summarization, have employed words or entities - .",
      "In this study, we focused on words, not entities, because we wanted to visualize expressions that are not only nouns. The words were segmented by MeCab with the J-MeDic. For each segmented word, the numeral and symbol labels were assigned as parts of speech by MeCab, the morphological analyzer, while the disease and symptom were assigned by the J-Medic dictionary. The results, shown in Figure , indicate that the encoded disease information leads to generate more proper disease and symptom words. This indicates that the meta-information successfully learns disease-related expressions. The encoded hospital or physician information also improved the precision of symbols generation. This suggests that different hospitals and physicians have different description habits (e.g., bullet points such as \"•\", \"*\" and \"-\", punctuation such as \"。\" and \".\", etc.), which can be grouped by meta-information. In this paper, we conducted a discharge summary generation experiment by adding four types of information to Longformer and verified the impact of the meta-information. The results showed that all four types of information exceeded the performance of the vanilla Longformer model, with the highest performance achieved by encoding disease information. We found that meta-information is useful for abstractive summarization on discharge summaries. Our limitations are that we used Japanese EHR, the limited number of tested features and not performing human evaluations. As for the efficacy of the meta-information, we believe that our results are applicable to non-Japanese, but it is left as Fig. . The precisions of words in the generated summaries. The vertical axis shows the probability that the words exist in the gold summary. a future work. Other meta-information may be worth verifying such as the patient's gender, age, race, religion and used EHR system, etc. It is hard to collect a large amount of medical information and process it into meta-information, so we may need to develop a robust and flexible research infrastructure to conduct a more large scale cross-sectional study in the future.",
      "This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs. Our results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information. INTRODUCTION\n\nClinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , . Discharge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming. Researchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases. Therefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure.",
      "This takes all four feature embeddings (hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay) added to the encoder. Datasets and Metrics\n\nWe evaluated our proposed method on a subset of data from National Hospital Organization (NHO), the largest multiinstitutional organization in Japan. The statistics of our data are shown in Table  , which includes 24,630 cases collected from five hospitals. Each case includes a discharge summary and progress notes for the days of stay. The data are randomly split into 22,630, 1,000, and 1,000 for train, validation, and test, respectively. Summarization performances are reported in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L and BERTScore in terms of F1. In addition, we also employed BLEURT , which models human judgment. Architectures and Hyperparameters\n\nDue to our hardware constraints we need a model that is computationally efficient, so we employed the Longformer instead of the conventional transformer. Longformer can  . In our model, number of layers, window size, dilation, input sequence length, output sequence length, batch size, learning rate and number of warmup steps are 8, 256, 1, 1024, 256, 4, 3e-5 and 1K, respectively. Other hyperparameters are the same as in the original Longformer, except for the maximum number of epochs is not fixed and the best epoch. It is selected for each training using the validation data based on ROUGE-1. Also, the original Longformer imports pretrained-BART parameters to initial values, but we do not use pre-trained Japanese BART in this study. We used three GeForce RTX 2080 TI for our experiments. Our vocabulary for preparing input to Longformer is taken from UTH-BERT , which is pre-trained on the Japanese clinical records. Since the vocabulary of UTH-BERT is trained by WordPiece , we also tokenize our data with WordPiece. However, the vocabulary does not include white space and line breaks, which cannot be handled, so we add those two tokens to the vocabulary, resulting in a total size of 25,002. The vocabulary has all tokens in full characters, so we normalized full-wdith characters by converting all alphanumeric and symbolic characters to half-width for byte fallback.",

      "In other words, as the robot continually moves in space, the first hyperplane that it will cross upon exiting the polytope will correspond to one of the polytope's nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager outline an iterative method for removing redundant constraints by solving n linear programs. We use this method in practice for computing α j e for each polytope. We can now characterize each polytope by a vector α j e ∈ {−1, 1} n j e , where n j e ≤ n is the number of essential constraints of the polytope. The polytopes P j partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement. Path Preference\n\nIn this section, we provide a definition of preference θ according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition. Let G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector α j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane). Let N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m θ = v∈V |N (v)| be the cardinality of Θ, and m g = |Ω g | the number of possible goals. A priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m θ × m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent.",
      "Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space. Hyperplane Arrangement\n\nWe assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i ∈ R di×2 and b i ∈ R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.\n.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where α j i ∈ {−1, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i . Fig. : Intent inference model in a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle free space. We spatially decompose the preference θ into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j). We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and α j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and α j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope.",

      "Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints. However, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging. Prior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences. To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph. Each time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief. On the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal.",
      "In other words, the observations the human provides can be defined conditioned only on the robot location, the goal, and the human's preference for its current vertex p v . By introducing this assumption, each update step only requires updating the joint (p v , g), reducing the number of cost computations to |N (v)| × m g . We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of θ are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is\n, it is unlikely that the human will also prefer p v2 = (v 2 , v 1 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity of the inference problem. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to different homotopy classes will cross different sequences of polytopes, i.e. they correspond to a different sequence of edges on G.\nThis can be proved by contradiction. Let us suppose that two continuous trajectories ξ 1 and ξ 2 , with the same start and end points and that do not intersect any obstacle, traverse the same regions in G in the same order. From the construction of the hyperplane arrangement, each polytope that the paths traverse through is obstacle-free. Therefore, within each polytope, there is no obstacle in the area located in between the portions of ξ 1 and ξ 2 that belong to the region. A smooth transformation of ξ 1 into ξ 2 can be obtained by transforming each portion of ξ 1 belonging to the polytopes it intersects into the corresponding portion of ξ 2 for the same polytopes, where the extremities of the trajectory portions are connected to one another along the polytope's edges (where the same edge is crossed by both paths). Along this transformation, the paths do not intersect any obstacle, and therefore ξ 1 and ξ 2 belong to the same homotopy class."

      "These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the \"Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio\"), Mitch Berg and others. The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years. But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication. (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann. Sports Radio\nKSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010. As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox. As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period. One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change. In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center. It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz. The original translator was discontinued. On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as \"SKOR North\" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, \"Skol, Vikings\"), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff.",
      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band. Past Personalities\n\nNotable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand.",
      "Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point. National Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network. It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference.",
      "Station management cited the economic toll of the coronavirus for the changes. Sports broadcasting continues, primarily composed of ESPN radio network broadcasts. Sports Teams\n\nKSTP-AM served as the radio flagship for the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. On August 1, 2006, the station announced that it would be the new flagship station for the Minnesota Twins baseball team, effective with the start of the 2007 season. The Twins had been on rival WCCO since arriving in Minnesota in 1961. KSTP served as the flagship for the Twins until the end of the 2012 season, when games moved to 96.3 KTWN-FM (now KMWA). The Twins have since returned to WCCO 830. The switch to a fairly weak FM station caused dissent among some listeners, particularly in communities that had trouble picking up KSTP 1500. Although KSTP is the state's second most powerful AM station, it must operate directionally at night, delivering a reduced signal to parts of the market. WCCO, by comparison, offers a signal with a wider coverage area during the day than KSTP does, with WCCO's non-directional 50,000 watt signal. In response, the Twins have expanded the number of affiliates. On March 9, 2011, KSTP announced it would be the new flagship for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers men's and women's basketball and men's ice hockey, ending a 68-year run on WCCO.

      "Retirement\n\nGoodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States. Vice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.

      "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command. Early life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.",
      "Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner. He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator. Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King. In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937."

    "question": "A couple is found to both carry a genetic trait that increases the risk of their offspring developing a specific hemoglobin disorder.  Given that the disorder is characterized by severe anemia requiring lifelong blood transfusions, what is the probability that their child will inherit this condition, and which type of thalassemia is most likely to manifest in this way?",
    "choices": [
      "A) 0%, Hemoglobin H disease",
      "B) 25%, Alpha thalassemia major",
      "C) 25%, Beta thalassemia major",
      "D) 50%, Beta thalassemia intermedia"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts.",
      "Therefore, hemoglobin E is unique in that it is both a quantitative (i.e. thalassemia-like) and qualitative trait. When co-inherited with a beta thalassemia trait, it causes a disease that is almost indistinguishable from beta thalassemia disease. Large deletions around and including the beta globin gene can lead to delta/beta thalassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Interestingly, delta/beta thalassemia trait behaves very similarly to beta thalassemia trait in its clinical manifestations. However, HPFH trait does not tend to cause hemoglobin disease when co-inherited with a second thalassemia or other beta globin mutation. ALPHA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have four normal copies of the alpha globin gene, two copies on each chromosome 16. These genes make the alpha globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, which is called hemoglobin A. Alpha globin is also a component of fetal hemoglobin and the other major adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin A2. Mutations of the alpha globin genes are usually deletions of the gene, resulting in absent production of alpha globin. Since there are four genes (instead of the usual two) to consider when looking at alpha globin gene inheritance, there are several alpha globin types that are possible. Absence of one alpha globin gene leads to a condition known as silent alpha thalassemia trait. This condition causes no health problems and can be detected only by special genetic testing. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs when two alpha globin genes are missing. This can occur in two ways. The genes may be deleted from the same chromosome, causing the 'cis' type of alpha thalassemia trait. Alternately, they may be deleted from different chromosomes, causing the 'trans' type of alpha thalassemia trait. In both instances, there are no associated health problems, although the trait status may be detected by more routine blood screening. Hemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of three alpha globin genes, such that there is only one functioning gene.",
      "Thalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nThalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nhttps://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Thalassaemia+minor\n(redirected from Thalassaemia minor)\nRelated to Thalassaemia minor: thalassaemia major\nThalassemia describes a group of inherited disorders characterized by reduced or absent amounts of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red blood cells. There are two basic groups of thalassemia disorders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These conditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which can range from insignificant to life threatening. All types of thalassemias are considered quantitative diseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemoglobin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemoglobin is made up of three components: alpha globin, beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classified according to the globin that is affected, hence the names alpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of thalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and beta thalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Beta thalassemia may be the most best-known type of thalassemia and is also called Cooley's anemia. It is caused by a change in the gene for the beta globin component of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemia that can range from moderate to severe, depending in part on the exact genetic change underlying the disease. Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinical symptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe anemia that can occur within months after birth. If left untreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growth and development, as well as other common physical complications that can lead to a dramatically decreased life-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries beta thalassemia is usually identified by screening in the newborn period, before symptoms have developed. Children who are identified early can be started on ongoing blood transfusion therapy as needed.",
      "Typically, this can occur when one parent carries the silent alpha thalassemia trait, and the other parent carries the 'cis' type of the alpha thalassemia trait. In this situation, there is a 25% chance for hemoglobin H disease in each of such a couple's children. Hemoglobin H disease-like symptoms can also be a part of a unique condition called alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome. Alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome can be caused by a deletion of a significant amount of chromosome 16, affecting the alpha globin genes. This is usually not inherited, but rather occurs sporadically in the affected individual. Affected individuals have mild hemoglobin H disease, mild-to-moderate mental retardation, and characteristic facial features. This syndrome can also occur as a sex-linked form in which a mutation is inherited in a particular gene on the X-chromosome. This gene influences alpha globin production, as well as various other developmental processes. Individuals affected with this form of the syndrome tend to have more severe mental retardation, delayed development, nearly absent speech, characteristic facial features, and genital-urinary abnormalities. The remaining discussion will focus only on aspects of hemoglobin H disease. Alpha thalassemia major results from the deletion of all four alpha globin genes, such that there are no functioning alpha globin genes. This can occur when both parents carry the 'cis' type of the alpha thalassemia trait. In this situation, there is a 25% chance for alpha thalassemia major in each of such a couple's children. Beta thalassemia major is characterized by severe anemia that can begin months after birth. In the United States and other developed countries beta thalassemia is identified and treated early and effectively. Therefore, the following discussion of symptoms applies primarily to affected individuals in the past and unfortunately in some underdeveloped countries now. If untreated, beta thalassemia major can lead to severe lethargy, paleness, and delays in growth and development."

      "As a fundamental research method, theoretical research can provide a clear understanding of physical processes. In 1960, Rudinger et al. developed a theory that permits computing the response of bubbles to accelerations . In order to describe the formation and evolution processes of vortex structure quantitatively, many scholars have developed circulation models . However, theoretical works provide limited information. Meanwhile, in the late stage of SBI evolution, the bubble deformation and flow morphology dominated by the developed Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are difficult to be predicted accu-rately. As the research method closest to engineering application, the experimental results are often regarded as standard results to verify the rationality and accuracy of theoretical and numerical works. To study the SBI process accurately, the scholars have made a series of improvements to experimental equipment or technique, including the generation techniques of different types of shock waves, interface formation methods, schlieren facilities, and image recognition techniques . Among these, two of important and valuable works are performed by Ding et al.. Based on the soap film technique, they formed kinds of initial interfaces with different curvatures through the wire-restriction method and captured the wave patterns and interface evolution with high-speed schlieren photography . Other works, such as evolutions of a spherical gas interface under reshock conditions , developments of a membrane-less SF 6 gas cylinder under reshock conditions , and interactions of a cylindrical converging shock wave with an initially perturbed gaseous interface , are also performed by many other scholars. However, we know that the experimental studies mainly depend on the experimental platform. When studying some complex and demanding condition problems, it takes much work to build the experimental platform. In this situation, numerical simulation research becomes an option.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Generally, there are three kinds of physical modeling methods (or models) for SBI numerical research, i.e., the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic modeling methods. Most of the existing numerical researches on SBI are related to the macroscopic modeling methods (such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes (NS) models) based on the continuous hypothesis (or equilibrium and nearequilibrium hypothesis) . For example, presented the computational results on the evolution of the shock-accelerated heavy bubbles through the multi-fluid Eulerian equation . There also exist a few SBI works based on the mesoscopic modeling method, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method . The microscopic modeling methods such as the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is capable of capturing much more flow behaviors but restricted to smaller spatiotemporal scales because of its huge computing costs. In the numerical research on SBI, three points need to be concerned. (i) Investigation of kinetic modeling that describes the non-continuity/non-equilibrium flows. Most of the current researches are based on macroscopic models. However, there exist abundant small structure (and fast-changing patterns) behaviors and effects such as the shock wave, boundary layer, material defects, etc. For cases with small structures, the mean free path of molecules cannot be ignored compared to the characteristic length, i.e., the non-continuity (discreteness) of the system is pronounced, which challenge the rationality and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the continuity hypothesis. For cases with fast-changing patterns, the system dose not have enough time to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium state, i.e., the system may significantly deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Therefore, the rational-ity and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium (or near thermodynamic equilibrium) will be challenged. (ii) Improvement of method that describes the evolution characteristics of bubbles and flows morphology."

      "Compared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful. Because the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Response calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, ẏ) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), ẏ(t) and ÿ(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation. If the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (τ ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (τ 1 , . .",
      "When t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = −y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = −y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions. Conclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series. Once the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated.",

Introduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists. This work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations . To analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability ."

      "In summary, in a wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations, we have evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal decomposition leading to the formation of Mn-rich nanocolumns in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. This decomposition is probably the consequence of: $(i)$ a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms, $(ii)$ a strong surface diffusion of Mn atoms in germanium even at low growth temperatures and $(iii)$ layer by layer growth conditions. We have also investigated the influence of growth parameters on the spinodal decomposition: at low growth temperatures (100$^{\\circ}$C), increasing the Mn content leads to higher columns densities while at higher growth temperatures (150$^{\\circ}$C), the columns density remains nearly constant whereas their size increases drastically. By plotting the nanocolumns density as a function of Mn content, we have shown that the mechanism of Mn incorporation in Ge changes above 5 \\% of Mn. Finally, using TEM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C.\n\n\\section{Magnetic properties \\label{magnetic}}\n\nWe have thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films for different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. In this section, we focus on Mn concentrations between 2 \\% and 11 \\%. We could clearly identify four different magnetic phases in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films : diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix, low $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\leq$ 170 K), high $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\\geq$ 400 K) and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters ($T_{C}$ $\\thickapprox$ 300 K). The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature ($<$ 120$^{\\circ}$C), we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing T$_{g}$ above 120$^{\\circ}$C, we first obtain continuous columns exhibiting low $T_{C}$ ($<$ 170 K) and high $T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) for $T_{g}\\approx$130$^{\\circ}$C. The larger columns become ferromagnetic \\textit{i.e.}",
      "Increasing Mn concentration leads to higher columns densities while diameters remain nearly unchanged. For higher growth temperatures, the nanocolumns mean diameter increases and their size distribution widens. Moreover the 4 independent magnetic nanostructures percolate into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Some columns are ferromagnetic even if Curie temperatures remain quite low. In this regime, increasing Mn concentration leads to larger columns while their density remains nearly the same. In parallel, Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters start to form in the film with their $c$-axis perpendicular to the film plane. In both temperature regimes, the Mn incorporation mechanism in the nanocolumns and/or in the matrix changes above 5 \\% of Mn and nanocolumns exhibit an isotropic magnetic behaviour due to the competing effects of out-of-plane shape anisotropy and in-plane magnetoelastic coupling. Finally for a narrow range of growth temperatures around 130$^{\\circ}$C, nanocolumns exhibit Curie temperatures higher than 400 K. Our goal is now to investigate the crystalline structure inside the nanocolumns, in particular the position of Mn atoms in the distorted diamond structure, which is essential to understand magnetic and future transport properties in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.\n\n\\section{Aknowledgements}\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. F. Rieutord for grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements performed on the GMT station of BM32 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.",
      "In particular Mn incorporation is highly inhomogeneous. For very low growth temperatures (below 120$^\\circ$C) the diffusion of Mn atoms leads to the formation of Mn rich, vertical nanocolumns. Their density mostly depends on Mn concentration and their mean diameter is about 2 nm. These results can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Fukushima \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Fuku06}: they proposed a model of spinodal decomposition in (Ga,Mn)N and (Zn,Cr)Te based on layer by layer growth conditions and a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms which leads to the formation of nanocolumns. This model may also properly describe the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns in our samples. Layer by layer growth conditions can be deduced from RHEED pattern evolution during growth. For all the samples grown at low temperature, RHEED observations clearly indicate two-dimensional growth. Moreover, Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructures have been grown and observed by TEM (see Fig. 5). Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge (as well as Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$) interfaces are very flat and sharp thus confirming a two-dimensional, layer by layer growth mode. Therefore we can assume that the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns is a consequence of 2D-spinodal decomposition. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\center\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig5.eps}\n    \\caption{Cross section high resolution micrograph of a Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructure. This sample has been grown at 130 $^{\\circ}$C with 6\\% Mn. Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ layers are 15 nm thick and Ge spacers 5 nm thick. We clearly see the sharpness of both Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge and Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ interfaces. Mn segregation leading to the columns formation already takes place in very thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.}\n\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure} For growth temperatures higher than 160$^\\circ$C, cross section TEM and EFTEM observations (not shown here) reveal the coexistence of two Mn-rich phases: nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters embedded in the germanium matrix.",
      "In the ZFC-FC procedure, the sample is first cooled down to 5 K in zero magnetic field and the susceptibility is subsequently recorded at 0.015 Tesla while increasing the temperature up to 400 K (ZFC curve). Then, the susceptibility is recorded under the same magnetic field while decreasing the temperature down to 5 K (FC curve). Three different regimes can be clearly distinguished. \\\\\nFor $T_{g}\\leq$120$^{\\circ}$C, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization remains nearly the same while increasing growth temperature. The overall magnetic signal vanishing above 200 K is attributed to the nanocolumns whereas the increasing signal below 50 K originates from diluted Mn atoms in the surrounding matrix. The Mn concentration dependence of the saturation magnetization is displayed in figure 8. For the lowest Mn concentration (4 \\%), the contribution from diluted Mn atoms is very high and drops sharply for higher Mn concentrations (7 \\%, 9 \\% and 11.3 \\%). Therefore the fraction of Mn atoms in the diluted matrix decreases with Mn concentration probably because Mn atoms are more and more incorporated in the nanocolumns. In parallel, the Curie temperature of nanocolumns increases with the Mn concentration reaching 170 K for 11.3 \\% of Mn. This behavior may be related to different Mn compositions and to the increasing diameter of nanocolumns (from 1.8 nm to 2.8 nm) as discussed in section \\ref{structural}. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig8.eps}\n    \\caption{Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 100$^{\\circ}$C plotted for different Mn concentrations: 4.1 \\%; 7 \\%; 8.9 \\% and 11.3 \\%.}\n\\label{fig8}\n\\end{figure}\n\nZFC-FC measurements show that the nanocolumns are superparamagnetic. The magnetic signal from the diluted Mn atoms in the matrix is too weak to be detected in susceptibility measurements at low temperature. In samples containing 4 \\% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves superimpose down to low temperatures.",
      "We also discuss the magnetic anisotropy of nanocolumns and  \nGe$_3$Mn$_5$ clusters. \\section{Sample growth}\n\nGrowth was performed using solid sources molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) by co-depositing Ge and Mn evaporated from standard Knudsen effusion cells. Deposition rate was low ($\\approx$ 0.2 \\AA.s$^{-1}$). Germanium substrates were epi-ready Ge(001) wafers with a residual n-type doping and resistivity of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 5 $\\Omega.cm$ respectively. After thermal desorption of the surface oxide, a 40 nm thick Ge buffer layer was grown at 250$^{\\circ}$C, resulting in a 2 $\\times$ 1 surface reconstruction as observed by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) (see Fig. 1a). Next, 80 nm thick Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films were subsequently grown  at low substrate temperature (from 80$^{\\circ}$C to 200$^{\\circ}$C). Mn content has been determined by x-ray fluorescence measurements performed on thick samples ($\\approx$ 1 $\\mu m$ thick) and complementary Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) on thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown on silicon. Mn concentrations range from 1 \\% to 11\\% Mn. For Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at substrate temperatures below 180$^{\\circ}$C, after the first monolayer (ML) deposition, the  2 $\\times$ 1 surface reconstruction almost totally disappears. After depositing few MLs, a slightly diffuse 1 $\\times$ 1 streaky RHEED pattern and a very weak 2 $\\times$ 1 reconstruction (Fig. 1b) indicate a predominantly two-dimensional growth. For growth temperatures above 180$^{\\circ}$C additional spots appear in the RHEED pattern during the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ growth (Fig. 1c). These spots may correspond to the formation of very small secondary phase crystallites. The nature of these crystallites will be discussed below. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed using a JEOL 4000EX microscope with an acceleration voltage of 400 kV. Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was done using a JEOL 3010 microscope equipped with a Gatan Image Filter ."

I know paying using the property taxes was bandied about. The argument against it was it would mean some would be paying for water they aren’t using and others could be big water users, but pay a small special assessment on their property taxes. I think the decision that was made to base it on usage was out of fairness. It seems to me if people are using water and not paying their share of the costs it is not fair. The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don’t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous — still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don’t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn’t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California. Eventually necessity will force desalination past the environmentalists, but not yet. pasojim says:\t09/13/2010 at 7:46 am\nWhatisup – On one of your previous post you made the comment you haven’t heard any of the legal suggestions for the water issue, But you obviously have."

      "The relationship between these two transport directions can be explained as follows. On the one hand, based on the analyses above for $\\phi = 0$, we find that for a given strength of strain, a maximum shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis corresponds to a minimum along the $k_x$-one and vice versa when varying the strain direction $\\theta$. On the other hand, as schematized in the top of Fig. 6 below, the change in the transport direction results in the rotation of the first Brillouin zone, i.e., the $k_x$ (resp. $k_y$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ is identical to the $k_y$ (resp. $k_x$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 0$. These two features explain essentially the opposite $\\theta$-dependence of conduction gap for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$, compared to the case of $\\phi = 0$ as mentioned. Again, we found the same qualitative behavior of conduction gap when applying the strains of $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$. Next, we investigate the conduction gap with respect to different transport directions $\\phi$. We display a ($\\theta,\\phi$)-map of conduction gap for $\\sigma = 4 \\%$ in Fig. 6 and, in the top, an additional diagram illustrating the rotation of Dirac points in the $k-$space with the change in the transport direction. It is clearly shown that (i) a similar scale of conduction gap is obtained for all different transport directions, (ii) there is a smooth and continuous shift of $E_{cond.gap}-\\theta$ behavior when varying $\\phi$, and (iii) the same behavior of $E_{cond.gap}$ is also observed when comparing the two transport directions of $\\phi$ and $\\phi+30^\\circ$, similarly to the comparison above between $\\phi = 0^\\circ$ and $30^\\circ$. The data plotted in Fig. 6 additionally shows that $E_{cond.gap}$ takes the same value in both cases of $\\{\\phi,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\phi,-\\theta\\}$ with a remark that the strains of $-\\theta$ and $180^\\circ-\\theta$ are identical. Moreover, the values of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, for which the conduction gap has a peak or is equal to zero, have an almost linear relationship.",
      "In particular, the relationship for conduction gap peaks is approximately given by $\\theta = \\theta_A - \\eta_s \\phi$. For tensile strains, $\\eta_s$ takes the values of $\\sim 1.5667$ and $1.4333$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. On the opposite, it is about $1.4333$ and $1.5667$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively, for compressive strain cases. All these features are consequences of the rotation of Dirac points in the $k$-space with respect to the transport direction $\\phi$ as illustrated in the diagram on the top and the lattice symmetry of graphene. Finally, we investigate other junctions based on compressive and tensile strained graphene sections. The idea is that in this type of strained junction, the shifts of Dirac points are different in two graphene sections of different strains, which offers the possibilities to use smaller strains to achieve a similar conduction gap, compared to the case of unstrained/strained junction. In Fig. 7, we display the maps of conduction gap with respect to the directions of compressive ($\\theta_c$) and tensile ($\\theta_t$) strains in two cases of transport direction $\\phi = 0$ (armchair) and $30^\\circ$ (zigzag) for given strain strengths. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 7(a,b), with smaller strains $\\left\\{ {{\\sigma _c},{\\sigma _t}} \\right\\} = \\left\\{ { - 2\\% ,2\\% } \\right\\}$ or $\\left\\{ { - 1\\% ,3\\% } \\right\\}$, similar conduction gap of about 310 meV can be achieved (see Figs. 7(a,b)) while it requires a strain of 4 $\\%$ in the unstrained/strained junctions discussed above. However, since the shift of Dirac points is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strains and the transport direction, the properties of conduction gap are more complicated than in the latter case. In particular, our calculations show that the preferred transport directions to achieve a large conduction gap are close to the armchair one. Otherwise, the conduction gap is generally smaller, similarly to the data for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ compared to $\\phi = 0$, as shown in Fig.",
      "7. Additionally, it is shown that the preferred directions of applied strains in the case of $\\phi = 0$ are close to ${\\theta _c} \\equiv {\\theta _t} = 0$ or $90^\\circ$.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nBased on the tight binding calculations, we have investigated the effects of uniaxial strain on the transport properties of graphene strained junctions and discuss systematically the possibilities of achieving a large conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction and the transport direction. It has been shown that due to the strain-induced deformation of graphene lattice and hence of graphene bandstructure, a finite conduction gap higher than 500 meV can be achieved for a strain of only 6 $\\%$. Moreover, as a consequence of the shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis, the conduction gap is strongly dependent not only on the strain strength but also on the direction of applied strain and the transport direction. A full picture of these properties of conduction gap has been presented and explained. The study hence could be a good guide for the use of this type of unstrained/strained graphene junction in electronic applications.\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Acknowledgment.}} This research in Hanoi is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.02-1012.42.

Someone should still ask Spaz on Monday since he does know Sandusky and played under Paterno. This is a shot of Kaleb Ramsey talking to the media. And here is all the players together. Cleary also fielded questions, including those about biology and chemistry. I expect more on Monday when Spaz talks.

Is it impacting recruiting? -- What are his expectations for the season? Does he see the team competing for a division title?\n-- What attracted him to Doug Martin's offense?",

We like to blame the tailgating or Spaz or the schedule, but the reality is there are multiple factors. Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats. That would take up more space, eliminate seats and improve the watching experience. The internet has added fluidity to the ticket market. It used to be BC fans would buy season ticket packages to assure themselves Notre Dame tickets or some other desirable game.",
      "Notice anyone missing? It is just a silly Youtbue video but I find it very telling that the school left out the Head Coach. This is college football. Your head coach is the face of the program. Ours isn't even mentioned in a direct marketing message to our most loyal customers. There are many likely explanations for Spaz's absence. He's not particularly good on camera. He's never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. And I think BC has heard enough to know that Spaz is not very popular with our fan base. No reason to trot him out when it will just dampen excitement about the upcoming season. I like Bill McGovern and Doug Martin. Both are capable coordinators and leaders.

Institutions: University of Mons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a type of synaptic plasticity characterized by an increase in synaptic strength and believed to be involved in memory encoding. LTP elicited in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices has been extensively studied. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance phase of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This could be partly due to the various experimental conditions used by different laboratories. Indeed, the maintenance phase of LTP is strongly dependent on external parameters like oxygenation, temperature and humidity. It is also dependent on internal parameters like orientation of the slicing plane and slice viability after dissection. The optimization of all these parameters enables the induction of a very reproducible and very stable long-term potentiation. This methodology offers the possibility to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the stable increase in synaptic strength in hippocampal slices. It also highlights the importance of experimental conditions in in vitro investigation of neurophysiological phenomena.

Mathis, Jennifer L. Furman, Christopher M. Norris. Institutions: University of Kentucky College of Public Health, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine. The rodent hippocampal slice preparation is perhaps the most broadly used tool for investigating mammalian synaptic function and plasticity. The hippocampus can be extracted quickly and easily from rats and mice and slices remain viable for hours in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, basic electrophysisologic techniques are easily applied to the investigation of synaptic function in hippocampal slices and have provided some of the best biomarkers for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity.",
      "Aging and amyloid pathology may also exacerbate hippocampal damage sustained during the dissection procedure, again complicating any inferences drawn from physiologic assessment. Here, we discuss the steps taken during the dissection procedure to minimize these problems. Examples of synaptic responses acquired in \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" slices from rats and mice are provided, as well as representative synaptic plasticity experiments. The possible impact of other methodological factors on synaptic function in these animal models (e.g. recording solution components, stimulation parameters) are also discussed. While the focus of this article is on the use of aged rats and transgenic mice, novices to slice physiology should find enough detail here to get started on their own studies, using a variety of rodent models.

Institutions: North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina Central University, Durham, Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Proximal resistance vessels, such as the mesenteric arteries, contribute substantially to the peripheral resistance. These small vessels of between 100-400 μm in diameter function primarily in directing blood flow to various organs according to the overall requirements of the body. The rat mesenteric artery has a diameter greater than 100 μm. The myography technique, first described by Mulvay and Halpern1, was based on the method proposed by Bevan and Osher2. The technique provides information about small vessels under isometric conditions, where substantial shortening of the muscle preparation is prevented. Since force production and sensitivity of vessels to different agonists is dependent on the extent of stretch, according to active tension-length relation, it is essential to conduct contraction studies under isometric conditions to prevent compliance of the mounting wires.",

Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia.",
      "Unlike most established human glioblastoma cell line xenografts, injection of transformed GEM-derived cortical astrocytes into the brains of immune-competent littermates produced astrocytomas, including the most aggressive subtype, glioblastoma, that recapitulated the histopathological hallmarks of human astrocytomas, including diffuse invasion of normal brain parenchyma. Bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic allografts from transformed astrocytes engineered to express luciferase was utilized to monitor in vivo tumor growth over time. Thus, astrocytoma models using astrocytes and NSC harvested from GEM with conditional oncogenic alleles provide an integrated system to study the genetics and cell biology of astrocytoma pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and may be useful in preclinical drug development for these devastating diseases.

Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University. Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation."

      "Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information. We show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication. In order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues. We interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination. The social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing. The idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios. In real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch.",
      "However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'. INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination. In humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination. Especially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations . However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication.",
      "In this setting, the communication may be bootstrapped, since our optimal critic has examples with strong signals from the 'social shadowing' episodes. Additionally, we show that the minimization of our independence objective enables tokens that contain minimal overlapping information with other tokens. Preventing trivial communication paradigms enables higher performance. Each of these objectives is complementary, so they are not trivially minimized during training, which is a substantial advantage over comparative baselines. Unlike prior work, this enables the benefits of training with reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings. In addition to lower sample complexity, the mutual information regularization yields additional benefits, such as small messages, which enables the compression aspect of sparse communication. From a qualitative point of view, the independent information also yields discrete emergent concepts, which can be further made human-interpretable by a post-hoc analysis . This is a step towards white-box machine learning in multi-agent settings. The interpretability of this learned white-box method could be useful in human-agent teaming as indicated by prior work . The work here will enable further results in decision-making from high-dimensional data with emergent concepts. The social scenarios described are a step towards enabling a zero-shot communication policy. This work will serve as future inspiration for using emergent communication to enable ad-hoc teaming with both agents and humans. Appendix\n\nA.1. Proofs Proposition 4.1 For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: Proof. Starting with the independent information objective, we want to minimize the interaction information, which defines the conditional mutual information between each token and, Let π i m (m l |h) be a variational approximation of p(m l |h), which is defined by our message encoder network. Given that each token should provide unique information, we assume independence between m l .",
      "Social Shadowing\n\nCritics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory. The agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination. This tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions. Discussion\n\nBy using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication. The emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents."

      "For example, the stream of content is derived from friends in a social network such as the social network application 109 or people that the user frequently emails. The more important that the person appears to be to the user, the more likely that the user will be interested in the candidate content item. Thus, in one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 applies a weight to candidate content items based on the social relationship of the user to the friend. For example, users that are friends receive higher weights than candidate content items from second generation friends of the user (i.e., a friend of a friend). In one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 receives information about relationships between users from the social graph 179. The collaborative filtering engine 217 increases the weights applied to candidate content items from friends when the user positively responds to the items. For example, if the user comments on the item or indicates that the user found the item interesting, the collaborative filtering engine 217 increase the weight so that more candidate content items from the friend become part of the stream of content. The user interface engine 260 is software including routines for generating a user interface that, when rendered on a browser, displays a channel generated for a user and enables the user to customize the channel. In one embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating a user interface. In another embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the channel engine 240 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 232. The user interface engine 260 receives instructions from the channel engine 240 for generating a display.",
      "Furthermore, because in one embodiment the breaking news channel is personalized since the content items are compared to a model for the user, the breaking news channel is more relevant than simply a list of popular or recent news items. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to another user's channel (a friend, a famous person, etc.) that is public. Subscribing to another user's channel is advantageous because, for example, a user who is interested in the stock market will benefit by viewing the stream of content that is viewed by a famous stock market analyst. In yet another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables the user to search for channels that are public using the search engine 143. The subscription module 376, suggests such channels that are viewed by other users based on the interests of the user. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 communicates with the collaborative filtering engine 217 to suggest channels viewed by other users with whom the user has a relationship. The channel generator 378 submits a request for a stream of content for a channel to the scoring engine 211. The request includes the channel category identified by the category identifier 374 and channel attributes. The channel attributes include any attribute known to a person with ordinary skill in the art such as a source, presence of keywords, absence of keywords, a media type, a location, a time, a size of a content item, a date, etc. In one embodiment, the channel category and the channel attributes are defined by the user. In another embodiment, channel generator 378 defines the channel attributes for the channel category based on the user's preferences and activities. For example, if a user always reads news articles and seldom watches news videos, the channel generator 378 would define the media type for the channel as text based articles. At any point in time, the user can customize both the channel category and the channel attributes.",
      "In one embodiment, only the candidate content items that exceed a certain threshold are included in the stream of content for the channel. Turning now to the user interface engine 260, FIG. 4 is a graphic representation 400 of a user interface generated by the user interface engine 260 for displaying the stream of content of a channel. In this example, the user interface 400 also includes channels 405 that are pre-defined, channels 410 that are suggested for the user and channels 415 that are subscribed to by the user. The user can also define new channels and attributes by clicking the link 420. The example includes the stream of content for the user's soccer channel 425. The stream of content includes news items 445, videos 450 and social network news feeds 455 from the content sources 440 defined by the user. The candidate content items are listed in decreasing order of their scores. The user interface engine 260 lists five candidate content items with the highest scores in the hot items section 430. The remaining candidate content items are listed in the other items section 435. In another embodiment, the entire stream of content is listed in a single section. FIG. 5 is a graphic representation 500 of a user interface that is generated by the user interface engine 260 for a user to define a new channel or customize an existing channel. In this example, the user interface includes all the channel categories 505 that have been either pre-defined, suggested to the user, or subscribed by the user, and the content sources 510 for each channel category. The user customizes a channel by adding or removing content sources for the channel. In one embodiment, the user edits more advanced channel attributes such as media type, size of the content items, etc. by clicking on the link 515. The user makes the channel public, private or restricts it to a group of people by clicking on link 520. Additionally, the user can also define a new channel by adding a new channel category. Referring now to FIGS. 6-7, various embodiments of the method of the specification will be described.",
      "Inferred information takes into account a user's activities. The model generation engine 207 will infer that a user is interested in a particular subject, for example, if the subject matter appears in search terms. For example, the model generation engine 207 infers that a user who searches for information about different types of butterflies is interested in butterflies. The model generation engine 207 can even infer information based on the user's friends' activities. For example, content items that interest the user's friends might also interest the user. As a result, in one embodiment, the model includes the user's friends' interests. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 also generates a model that contains several pieces of global meta-information about the user's consumption patterns including how frequently the user consumes the stream of content of a channel and global statistics on how likely the user is to reshare various types of items. Lastly, the model includes a sequence of weights and multipliers that are used to make predictions about the user's likelihood of clicking on, sharing or otherwise engaging with stream items. The model generation engine 207 generates the model from the user information across the heterogeneous data sources. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 builds extensions to the model that employ the patterns of behavior of other users. For example, the model predicts the user's behavior based on the reaction of similar users. All the data that is derived from other users is anonymized before it is incorporated into the model. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 generates a model based on user information, for example, based on the user's search history or third-party accounts. Alternatively, the model generation engine 207 receives periodic updates (one hour, one day, one week, etc.) from the heterogeneous data sources and in turn updates the model. In yet another embodiment, the model generation engine 207 generates a model each time it receives a request for generating a stream of content for a channel.",
      "In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 receives the request from the channel engine 240 and queries the new content items stored in memory 237. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 directly queries the heterogeneous data sources. The scoring engine 211 receives candidate content items that include the channel category and the channel attributes. The scoring engine 211 then compares the candidate content items to the model to determine whether the user would find the candidate content items interesting. In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 first performs the query and then compares the results to the model to determine whether the user would find them interesting. In another embodiment, these steps are performed simultaneously. In yet another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 compares candidate content items to the model and then filters the results according to the subject matter of the queries. The scoring engine 211 is explained in greater detail below with regard to FIG. 3B.\nThe collaborative filtering engine 217 is software including routines for generating additional candidate content items for the channel through collaborative filtering and transmitting the additional candidate content items to the scoring engine 211 that were derived from collaborative filtering. In one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating additional candidate content items for the channel. In another embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the scoring engine 211 and other components of the computing device via signal line 226.

      "Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping provided specific hardware and methodological criteria are followed. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices and stable micromanipulation allowing independent attainment of pre- and postsynaptic whole cell recordings. While CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell pairs are most widely used in the organotypic slice hippocampal preparation, this technique has also been successful in CA3-CA1 pairs and can be adapted to any neurons that are synaptically connected in the same slice preparation.

Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles. Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia.",

Institutions: University of Mons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a type of synaptic plasticity characterized by an increase in synaptic strength and believed to be involved in memory encoding. LTP elicited in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices has been extensively studied. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance phase of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This could be partly due to the various experimental conditions used by different laboratories. Indeed, the maintenance phase of LTP is strongly dependent on external parameters like oxygenation, temperature and humidity. It is also dependent on internal parameters like orientation of the slicing plane and slice viability after dissection. The optimization of all these parameters enables the induction of a very reproducible and very stable long-term potentiation. This methodology offers the possibility to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the stable increase in synaptic strength in hippocampal slices. It also highlights the importance of experimental conditions in in vitro investigation of neurophysiological phenomena.

Mathis, Jennifer L. Furman, Christopher M. Norris. Institutions: University of Kentucky College of Public Health, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine. The rodent hippocampal slice preparation is perhaps the most broadly used tool for investigating mammalian synaptic function and plasticity. The hippocampus can be extracted quickly and easily from rats and mice and slices remain viable for hours in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, basic electrophysisologic techniques are easily applied to the investigation of synaptic function in hippocampal slices and have provided some of the best biomarkers for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity."

      "At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third. He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK). English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.",
      "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash. In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. Opposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017.",
      "Strong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax. Allowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election. Prime Minister (2016–2017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016. English appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same. In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae."

      "The production of an archaeobotanical dataset is very time-consuming, and interim publication on notable aspects of an assemblage may be considered as a necessary publication strategy. More broadly, one important aspect is issues of equity in access to digital archiving resources (Wright & Richards 2018), such as differential access to funds, training and knowledge. A recent study in Sweden found that we need to know concerns, needs, and wishes of archaeologists in order to improve preservation of archaeological data (Huvila 2016), especially when control of ones data may be linked to perceptions of job security. In order to make improvements in data sharing and reuse across archaeology, we need improved training in data sharing and the reuse of data in higher education (Touchon & McCoy 2016; Cook et al. 2018), improved training in data management (Faniel et al. 2018), and crucially, the necessary software skills to make the reuse of archived datasets attainable (Kansa & Kansa 2014: 91). Examples of good practice in archaeobotany are the Vaihingen and Gordion datasets which demonstrate how datasets can be archived in data repositories to accompany a monograph (Bogaard 2011b; Marston 2017b), whilst Farahani (2018) provides an excellent example of a journal article, where the primary data is supplied as a .csv in a cited data repository along with the R script for the analysis. In tandem with the need to encourage authors to share their data, is the need for journals to create and implement research data policies. Given the existence of research data policies in many of the journals included here, this reflects other findings of the poor enforcement of data policies by journals (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018), supporting arguments that journals should not be relied upon to make data accessible, and data should instead by deposited in digital repositries. In order to implement change in data sharing, there is a role to play for learned societies and academic organisation in lobbying funding bodies, prioritising data sharing in research projects.",
      "A closely related issue is that of data reuse. Responsible reuse of primary data encourages the sharing of primary data (Atici et al. 2013), but levels of data reuse in archaeology are thought to remain low (Huggett 2018). Principles for responsible data citation in archaeology have recently been developed summarising how datasets should be cited (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). In order to assess the current status of data sharing, citation and data re-use in archaeobotany, a review was undertaken of the publication of primary data and the publication of meta-analysis in major archaeological journals over the last ten years, building on recent pilot studies within archaeology (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). The review of academic journals provided a contrast to recent assessments of archaeobotanical data deriving from developer-funded archaeology (Lodwick 2017c; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). Journal articles have been selected as the focus of this study as the provision of online supplementary materials in the majority of journals and the ability to insert hyperlinks to persistent identifiers (eg a DOI) to link to datasets available elsewhere should not limit the publication of data and references. Much archaeobotanical data is also published elsewhere, especially from projects not based in the university sector, that is commercial or community archaeology in the UK. Archaeobotanical datasets emanating from this research are more commonly published through monographs, county journal articles, and unpublished (or grey literature) reports, but these are beyond the scope of the current review. All journal articles were included which represent the principle reporting of a new archaeobotanical assemblage. The selected journals fall within three groups. First, what is considered the specialist archaeobotanical journal (Vegetation History and Archaeobotany (VHA)). Second, archaeological science journals (Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, Environmental Archaeology, The Holocene, Journal of Archaeological Science (JAS), Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports (JASR), Journal of Ethnobiology, Quaternary International, Journal of Wetland Archaeology), which can be considered as specialist sub-disciplinary journals which should be maintaining data-quality.",
      "However, elsewhere, journals with no research data policy, such as Antiquity, has one of the lower levels of data sharing (Figure 1). Chart showing the location of primary archaeobotanical data in Vegetation History and Archaeobotany. There are various reasons for why a primary dataset may be lacking. The option of providing supplementary datasets has been available in many of the journals here since before the start of the surveyed period (e.g. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany in 2004), and so cannot be a reason for the absence of data publication in this journal while it may be a reason in other journals. Reasons suggested for a lack of data sharing within archaeology include technological limitations, and resistance amongst some archaeologists to making their data available due to cautions of exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities of analysis before others use it and loss of ‘capital’ of data (Moore & Richards 2015: 34–35). Furthermore, control over how data tables is presented (taxa ordering, summary data presented) may also contribute to the preferential publishing of data within journal articles. Another factor to consider is the emphasis on the creation of new data through archaeological research (Huvila 2016). The creation of a new archaeobotanical dataset through primary analysis is a key form of training in archaeobotany, and the perception of the value of the reuse of other previously published archaeobotanical journals may be low, hence not encouraging the sharing of well-documented datasets. Excellent exams of data reuse have resulted in influential studies (Bogaard 2004; Riehl 2008; Wallace et al. 2019), and would hopefully encourage further data sharing in the future. Given that there are numerous examples of meta-analysis which do take place in archaeobotany, it seems likely that the prevalent form of data sharing is through informal data sharing between individual specialists. However, this does not improve access to data in the long term, and is inefficient and time consuming, with large potential for data errors (Kansa & Kansa 2013), and relies on personal networks, which are likely to exclude some researchers.",
      "So-called ‘grey literature’ results from the initial evaluation stage of developer-funded investigations and accompanying post-excavation assessment often contain a semi-quantitative evaluation of archaeobotanical samples on a scale of abundance. Whilst paper reports were initially deposited with county Historic Environment Records, a process of digitisation focussing on the Roman period has meant many pdfs are now available through the ADS (Allen et al. 2018), whilst born-digital reports are now deposited through OASIS (Online AccesS to the Index of archaeological investigationS), as part of the reporting process (Evans 2015), althought the extent to which specialist appendices are included is variable. These varying ‘publication’ strategies means archaeobotanical data is often available somewhere for recent developer-funded excavations and large-scale developer-funded excavations, even if much of this data is as a printed table or .pdf file (Evans 2015; Evans and Moore 2014). However, academic journals are typically perceived as the most high-status publication venue for archaeobotanical data, and a crucial publication venue for academics in order to comply with institutional requirements and the norms of career progression. Aside from the problem of access to pay-walled journals by those without institutional subscriptions to all journals, the publication of primary data alongside research articles faces various problems, from the outright lack of inclusion of data, to problematic curation of supplementary data and a lack of peer review of data (Costello et al. 2013; Warinner and d’Alpoim Guedes 2014: 155; Whitlock, 2011). The extent of these problems for archaeobotany is currently unknown. Given the growth in archaeobotanical data production as methodologies are introduced into many new regions and periods over the last decade, it is vital that we know whether the mass of new data being produced is made available and is being reused. Recent important advances within archaeobotanical data sharing have focussed on the construction of the ARBODAT database, developed by Angela Kreuz at the Kommission für Archäologische Landesforschung in Hessen.",
      "The reuse of archaeobotanical data also extends to include datasets used as “controls” in commonly used forms of statistical analysis, for instance Jones’s weed data from Amorgos, Greece, which is utilised as a control group in discriminant analysis of crop-processing stage (Jones 1984), and ethnographic observations of crop items in different crop-processing stages (Jones 1990). 2.3. Open data principles and solutions\nDebates over issues of data publication and meta-analysis have been on-going across scientific disciplines over the last decade (Editors 2009), and have been summarised within principles of open science, as recently set out in relation to archaeology (Marwick et al. 2017). Open Data is one of the three core principles for promoting transparency in social science (Miguel et al. 2014). The FAIR principles, developed by representatives from academia, industry, funding agencies, industry and publishers, provide four principles which data sharing should meet for use by both humans and machines – Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (Wilkinson et al. 2016). A recent report assessing the adoption and impact of FAIR principles across academia in the UK included archaeology as a case study (Allen and Hartland 2018: 46). It reported how the ADS was often used to archive data, but that “The journal itself provides the “story” about the data, the layer that describes what the data is, how it was collected and what the author thinks it means.” The report also raises the problem that smaller projects may not have the funding to utilise the ADS, meaning that other repositories are utilised. Increasingly, archaeological data is made available through a wide range of data repositories (OSF, Mendeley Data, Zenodo, Open Context), university data repositories (e.g. ORA-Data), or social networking sites for academics (Academia.edu, ResearchGate). More widely in archaeology, some have observed that archaeological data is rarely published (Kintigh et al. 2014), and recent reviews have reported low levels of data sharing (Huggett 2018; Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018)."

Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University. Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation.",

Institutions: VECT-HORUS SAS, CNRS, NICN UMR 7259.The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. Our aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. Astrocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection following trypsin digestion and were frozen for later co-culture. RBEC were isolated from 5-week-old rat cortices. The brains were cleaned of meninges and white matter, and mechanically dissociated following enzymatic digestion. Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders.

Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop. There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars.",
      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts."

      "Alternatively, I’d be happy to write a short blurb or paragraph or two (or a longer piece - just let me know) highlighting the key points because I think some of your readers might get a lot of value from it. My son just turned 15 and is a freshman in high school. Although this is his first year in a general ed environment, he is struggling with behaviors in school. He has meltdowns and does not express why he would have them until much later. Once we all know what caused it, the school will accommodate him and try to \"change up\" things so as not to cause his meltdown. Once that is resolved, another issue comes up and causes him to melt down. He is a high functioning and academically does well, when he wants to do the work. We battle at home over homework. He does not care how it is done, as long as he hands it in. He thinks failing a test is ok, at least he took the test. Homework is never on his mind when he gets home from school. If I never prompt him, he would never open is backpack. He can be aggressive but is never intentionally trying to hurt anyone. He may push over a chair in school, but it is not directed at anyone. We know how that in itself could hurt someone who gets hit by it though. He is defiant in that he only wants to do what interests him. He does not go out by himself (still immature), or abuse alcohol or drugs and never curses. He is a very funny kid and very talented. His main problems are task avoidance and seeking attention. He can be disrespectful to adults in that he is \"cheeky\" with them, trying to be funny or cute. And he has no \"filters\". I’ve just finished reading your Living with an Aspergers Partner ebook. I found it so informative, thank you. You offered some personal advise, and i wanted to run a situation past you and seek your input as to a strategy for what to do next. I’ve been seeing a guy for about 7 months now who I believe has Aspergers. I came to this conclusion months ago and I don’t think he realizes, (or acknowledges) although he is aware he has some traits.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations.",
      "Leading up to this I had been battling anxiety and depression which my husband found very hard to cope with. Over the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage. Please Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future. Thank you for listening and your site. I have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate. I did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she’s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn’t want to come home (the next day after school). By this stage, I also had enough and didn’t go get her. I thought I am not begging. You will run out of money soon. It was quite a relief to have some peace. Daughter’s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it). I didn’t really want this but made a compromise that daughter would go there Tues morning – Friday afternoon as the friend is an A student whereas my daughter is failing. They do the same subjects. I made the decision at the end of the day based on what is good for me – some time away from the daughter.",
      "We worked with him on making eye contact when talking with others. We explained different emotions in people's faces and mannerisms to help him know how to interact with others. We discussed the fact that people would say things that did not mean what they souneded like - such as \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\". As we did these things he worked hard to better understand communication with others. During his 4th grade year I had a teacher from the gifted program ask me if I had ever heard of Aspergers. I told her that I had not heard of it. She proceeded to read me some of the charateristics and so many of them described my son. So we had him tested by the school district during the summer between 4th and 5th grade and they did find that he had Aspergers but that he was high functioning. We then set him up with and EIP which stayed with him until his sophomore year. We pulled him from it at that time because we had moved and the new district was requiring him to take one class a day that was a study class. This reduced the number of required classes he could take and he was doing fine with his studies at the time. It was during the 2nd half of his Junior year that we noticed some of his grades going down. Then during his Senior year is when he started skipping classes and not doing assignments. We had not realized it before then but we soon became aware that he was addicted to gaming. He would go to the library or somewhere else on campus and play games on the computer rather than go to class. It was also at this time that he began lying about his actions (so as not to get in trouble). Based on his grades and his ACT score he received offers from colleges for full tuition scholarships. He chose the college where he had taken concurrent classes during his high school years. But he proceeded to skip class and not turn in assignments so he lost his scholarship and quit attending college. During this time he was only able to find employment through an employment agency where he was mostly sent to manuel labor type jobs (which is not something he enjoys but he did it anyway).",
      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling."

      "In the inpainting tasks, the existence of a mask is essential as the algorithm needs to know where to fill in the missing area, whereas, in our work, we wanted to know whether the network can perform completion on its own without the need for the mask. In other words, is it possible for the network to predict where to fill in at the same time that it is trying to reconstruct the incomplete image through the iterative process? To answer this question, we tried to solve a much harder problem in which the mask is not provided to the model and the model is agnostic to it. To better understand how a solution could be hypothesized for this problem, we first imagine that we want to consider all the available regions in our image that could be potential places to fill in, i.e., we set the mask in the previous formula 1 to be equal to the incomplete image x I . This is problematic as the model quickly tries to fill in all white space and quickly reconstructs the incomplete image by doing so. On the other hand, we can take the inverse problem of the current problem, where the model tries to just fill in the regions that fragmented contour lives in. Taking these two at the same time, we came up with a novel loss term for energy minimization term that helps us remove the need for the mask in the case of the contour completion problem:\nIn this term, we introduce a linear combination of the two loss terms, where one focuses on reconstructing the missing regions in the foreground, and one focuses on avoiding inpainting regions in the background. The logic behind this is that, if we assume the original image to be representative of the mask, then the model tries to reconstruct in all white regions (the foreground), and in the inverse problem we just want to reconstruct the regions that are already part of the ground truth. Stopping Criteria\n\nAs shown in Figure , knowing when to stop iterating to the over-fitted model is a key to obtaining a completed shape. Therefore, we equipped our model with a criterion that uses two individual novel terms to know when to stop and output the result of the network.",
      "To be able to address this problem, we first look at a similar problem in image editing, known as image inpainting. Image inpainting is the task of completing an image where some regions of that image are covered or filtered by a mask. In image inpainting, the generative model receives a masked image with the mask that guides the algorithm to fill in those missing regions. Although in the problem of contour completion, we have a very similar goal, the additional challenge that we suffer from is that we do not necessarily have a mask that covers the regions of interest for us. For example, when we look at Figure (left), we are not provided that which regions of the image are incomplete by a guiding mask. Our brain figures this out just by looking at the form and predicting those missing regions. Inspired by the image inpainting work of DIP , we propose a novel algorithm for the contour completion problem (see Figure ), where, unlike DIP, we do not have a guiding mask to know where to fill in the missing regions of our disconnected contours. Let us assume that we are given a degraded image x I containing a fragmented contour. We propose an iterative process (see Figure ) that can connect those discontinuities and glue those fragmented pieces together as follows. We propose an hour-glass model structure (f ) that is initially set up with completely random parameters (θ 0 ) at first. Through an iterative process, we start feeding our network with a fixed random tensor noise z signal and obtain the inferred output (f (z)) from that network. We then back-propagate the difference between the inferred output and the incomplete image to the network. We then repeat this process until the difference between the generated outcome of the network (f θ (z)) and the incomplete image (x I ) gets smaller and smaller and finally overfits the incomplete image (x I ). In this work, we propose a novel error metric to backpropagate in the model and update its weights. we set the metric in a way that enables us to complete the incomplete image before it overfits the incomplete image.",
      "The numbers in this table are showing the percentage of the time that DIP was successful to complete shapes with each gap size and corresponding receptive field size. As predicted, the bigger the filter size, the more successful the algorithm is in filling in the gaps. abstract\n\nHumans can easily perceive illusory contours and complete missing forms in fragmented shapes. This work investigates whether such capability can arise in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using deep structural priors computed directly from images. In this work, we present a framework that completes disconnected contours and connects fragmented lines and curves. In our framework, we propose a model that does not even need to know which regions of the contour are eliminated. We introduce an iterative process that completes an incomplete image and we propose novel measures that guide this to find regions it needs to complete. Our model trains on a single image and fills in the contours with no additional training data. Our work builds a robust framework to achieve contour completion using deep structural priors and extensively investigate how such a model could be implemented. Introduction\n\nThe human visual system is used to seeing incomplete outlines. Our brains can effortlessly group visual elements and fragmented contours that seem to be connected to each other. This power enables us to make shapes, organize disconnected visual features, and even properties of 3D surfaces when projected on 2D planes.\ndemonstrated how early vision may quickly complete partially-occluded objects using monocular signals. This capability of perceptual grouping has been studied in vision science for decades . Although there has been some work on perceptual grouping in the past couple of years, it has been less studied in the past decade due to the enormous progress of deep neural networks and their success in dealing with the pixel-by-pixel inference of images. Different types of lines and curves have been studied to maximize the connectivity of two broken ends in the planer",
      "In training, we use the MSE loss between the degraded image and the output of the network, and we optimize the loss using the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate equal to 0.01 . In our experiments, we also used α = 0.15 as an optimal proportion coefficient for reconstruction loss. Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we introduced a novel framework for contour completion using deep structure priors (DSP). This work offers a novel notion of a maskless grouping of fragmented contours. In our proposed framework, we introduced a novel loss metric that does not require a strict definition of the mask. Instead, it lets the model learn the perceivable illusory contours and connects those fragmented pieces using a generator network that is solely trained on just the single incomplete input image. Our model does not require any pre-training which demonstrates that the convolutional architecture of the hour-glass model is able to connect disconnected contours. We present an extended set of experiments that show the capability of our algorithm. We investigate the effect of each parameter introduced in our algorithm separately and show how one could possibly achieve the best result for their problem using this model. In future work, we plan to extend this model and try to see how it performs with real images. In particular, we want to determine whether we can inpaint real-world photographs while retaining perceptually aware scene structures. The importance of shape in perception by deep neural networks has been highlighted in many adversarial examples to appearance-based networks . The outcome of this work has strong potential to impact the designing and implementation of models that are robust to such perturbations."

      "The qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ]. Thus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold. These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously. Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions. The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red). In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food.",
      "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume. To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value. While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ).

      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.",
      "If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small. Therefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ. This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. . Indeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues. A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ). This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment."

The epistemic cut, the subject/object cut, the mind/matter cut, all are rooted to that original cut at the origin of life.

For some a, c ∈ Z and a < c, we will write For some e, g ∈ R and e < g, we will write\n\nRoad Model\n\nThe physical road structure is modeled as a continuous multi-lane highway with negligible curvature and unidirectional traffic flow. The lanes on the highway are clearly demarcated and at any given time k, the number of available lanes for the vehicles to travel on is denoted by N l (k) while the road speed limit is denoted by V l . Therefore, the set of lanes available for traveling at a given time instant k is denoted by . We work with the Frenet coordinate system where the distance along the road is denoted by the longitudinal displacement (s) and the distance perpendicular to the road is defined by the lateral displacement (d). Each lane is assigned a lane indicator variable l. The leftmost lane, with respect to the direction of traffic flow, is assigned a value of l = 0 while each subsequent lane is assigned an increasing integer value for l, as depicted in Fig. . Vehicle Model\n\nSince we aim to have real-time computations for a long planning horizon (> 15s), we model the vehicle dynamics with a linearized decoupled dynamical system. For the highway driving scenario, where the road curvature is typically small, it is reasonable to assume a decoupling between the lateral and the longitudinal dynamics , especially for the behavior planning layer. Therefore, we utilize a linear constant acceleration model for the longitudinal dynamics and abstract out the lateral dynamics with a lane indicator variable. For the lane change dynamics, we use a moving average filter coupled with a rounding function to model the time required by the ego vehicle to change lanes. This is compactly represented as: where s 0 (k), v 0 (k), l 0 (k) and L(k) denote the ego vehicle's longitudinal displacement, speed, lane indicator and target lane, respectively, at time instant k; the subscript i indexes the vehicles on the road with 0 being reserved for the ego vehicle; T s denotes the discretization time step; and N corresponds to the number of time steps required to change lane.",
      "The scalarization parameters γ 1 , γ 2 and γ 3 in the objective function account for a relative tradeoff between maximizing speed, minimizing lane changes and minimizing abrupt changes in speed respectively. Increasing γ 1 yields a more aggressive behavior with the priority placed on maximizing speed while γ 2 and γ 3 combine to place an emphasis on maximizing passenger comfort by reducing lane and speed changes respectively. Dynamical Constraints: These constraints are put in place to ensure the dynamical feasibility of the solution. The constraints ( ), and serve to initialize the longitudinal displacement, speed and target lane respectively for the optimizer, based on the values observed at time instant k. The constraints and ( ) bound the ego vehicle's speed by the speed limit and the acceleration limits of the vehicle respectively. The ego vehicle's speed is then used to calculate the projected longitudinal displacement in . The target lane values at any planning step (j) are restricted to the set of reachable values by ( ), ( ) and . Here, restricts the target lane to the set of available lanes (L(k)), ensures that the lane change, if needed, is made to the adjacent lane only and (17) models the time steps (N ) required for a lane change. The flooring function can easily be transformed into a couple of linear constraints by the introduction of an auxiliary integer variable, as shown in the Appendix. Finally, l k (j) is merely the internal representation of the lane the ego vehicle is projected to travel on at planning step j. Safety Constraint: The safety constraint ensures that the ego vehicle maintains a minimum safe distance (L s i (j)) to the nearest vehicle i, in its projected lane of travel (l k (j)), at planning instant j.\nWe borrow the definition of this safe distance from , where the authors provide a formalization, based on the clause from Vienna Convention on Road Traffic that states that \"A vehicle [...] shall keep at a sufficient distance [...] to avoid collision if the vehicle in front should suddenly slow down or stop.",
      "Experimental Setup\n\nThe implementation setup, depicted in Fig. , is composed of the CARLA simulator (Version 0.9.11) , SLAS module (Section III-B), and the planner and controller module . To solve the optimization problem for SLAS, we use Gurobi Optimizer (Version 9.1.1) . The simulations are performed on a computer equipped with an Intel Xeon(R) CPU E5-2643 v4 @ 3.40GHz × 12 and NVIDIA Titan XP, running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. On average, the time required for each optimization step is ∼ 0.096s, while the maximum time limit for the optimizer is set to 0.2s, indicating the strong potential for real-time applicability. Case Study\n\nFigure illustrates the test case scenario for our comparative analysis. The scenario is composed of a highway segment with four lanes and the rightmost lane reserved for merging vehicles. The ego vehicle is initialized to follow a slow moving vehicle in lane 1 and has even slower moving traffic to its right in lane 2. Thus, the only option for it, in order to minimize travel time, is to switch left to lane 0 with faster moving traffic and greater headway. Once it moves to lane 0, and overtakes the slow moving vehicle in lane 1, it has two options: either to keep traveling in lane 0 without making any lane change decisions until getting close to the lead vehicle or proactively exploiting the gap in lane 2 to switch to lane 3 in anticipation of traffic buildup in lanes 1 and 2. A strategic decision maker with foresight will choose to take the later option and make the decision proactively for a greater overall benefit. The evaluation metrics for the comparative analysis include: travel time, lateral displacement, headway and distance to the closest vehicle. As for the simulation parameters, the simulation step size is set to 0.05s (simulation frequency of 20Hz); the velocities of vehicles in lanes 0, 1 and 2 are set to 8, 5 and 2 m/s respectively while the speed limit V l is set to 15m/s; the length of the highway patch is set to 350m while the width between the lanes is set to 3.5m; and the sensor visibility range is set to R v = 50m.\nThe parameters for SLAS are set as follows: T s = 0.4s, H = 40, N = 3, A min = −5m/s 2 , A max = 3.5m/s 2 , γ 1 = 1, γ 2 = 0.1 and γ 3 = 0.01.",

Specifically, we target a multi-lane highway driving scenario where an autonomous ego vehicle navigates in traffic. We propose a novel receding horizon mixed-integer optimization based method for SLAS with the objective to minimize travel time while accounting for passenger comfort. We further incorporate various modifications in the proposed approach to improve the overall computational efficiency and achieve real-time performance.",
      "The state (x 0 (k)) and control input (u 0 (k)) to the system at time instant k are defined as: where V m denotes the maximum speed of the ego vehicle. Observation Model\n\nFor practical considerations, we restrict the ego vehicle's visibility range to the sensory perception limit, denoted by R v . Then, the set of vehicles in ego vehicle's visibility range at time instant k, represented by O(k), is defined as: where s i (k) corresponds to the longitudinal displacement of the observed vehicle. Remark 1: For the multi-lane highway driving scenario, occlusion does not play a prominent role so we do not account for it in the existing formulation. However, the proposed framework can easily accommodate occlusion and measurement uncertainties since the receding horizon approach bases its decision on the most up-to-date information available at any given time, as demonstrated in . In this section, we describe the prediction model to generate the predicted future trajectories of observed vehicles and present a discussion on the proposed receding horizon optimization-based behavioral planning module. Trajectory Prediction\n\nReliable behavior and trajectory prediction of other traffic participants is crucial for safe maneuvering of autonomous vehicles. The algorithm proposed in Section III-B is able to incorporate any generic prediction module available in the literature as long as it can provide a deterministic predicted future trajectory for a given vehicle. In this work, we formulate a low-complexity prediction model that highlights the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed approach. For an observed vehicle i ∈ O(k), the future speed profile is predicted using a piece-wise linear function while the lane profile is assumed to stay constant for the duration of the prediction horizon. At a given time step k, the estimated acceleration (ā k i ) and the estimated speed (v k i ) parameters are obtained through linear regression with mean-squared error on the past o k i > 1 speed observations."

The mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. In particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. The proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}. Moreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime: For QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}. Our main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening. Moreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.",
      "This does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not \nintroduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot \ndistances much larger than the coherence length, where $\\GS{\\rm X}\\to 0$.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the \nCAR efficiency as $\\mathcal{C} \\equiv \\GS{\\rm X} / \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\\mathcal{C} < 1$\nin the wide range of $\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \\fig{3}. The results are presented in \\fig{C}. Clearly, decreasing $\\mathcal{C}$ from $\\mathcal{C}=1$ causes diminishing of $\\GS{\\rm X}$, and consequently of CAR \nexchange. For a change as small as $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the \nconventional Kondo regime, compare \\fig{C}(a) with \\fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, \nhowever, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused\nby CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \\fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$\nleads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the\nincreased critical $\\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the\nshallowing of the dip. This is visible especially in the inset in \\fig{C}(b). \\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nThe CAR exchange mechanism is present in any system comprising at least\ntwo QDs or magnetic impurities coupled to the same superconducting contact\nin a way allowing for crossed Andreev reflections. In the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry \nwith respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,\nit leads to the two-stage Kondo\nscreening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms. This CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual \nlow-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case. We have also shown that the competition between CAR exchange and RKKY\ninteraction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios.",
      "For reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism. As can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a). Experimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible. While intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet. This CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding. For such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c). Moreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown). However, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes. From numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\ , \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases."

CAD – Coronary Artery Disease: A narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The condition results from a plaque rupture/blood clot or spasm and greatly increases the risk of a heart attack. Cardiac Ablation – A procedure performed by an Electrophysiologist (EP) – a cardiologist with specialized training in treating heart rhythm problems – that typically uses catheters — long, flexible tubes inserted through a vein in the groin and threaded to the heart — to correct structural problems in the heart that cause an arrhythmia. Cardiac ablation works by scarring or destroying the tissue in your heart that triggers an abnormal heart rhythm. Cardiac Arrest – Also known as Sudden Cardiac Arrest: The stopping of the heartbeat, usually because of interference with the electrical signal that regulates each heartbeat (often associated with coronary heart disease). Can lead to Sudden Cardiac Death. Cardiac Catheterization – An invasive procedure in which a catheter is inserted through a blood vessel in the wrist/arm or groin with x-ray guidance. This procedure can help provide information about blood supply through the coronary arteries, blood pressure, blood flow throughout the chambers of the heart, collection of blood samples, and x-rays of the heart’s ventricles or arteries. It’s typically performed in the cath lab during angiography. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) also called bi-ventricular pacemaker: an electronic pacing device that’s surgically implanted in the chest to treat the delay in heart ventricle contractions that occur in some people with heart failure. Cardiac Tamponade – Pressure on the heart that occurs when blood or fluid builds up in the space between the heart muscle (myocardium) and the outer covering sac of the heart (pericardium).

SA – Sinus node: The “natural” pacemaker of the heart. The node is a group of specialized cells in the top of the right atrium which produces the electrical impulses that travel down to eventually reach the ventricular muscle, causing the heart to contract. SB – Sinus Bradycardia: Abnormally slow heartbeat. SBP – Systolic Blood Pressure: The highest blood pressure measured in the arteries. It occurs when the heart contracts with each heartbeat. Example: the first number in 120/80. SCAD – Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: A rare emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in one of the blood vessels in the heart, causing a heart attack, abnormalities in heart rhythm and/or sudden death. SCAD tends to strike young healthy women with few if any cardiac risk factors.

Endothelial dysfunction affects the ability of these cells to help dilate blood vessels, control inflammation or prevent blood clots. The endothelium is associated with most forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, and severe viral infections. Enhanced External Counterpulsation – EECP is an FDA-approved non-invasive, non-drug treatment for angina. It works by promoting the development of collateral coronary arteries. The therapy is widely used in prominent heart clinics such as the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins – especially for patients who are not good candidates for invasive procedures such as bypass surgery, angioplasty or stenting. EP – Electrophysiologist: A cardiologist who has additional training in diagnosing/treating heart rhythm disorders. EPS – Electrophysiology Study: A test that uses cardiac catheterization to study patients who have arrhythmias (abnormal hear rhythm). An electrical current stimulates the heart in an effort to provoke an arrhythmia, which is immediately treated with medications. EPS is used primarily to identify the origin of the arrhythmia and to test the effectiveness of medications used to treat abnormal heart rhythms. EVH – Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting: To create the bypass graft during CABG open heart surgery, a surgeon will remove or “harvest” healthy blood vessels from another part of the body, often from the patient’s leg or arm.

PVC – Premature Ventricular Contraction: An early or extra heartbeat that happens when the heart’s lower chambers (the ventricles) contract too soon, out of sequence with the normal heartbeat. In the absence of any underlying heart disease, PVCs do not generally indicate a problem with electrical stability, and are usually benign. RA – Right Atrium: The right upper chamber of the heart. The right atrium receives de-oxygenated blood from the body through the vena cava and pumps it into the right ventricle which then sends it to the lungs to be oxygenated. Radial Artery: the artery in the wrist where a thin catheter is inserted through the body’s network of arteries in the arm and eventually into the heart during a procedure to implant a stent. Doctors may also call this transradial access, the transradial approach, or transradial angioplasty.

      "To probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain. Here we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]\nIn Fig. we show the results for i = L/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking. There we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right). The eigenvalues λ of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle. The noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit.",
      "Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size. 1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0). The denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1. For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work. As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1. The eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise.",

      "For example, he may not share enough in therapy session and I’m assuming an AS therapist would recognize that is part of the AS and employ strategies to get information from him that helps with treatment. Sometime he tunes out when he is processing something heavy or that he doesn’t want to hear necessarily, or he gets distracted and I’m hoping an As therapist would recognize that and get that he may need repeated something for example, if this is happening. He is currently suffering from depression that appears clinical in nature as well as reoccurring negative thoughts about something specific that has been worrying him about our relationship. Today he told me these reoccurring thoughts happen during all waking hours unless he watches TV, he never gets a break from them and they make him feel like he is going crazy. As his girlfriend, I am extremely concerned that he cannot get relief from these thoughts and that the therapists he is seeing are unable to help him with his problems. Therefore, I am taking initiative to try and help him find better therapy options, because I want to see him someone who can better help him get to the bottom of things and help him with the challenges he is facing. He really needs an advocate that will help him go deep to figure things out and not just assume therapies are working well, without seeing changes or getting supporting feedback from him in that regard. Here are some questions I am trying to ask in advance to find the right people to help us with this. As you may know, insurance for these therapies are not often available. We don’t have a lot of money to go from therapist to therapist to find the right person and are hoping prescreening will help. I recently downloaded your e-book and listened to your talks and your information is by far the most helpful I have been able to find to date. It's very accurately describes my situation as an NT wife married to a very probable AS husband. I think you for taking the time to write this and sharing your insights as well as the experiences of many of your clients.",
      "He’s highly intelligent and successful, a pattern seeker, has a tendency to focus on the project to hand to the total exclusion of all else for as long sit takes (work or home) socially awkward (has learned coping strategies), sensitive to loud noise, high anxiety with control strategies, black and white thinking etc. He’s currently not working and I’ve seen a slow withdrawal over the last 6 weeks, including the need to ‘escape’ and leave a situation at least once. He also has a bipolar ex overseas who has primary custody one daughter where there has been ongoing patterns of drama which has recently increased. Over the past couple of months (since stopping work and drama increase) I’ve gone from being ‘wonderful’ in his eyes to him now being sorry and not having the ‘urge’ to spend close/intimate time with me and offering friendship. Since he shared that with me in a message he’s stonewalled and has retreated to the safety of minimal messages and talks about not knowing what best to say and not being able to find the right words somehow. He’s a good kind man who I feel is struggling. I’m concerned about his anxiety and possibly the risk of depression. I’m fairly resilient and whilst i’m disappointed he doesn’t want to pursue a relationship with me, i’m concerned for him and his well being. One of his very few close friends is also just leaving the country to live overseas. The strategy I’ve used so far is simply to back off and give him space. I’ve asked to take him up on an original offer he made to talk but haven’t pushed it. I also haven’t been aggressive or accusatory in the few messages i’ve sent. Any advise you could give would be greatly appreciated,\nCarli who is 10 years old and has had behavioral issues her whole life.

      "It has really helped me understand the last 32 years of our marriage and get a grasp on how to move forward. One area that is of primary concern to me, that I did not see addressed, is stimming. I believe that is the behavior my husband is showing through constant vocal singing, repetition of words, shouting out, as well as slapping himself in the chest and general nervous activity. It is very loud and disruptive to our household and it is often a relief when he is not at home. I think there may be a level of Tourette's syndrome as well. I did some searches on the Internet and could not find anything that really describes his behavior. Most of what I found was flapping or children's behavior. I understand that it is a release of nervous tension but I am really trying to find some strategies to help him stop this behavior as it is extremely frustrating and builds my resentment in dealing with it daily. A lot of it is embarrassing as well and sounds childish to me. He usually does this when close family members are around and will reign himself in if he is around other people besides us. When we are home it is constant. He also has a lot of anger, mostly at himself, and blows up at unimportant things, it is as if he has a ton of negative energy inside him that need to get out and stimming is one outlet. I will try to build my acceptance of it, but I also would just like him to stop especially the loudest and most annoying portions. Would you have any resources you could point me to?",
      "I have loads of books I have bought, attended psychiatrists for my son and myself, family therapy, occupational therapy, begged and prayed for change but have been dealing with behavioural issues for so long I am definitely exhausted and resentful. I am a mum to a 15 yr old boy with ASD, dyslexia, OCD and ODD. Sorry to focus on the labels but just to give you an idea of what I am dealing with. I also have a 13 yr old son whom finds his brother’s behaviours difficult, embarassing and challenging. My husband whom is not in great health ( he had a cerebral aneurysm clamped two years ago and has two further aneurysms that are inoperable so endures fatigue, headaches and stress). We have however a pet cat that is very social and a calming influence in the home! I was fortunate enough to have loving parents but I lost both my mum and dad in 2008 and 2015. My inlaws are elderly and quite directly say they are too old to help us so it feels we are alone in dealing with the issues we have. I am desperate for change as the household is one of stress and anger and I feel all the control lies in my son Patrick’s hands. I am hopeful your programme can make life better for all of us but I wonder if it is too early to ask you two questions? The first lies with what to do when Patrick goes into my other son Brendan’s room and will either turn on a light when he is sleeping, yell when he is on his phone or create some disturbance. He will not leave the room when asked to do so and the situation always escalates into yelling and Brendan attempting to physically remove him. This happens regularly and always ends badly with doors slamming, my husband being woken and myself in tears feeling the lack of control and also I admit I seem to think “Why me?” which rationally I know is of no help. The second problem is leaving the house for school. Patrick refuses personal hygiene (either morning or night) and any request to even brush his teeth is fraught with swearing and abuse. If I can get him to shower, he will watch the water roll down the drain and turn up the water really high temp (mu husband has had to turn down the thermostat on the hot water service) without so much as getting wet."

      "BNO notes that protest and also that a group of Iraqi MPs are alleging that Iraqiya bought seats in the Cabinet via money exchanged in Jordan. UPI adds, \"Maliki, a Shiite who has a long history of working with Tehran, has named himself acting minister of defense, interior and national security, three most powerful and sensitive posts in the government he is stitching together. Although Maliki appears to be bending over backward to accommodate rivals among Iraq's Shiite majority as well as minority Sunnis and Kurds in his administration in a spirit of reconciliation, he is unlikely to relinquish those ministries that dominate the security sector.\" DPA reports, \"Sheikh Abdel-Mahdi al-Karbalaei, a confident of influential Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said that the new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for and suggested it could prove to be weaker than the previous government.\" Ranj Alaaldin (Guardian) also spots clouds on the horizon:Lasting peace and stability depends on resolving outstanding disputes with the Kurds on oil, revenue-sharing, security and the disputed territories (Kirkuk in particular). The Kurds, rather than exploiting their kingmaker position to take a stronger proportion of ministries in Baghdad (they are taking just one major portfolio – the foreign ministry), are instead banking on guarantees from Maliki to implement their list of 19 demands that includes resolving the above disputes in their favour. They may have been naive, though. With their historical and federalist partners, the Islamic supreme council of Iraq in decline, the Kurds may be isolated in the new government – a government dominated by the nationalistic and centrist characteristics of the INM, the Sadrists and indeed State of Law. Maliki may, therefore, turn out to be unable to grant concessions even if he wanted to and could use Osama Nujayfi, the new ultra-nationalist speaker of parliament and Kurdish foe, to absorb the Kurdish criticism and insulate himself from any attacks.",

Meanwhile Nizar Latif (The National) reports that distrust is a common reaction to the new government in Baghdad and quotes high school teacher Hussein Abed Mohammad stating, \"Promises were made that trustworthy, competent people would be ministers this time around, but it looks as if everything has just been divided out according to sectarian itnerests. No attention has been paid to forming a functioning government, it is just a political settlement of vested interests. I'm sure al Maliki will have the same problems in his next four years as he had in the last four years.\" Days away from the ten months mark, Nouri managed to finally end the stalemate. Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by \"A good year in Iraq.\" First up, meet the new Iraqi Body Count -- an organization that provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it and insist/slur \"Things aren't so bad!\" Sure enough, the editorial board of the Post does just that noting the laughable \"civilian deaths\" count at iCasualities.

We compare $U'=0$ case with experimentally relevant value $U'=U/10$ \\cite{Keller2013Dec}. While for two close adatoms on SC surface RKKY interactions may lead to prominent consequences\n\\cite{Klinovaja}, the conventional ({\\it i.e.} non-CAR) contribution should \nvanish rapidly when the inter-impurity distance $r$ exceeds a few lattice constants \\cite{RKKYrange,SC_RKKY}. Meanwhile, the CAR exchange may remain significant for $r$ of the order\nof coherence length of the SC contact \\cite{Yao}. Therefore, we first neglect the conventional RKKY coupling and analyze its consequences in Sec.~\\ref{sec:RKKY}. The main results are presented in \\fig{G-T}(a), showing the temperature dependence of $G$\nfor different circumstances.",
      "As $\\widetilde{T}_K$ grows for increasing $\\GS{1}$ (or $x$), $T^*$ decreases according to \\eq{Tstar}. Its $\\GS{}$ dependence can be accounted for by small changes in the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in \\eq{Tstar}, \nas long as $x$ is kept constant. To close the discussion of $T^*(x)$ dependence let us point out, that in \\eq{A_J} \nthere appears a correction to \\eq{Jeff} for $x\\neq 0$. However, it is very small due to additional\nfactor $\\GS{}^2/U^2$ in the leading order. Its influence on curves plotted in \\fig{x}(b) is hardly visible. In turn, let us examine the $x$ dependence of the $T=0$ conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$. As can be seen \nin \\fig{x}(a), it monotonically increases with $x$, as it crosses $x=0$ point. In fact, \\eq{Gmin}\ncan be generalized to\n\\beq\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{U^2} ,\n\\label{Gmin2}\n \\end{equation} \nwith $c\\approx 2.25$ (indicated by a dotted line in \\fig{x}(c)). Note that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is proportional to \n$\\GS{1}^2=(x+1)^2 \\GS{}^2$, instead of simply $\\GS{}$, cf. \\eq{Gmin}. The values of $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ obtained\nfrom all analyzed $G(T)$ dependencies for different $x$ have been compiled in \\fig{x}(c). It is evident, that \\eq{Gmin2} is approximately fulfilled for all the considered cases. Finally, it seems noteworthy that the normal-lead coupling asymmetry, \n$\\Gamma_{\\rm L}\\neq \\Gamma_{\\rm R}$, is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor\ndiminishing the conductance $G$ \\cite{KWIWJB-asym}. \\section{The role of CAR efficiency}\n\\label{sec:coef}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance between the normal leads\n\t\t $G$ as a function of coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{}$, for indicated values of RKKY exchange $J$\n\t\t and the efficiency of CAR processes reduced by factor (a) $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$ and (b) $\\mathcal{C}=0.5$.\n\t\t Other parameters as in \\fig{3}.

      "For reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism. As can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a). Experimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible. While intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet. This CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding. For such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c). Moreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown). However, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes. From numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\ , \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases.",

Remarkably, clear QD states are generated for all three configurations, underlining the potential of N ad-atoms to confine carriers in semiconducting SWNTs and thus to generate intrananotube QDs. \\\\\n\\indent In order to demonstrate the scattering strengths of the different defects, we calculated the energy dependent conductance in addition to the LDOS for the different combinations of the QD defining scattering defects on the $(16,0)$ and $(17,0)$ SWNTs, see supplementary information. Generally we can observe strong conductance modulation of the order of 30-40\\% with regard to the pristine CNT for all three tested defects (double vacancies DV, single vacancies SV and chemisorbed C-N) with the DVs having the largest scattering strength in the CB and VB.  \n\\\\\n\\indent Note that the choice of the zigzag SWNT chiralities in the two different ab-initio scenarios is motivated by the different effective masses of both chiralities ($m^{*}_{(17,0)}>m^{*}_{(16,0)}$) which is typical for chirality families $(3n-1,0)$ and $(3n-2,0)$~\\cite{ZZ_families}. Taking advantage of recent reports on SWNT chirality control~\\cite{chirality_control_EMPA,chirality_control_chinese,chirality_chemistry}, this property could be used in practice to design QDs with different level spacings for the same QD length. From an application point of view, however, QDs generated by DVs will have far superior stability at room temperature due to their high migration barrier above 5 eV ($\\sim$~1 eV for single vacancy)~\\cite{Kra06vm}. This value drops down by at least 2 eV for N ad-atoms depending on their chemisorption configuration~\\cite{Nitrogen_prb_07,Yma05nitr}. \\\\\n\\indent Our ab-initio simulations do not take into account any substrate effect. In the experimental case, the carriers can decay through the substrate, thus limiting their lifetime.",
      "We estimated the level spacings in the conduction band of QD I to 98 meV (m1-m2) and 116 meV (m2-m3). For QD II, we measured 122 meV (m1-m2), 185 meV (m2-m3) and 210 meV (m3-m4). \\\\\n\\indent In the valence band of SWNT I, discrete states with level spacings of the order of 80-90 meV, with one clear maximum at the level m-1, can also be distinguished between defect sites $d3'-d4$ in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(b). The discretization of the states indicates that this QD structure also confines holes. Discrete states starting from m-2 and lower show less well defined structures compared to the conduction band states. In the case of SWNT II, no clear discrete states are observed in the valence band (see supplementary information). These observations are most probably the result of an energy dependent scattering strength of the defects, respectively $d3'$-$d4$ and $d6'$-$d7$, leading here to a weaker confinement in the valence band. Such energy dependence is well known for metallic SWNTs~\\cite{Chico96,vac_2007,mayrhofer:2011,Bockrath_Science01} and is corroborated by our ab-initio calculations. Note that mixing effects with defect states and substrate-induced effects~\\cite{substrate_effects} cannot be ruled out. \\\\\n\\indent Another remarkable feature in the LDOS is the strong spatial asymmetry of the lowest energy states m1 and m-1 in QD I and m1 in QD II. In QD I, m1 is shifted to the right side of the dot while m-1 is shifted to the left side. Higher states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima relative to the center of the QD. In QD II, m1 is shifted to the right side of the QD. We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations within the QD structure (as we will show in section \\ref{1D}). For QD I, this assertion is supported by the observation of a 0.25 nm high Au(111) terrace edge located around the center of the QD, leading to a supported-suspended interface (see white dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_1}(b) and more topographic details in Fig.~S2(a)-(d) in supplementary information).",
      "This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests that a better contrast of the experimental quantized states, especially in the valence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction through $e.g.$ the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl films~\\cite{Ruffieux_Nature_2016}. This would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well as in the associated scattering physics at the confining defects~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. \n\n\\section{Conclusions and outlook} In summary, using low-temperature STM/STS measurements supported by an analytical model and ab-initio simulations, we have demonstrated that intrananotube quantum dots with confined electron and hole states characterized by energy level spacings well above thermal broadening at room temperature can be generated in semiconducting SWNTs by structural defects such as vacancies and di-vacancies, as well as nitrogen ad-atoms. These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} as well as chirality control~\\cite{tunable_QD_defects}, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices. These include $e.g.$ electrically driven single-photon emitters operating at room temperature and telecom wavelength. In this context, the observation of quantum confinement effects in the emitted light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs~\\cite{Dai_2008} shall be seen as an additional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our \"QD with leads\" building-blocks. These would include $e.g.$ studying optical transitions selection rules for different types and configurations of defect pairs~\\cite{sel_rules_2006} associated with experimental studies such as photoluminescence~\\cite{Lefebvre06} combined to $g^{(2)}$ correlation measurements~\\cite{Hofmann_2013} in suspended SWNT devices as well as photocurrent imaging~\\cite{Buchs_Nat_comm} and spectroscopy~\\cite{Gabor_2009}.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThe authors thank Ethan Minot, Lee Aspitarte, Jhon Gonzalez, Andres Ayuela, Omjoti Dutta and Arkady Krasheninnikov for fruitful discussions."

      "Furthermore, because in one embodiment the breaking news channel is personalized since the content items are compared to a model for the user, the breaking news channel is more relevant than simply a list of popular or recent news items. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to another user's channel (a friend, a famous person, etc.) that is public. Subscribing to another user's channel is advantageous because, for example, a user who is interested in the stock market will benefit by viewing the stream of content that is viewed by a famous stock market analyst. In yet another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables the user to search for channels that are public using the search engine 143. The subscription module 376, suggests such channels that are viewed by other users based on the interests of the user. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 communicates with the collaborative filtering engine 217 to suggest channels viewed by other users with whom the user has a relationship. The channel generator 378 submits a request for a stream of content for a channel to the scoring engine 211. The request includes the channel category identified by the category identifier 374 and channel attributes. The channel attributes include any attribute known to a person with ordinary skill in the art such as a source, presence of keywords, absence of keywords, a media type, a location, a time, a size of a content item, a date, etc. In one embodiment, the channel category and the channel attributes are defined by the user. In another embodiment, channel generator 378 defines the channel attributes for the channel category based on the user's preferences and activities. For example, if a user always reads news articles and seldom watches news videos, the channel generator 378 would define the media type for the channel as text based articles. At any point in time, the user can customize both the channel category and the channel attributes.",
      "The scoring server 262 then compares the candidate content items to the model and scores the candidate content items. The scoring engine 211 compares the candidate content items received from the social network server 101 to the model and rescores them according to the model. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 scores the candidate content items according to the category and any keywords associated with a channel. In either embodiment, the scoring engine 211 generates a stream of content based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content to the channel application 103. Referring now to FIG. 3A, one embodiment of a channel engine 240 is shown in more detail. The channel engine 240 includes a historical analyzer 372, a category identifier 374, a subscription module 376 and a channel generator 378 that are each coupled to signal line 230. The historical analyzer 372 is used to identify when a user will be interested in a particular category. The historical analyzer 372 identifies, for example, a time of the day or a year that a user will be interested in a category by analyzing historical trends associated with the category. In one embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 performs such analyses by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of new content items that are categorized under a content category or by measuring an increase or decrease in the number of times a new content item is accessed. For example, the number of times a tutorial on filing taxes is accessed would be very high during February-April. In another embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 also keeps track of events such as holidays, festivals, etc. Tracking such events is advantageous as, for example, many users might be interested in costume rentals during Halloween or camping during the Memorial Day and July 4th weekends. The category identifier 374 identifies a channel category for a user based on the user's interests, activities and social connections. In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 requests the model generated by the model generation engine 207 to identify the channel category.",
      "For example, the category identifier 374 identifies sports cars as a channel category because it is an explicit interest of the user. The category identifier 374 suggests channels including a source, a category, keywords, a media type, a size of a content item, and a location for a channel. For example, for a user that is interested in foreign politics, especially relations between the United States and China, the category identifier 374 suggests the category of U.S. and Chinese relations (e.g., entity=“us_china_relations”), keywords such as trade and deficit because the user is particularly interested in the economic aspect of the relationship between China and the United States, a source such as The Economist (source=“economist.com”) because the user prefers The Economist over U.S. media outlets and the media being news articles because the user does not enjoy viewing videos. In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses the analyses of the historical analyzer 374 for identifying a channel category for the user. This is advantageous as a user who has searched for US taxes might not be interested in knowing about it throughout the year, but it is beneficial for the user to have a separate channel for US taxes during the tax filing season. In yet another embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses contextual cues of the user for identifying channel categories. For example, the category identifier 374 identifies skiing in Switzerland as a channel category because winter sports is listed as an interest of the user and the user's current IP address is in Switzerland. The subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to existing channels that are public. In one embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to a pre-defined channel (such as breaking news, most popular videos, updates from a social group, etc.). The channel application 103 generates the stream of content for pre-defined channels based on global scores of the new content items. Subscribing to pre-defined channels such as breaking news is advantageous as it helps the user to keep apprised of current information and discover new interests.",

The user can also define new channels and attributes by clicking the link 420. The example includes the stream of content for the user's soccer channel 425. The stream of content includes news items 445, videos 450 and social network news feeds 455 from the content sources 440 defined by the user. The candidate content items are listed in decreasing order of their scores. The user interface engine 260 lists five candidate content items with the highest scores in the hot items section 430. The remaining candidate content items are listed in the other items section 435. In another embodiment, the entire stream of content is listed in a single section. FIG. 5 is a graphic representation 500 of a user interface that is generated by the user interface engine 260 for a user to define a new channel or customize an existing channel. In this example, the user interface includes all the channel categories 505 that have been either pre-defined, suggested to the user, or subscribed by the user, and the content sources 510 for each channel category. The user customizes a channel by adding or removing content sources for the channel. In one embodiment, the user edits more advanced channel attributes such as media type, size of the content items, etc. by clicking on the link 515. The user makes the channel public, private or restricts it to a group of people by clicking on link 520. Additionally, the user can also define a new channel by adding a new channel category.

FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a system for generating a stream of content for a channel. In this embodiment, the components of the channel application 103 are divided among various servers so that the information is efficiently processed. The system includes a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, an email server 141, a content categorizer 250, a data storage server 265, a model server 255, a scoring server 262, a social network server 101, a user device 115, and a channel application 103. A content categorizer 250 crawls the heterogeneous data sources (search server 135, entertainment server 137, ratings server 139, and email server 141) are crawled for new content items by the content categorizer 250 or the new content items are directly transmitted to the content categorizer 250. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the new content items as mentioned above with regards to FIG. 1B and stores them in the database 267 of the data storage server 265.

In one embodiment, the processing unit 202 stores the database 267. In one embodiment, the data storage server 265 dynamically phases out the old content items. For example, news items expire after 24 hours, videos expire after 48 hours and feeds are kept for 24 hours or only the 10 most recent items, whichever is larger, etc. The content categorizer 250 also transmits the new content items to the scoring server 262 for a global user ranking. The global scores are transmitted from the scoring server 262 to the data storage server 265, which stores the global scores in association with the new content items. The global scores are helpful for organizing the new content items in the data storage server 265 according to the more popular items.",
      "Turning now to the model server 255, the model server 255 receives the user's activity, interests and social connections from the processing unit 202 or the data storage server 265.

The model server 255 transmits a model to the scoring server 262 and the channel application 103 periodically or upon request. The channel application 103 includes a channel engine 240 and a user interface engine 260. In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 requests the model from the model server 255 and identifies a channel category that a user would find interesting. The channel engine 240 then transmits a request for a stream of content to the scoring server 262. The channel engine 240 receives the stream of content from the scoring server 262 and generates the channel. The user interface engine 260 generates a user interface for displaying a user interface that includes the channel and transmits it to the user device 115. In addition, the user interface engine 260 generates a user interface to allow the user to customize the channel or define a new channel. These user interfaces are explained in greater detail below with regard to FIGS. 4-5. In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 transmits a query based on the channel category to the scoring server 262.

      "He is also an author, a journalist, and radio commentator. To his right is Roland Homet. He is an information policy writer and thinker who recently opened his own public policy writing firm here in Washington -- it's called Executive Ink, not Inc., as it is written in your programs, so you can scratch that out. Esther Dyson, at the end of the panel, is among the most respected commentators on developing technology trends in the personal computer business. She publishes two newsletters, Release 1.0 and Rel-EAST. She has also been one of the driving forces promoting East-West relations through computer networks. She is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation as well. I'll ask Peter to start. P. DENNING: Thank you. Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their governments to regulate commerce, erase inequities, and build societies of better human beings. For over a hundred years, many people, from peasants to intellectuals, had faith that strong governments would bring them a better life. This faith was part of the clearing in which Communist governments flourished; although the United States took an anti-Communist stand, the same faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by great national programs including Social Security, welfare, food stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society. This faith is now shattered. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life. The dramatic collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people for federal, state, and local governments. The poor track record of government is not the only reason for the shift. Information technology has accelerated the process. Communications that took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions. Radio, TV, fax, and now E-mail are common worldwide, so much so that not even a powerful government can control what information its citizens have.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society.",
      "Because the space of opportunity for people to engage in transactions with each other has been so enormously enlarged during the past decade, faith in marketplace democracies is on the rise worldwide; correspondingly faith in central management mechanisms is on the decline. This shift has brought with it a shift of the power of institutions. Government institutions tend to try to hold onto their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways. This can produce big tensions and even promote breakage. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the cryptographic area which we have just been talking about in the previous hour. This technology, cryptography, produces mechanisms for digital signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and private communication -- all offering a way for standard business practices now based on paper to be shifted into the electronic media. The success of worldwide enterprises depends on this shift being completed rapidly and effectively. As more people realize this, the momentum for incorporating cryptographic technology into the information infrastructure is accelerating. In this country, the National Security Agency has long been given the authority to regulate cryptography. This authority was granted in another time when the success of the country depended upon the ability of its government to gather intelligence and communicate in secret. These premises made sense in a world where most of the power resided in governments, but the world is changing. Much economic power is now accumulating in large apolitical transnational corporations. These corporations place their own concerns and strategies ahead of those of governments of the countries in which they do business. Like governments, they are interested in gathering intelligence about competitors and in conducting business in private. Unlike governments, they want open access to the technologies of authentication, electronic money, digital signatures, and certificates that will allow them to conduct business transactions across the network."

      "Nick Fazekas, 6-11, PF, Nevada Junior No First round pick? Fazekas announced hell be entering the draft without an agent and will likely return to Nevada if it looks like hes not going to be a first round pick. If hes not a first rounder this year, its hard to imagine him ever being one since there isnt much left for him to accomplish individually in the NCAA. An interesting candidate for the pre-draft camp in Orlando. Thomas Gardner, 6-5, SG, Missouri Junior No Second round pick? The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that Gardner will enter the draft. Firing of underachieving Missouri coach Quin Snyder appeared to be the straw the broke the camels back. Gardner will have to hope to get invited to Orlando, but moving into the first round appears unlikely without an incredible performance there. Rudy Gay, 6-8, SF, UConn Sophomore Yes Top 10 pick Gay announced hes leaving UConn at a press conference on campus, with Coach Calhoun by his side. He will hire an agent eventually. Size, length, incredible talent and athleticism means he might have the most upside of any player in this draft. Does he have the fire to capitalize on it though? Reggie George, 6-10, PF, Robert Morris Chicago (NAIA) Junior No Undrafted Transfer from Iowa State had a nice season in the NAIA and is looking to capitalize on it by gaining some exposure for himself. Daniel Gibson, 6-2, PG/SG, Texas Sophomore ??? Second round pick As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Gibson will be entering the draft. There appears to be a conflict between Gibson and Texas regarding what his role will be next year, specifically whether or not hell be playing the point, meaning its unclear whether or not hell be returning. Gibson will likely go to Orlando to help him decide what his next step is. Showing off some PG skills will be essential there. Aaron Gray, 7-0, Center, Pitt Junior No First round pick? After a disappointing end to his season, being outplayed by Patrick OBryant in the NCAA tournament, Gray has put that behind him and entered his name in the draft without an agent.",
      "Lute Olson confirmed it, saying he is not concerned about it. Shakur is hoping for an Orlando invite to show what he thinks he couldnt at Point Guard U.\nCedric Simmons, 6-9, PF/C, NC State Sophomore No First round pick? Simmons is reportedly \"exploring his options,\" in regards to the 2006 NBA draft, but will do so without an agent. Nice size, frame, length, athleticism and defensive skills make him a very intriguing prospect. Marcus Slaughter, 6-8, PF, San Diego State Junior Yes Second round pick? After burning his lone draft card a year early last June, despite being considered a marginal prospect, Slaughter has announced that he will be hiring agent Dan Fegan and forfeiting his remaining college eligibility. Slaughters father thinks that There was nothing else for Marcus to do at San Diego State. Many would disagree with that. Curtis Stinson, 6-3, PG/SG, Iowa State Junior Yes Second round pick After swearing up and down last month that he has no intention on entering the draft, Stinson did just that. His coach Wayne Morgan, who he was very close to, was fired, resulting in him hiring agent Kevin Bradbury. The 23 year old combo guard will have to go to the Orlando pre-draft camp and impress if he wants to come close to being a 1st rounder. Tyrus Thomas, 6-9, PF, LSU Freshman Yes Top 5 pick As DraftExpress exclusively reported Thomas called a press conference to announce his intentions to enter the 2006 NBA draft, as well as hire agents Brian Elfus and Mike Siegel. SEC Freshman of the year could be the most athletic player in the draft, as well as the player with the most overall upside. PJ Tucker, 6-5, SF, Texas Junior No Second round pick As reported all year long by DraftExpress, Tucker will be entering the draft without an agent. Considering that hes a 6-5 combo forward with tremendous skills, his stock widely fluctuates depending on who is being asked. Phenomenal basketball player, but is severely lacking in 2-3 inches of height. Will likely need a strong showing at the Orlando pre-draft camp to have a legitimate shot at the 1st round.",
      "Level of competition is mediocre in American semi-pro ABA league, which makes him an intriguing candidate for Orlando pre-draft camp. Ali Traore, 6-9, PF, Roanne 1985 France ??? Puts up nice numbers in France. Will participate at the Reebok Eurocamp in Treviso. Ejike Ugboaja, 6-8, PF, Union Bank Lagos 1985 Nigeria Undrafted Plays for Nigerian National Team. Goran Dragic, 6-4, PG, Geoplin Slovan 1986 Agent initially notified us that Dragic will be entering the draft, but in the end decided to keep him out. His buyout was always a question mark. Leigh Enobakhare, 6-10, Center, Oostende 1986 Agent Ugo Udezue from BDA Sports Management told us that Enobakhare will be entering the draft. In the end he must have heard that he is not considered a prospect at all, and decided to keep him out of the draft. Cartier Martin, 6-8, SF/PF, Kansas State Junior Martin pondered entering his name in the draft, especially after the firing of Kansas State coach Jim Wooldridge.\nNick Young, 6-6, SG, USC Sophomore Young told the LA Daily News in February that hes staying at USC for another year. D.J. Strawberry, 6-5, SG/SF, Maryland Junior Strawberry initially intended to test the waters, but eventually ended up not doing so once he found out that his chances of being drafted are almost non-existent. Al Thornton, 6-7, SF/PF, Florida State Sophomore Implied earlier on in the year that he might put his name in, but sources recently told us it appears that he will return for his senior year. Tallahassee media backs this up. Marcus Williams (AZ), 6-8, SG/SF, Arizona Freshman After initially appearing to be gone after numerous definitive reports, Williams surprised everyone and thrilled Arizona fans by announcing in a press conference hell be returning for his sophomore year. Josh McRoberts, 6-11, PF, Duke Freshman After being upset by LSU in the Sweet Sixteen, McRoberts was quoted saying Ill be at Duke next year.. Duke issued a press release a month later confirming this. Yi Jianlian, 7-0, PF, Guangdong 1987?",
      "Athletic and long, but still lacking any type of polish. Donald Jeffers, 6-8, PF, Roxbury Community College Sophomore No Undrafted Anonymous junior college player. Alexander Johnson, 6-9, PF, Florida State Junior Yes First round pick? Sources told DraftExpress, that Johnson will be hiring an agent, mainly because he is already 23 years old. Hes considered intriguing because of his strength, raw offensive tools and freakish athleticism at the 4 position, and could work his way into the 1st round with strong workouts. David Johnson, 6-7, PF, Clinton Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted 6-7 JUCO power forward who averaged 2 points and 3 rebounds per game. Trey Johnson, 6-5, SG, Jackson State Junior No Undrafted Small school prolific scorer and one of the most accurate perimeter shooters in the country will attempt to draw some more attention to himself by testing the waters this summer. Johnson is hoping for a chance to prove himself in the Orlando pre-draft camp in June. Coby Karl, 6-4, PG/SG, Boise State Junior No Undrafted Son of Denver Nuggets head Coach George Karl put up nice numbers (17 ppg, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 39.5% 3P) in the underrated WAC conference. Had surgery in March to remove a cancerous lump from his thyroid. Mark Konecny, 6-10, Center, Lambuth (NAIA) Junior No Undrafted Transfer from Syracuse with mediocre production is looking for any type of exposure he can get before he graduates next season. Kyle Lowry, 6-1, PG, Villanova Sophomore No First round pick NCAA tournament performance showed that he definitely needs another year, but regardless, Lowry is in. For now its without an agent. Considering the lack of quality point guard prospects in this draft, Lowry is likely a first round pick. Says he will attend the Orlando pre-draft camp if invited. Aleks Maric, 6-11, Center, Nebraska Sophomore No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Maric will be testing the waters. What may have played a role in this is the fact that the assistant coach that recruited him at Nebraska, Scott Spinelli, just moved on to Wichita State.",
      "Pinnock will attempt to capitalize on his teams success this year by potentially attending the NBA pre-draft camp in Orlando. Pinnock will have to show better ball-handling and perimeter shooting ability than he did during the regular season. Leon Powe, 6-7, PF, Cal Sophomore No Second round pick Powe announced hell be testing the waters in a statement released by Cal. Where he ends up being projected depends heavily on how his knee checks out. Powe is already considered a serious tweener by NBA scouts, and had a hard time this season gaining back much of the explosiveness he had earlier in his career. Could realistically go undrafted should he decide to stay in. Richard Roby, 6-5, SG, Colorado Sophomore Likely Second round pick As first indicated by DraftExpress Roby has decided to test the waters. Disappeared against any major competition he went up against, particularly towards the end of the season. Roby will likely have to put on weight in the next few months and show off his perimeter stroke in the Orlando pre-draft camp. Sources tell us that he is on the verge of making a huge mistake by hiring an agent. Rajon Rondo, 6-2, PG, Kentucky Sophomore Yes First round pick As expected, Rondo has decided to enter the NBA draft, and has also hired an agent, Bill Duffy. Despite an inconsistent sophomore season, most scouts weve spoken to still had him as at least the #2 point guard on their board because of his intriguing upside. Workouts will be huge for him. Blake Schilb, 6-7, SG/SF, Loyola Chicago Junior No Undrafted Declared his intentions to enter the draft, without an agent, and is hoping for an invite to Orlando. Schlib is sorely lacking in the quickness and explosiveness departments that scouts demand from swingman prospects, but he makes up for it with his skill set to a certain extent. Regardless, sources tell us he wont be invited to Orlando, meaning he has to go back to school. Mustafa Shakur, 6-4, PG, Arizona Junior No Second round pick? According to the Arizona Star, Shakur will likely enter his name in the draft, without an agent."

      "The development of schemes for checking TNE state, extracting TNE information and describing corresponding TNE effects in DBM are seen in Table . Actually, this set of TNE describing methods has been applied in many kinds of complex fluid systems such as hydrodynamic instability system , combustion and detonation systems , multiphase flow system , plasma system , etc. Besides the scheme for detecting, describing, presenting, and analyzing TNE effects and behaviors, the DBM incorporates other methods for analyzing the complex physical field. One of them is the tracer particle method. The introduction of the tracer particle method makes the gradually blurred interface appear clearly . The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 shows Year Scheme for investigating TNE effects and behaviors Before 2012 Two classes of LBMs did not show a significant difference in physical function. 2012 Use the non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) to check and describe TNE . This is the starting point of current DBM approach. 2015 Open TNE phase space based on non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) and define a TNE strength using the distance from a state point to the origin. This is the starting point of the phase space description method . 2018 Extend the distance concepts in phase space to describe the TNE difference/similarity of TNE states and kinetic processes . 2021 Further extend the phase space description methodology to any set of system characteristics . the modeling method. Then, the numerical simulations and results are presented in Section 3, which includes two subsections. Section 4 concludes the paper. Other complementary information is given in the Appendix. Model construction\n\nBased on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) singlerelaxation model, a two-fluid DBM with a flexible specific-heat ratio is presented in this part. From the origin Boltzmann equation to a DBM, four fundamental steps are needed: (i) Simplification and modification of the Boltzmann equation according to the research requirement.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "(ii) Discretization of the particle velocity space under the condition that the reserved kinetic moments keep their values unchanged. (iii) Checking the TNE state and extracting TNE information. (iv) The selection/design of the boundary conditions. Simplification and modification of the Boltzmann equation\n\nAs we know, the collision term in the original Boltzmann contains high dimensional distribution functions. Therefore, the direct solution to it needs too much computing consumption. The most common method to simplify the collision operator is to introduce a local equilibrium distribution function ( f eq ) and write the complex collision operator in a linearized form, i.e., the original BGK collision operator − 1 τ ( f − f eq ), where τ is the relaxation time . The original BGK operator describes the situation where the system is always in the quasi-equilibrium state. Namely, it characterizes only the situation where the Kn number of the system is small enough and f ≈ f eq . The currently used BGK operator for non-equilibrium flows in the field is a modified version incorporating the meanfield theory description . Based on the above considerations, the simplified Boltzmann equation describing the SBI process is where the two-dimensional equilibrium distribution function is ) where ρ, T , v, u, I, R, and η are the mass density, temperature, particle velocity vector, flow velocity vector, the number of the extra degrees of freedom including molecular rotation and vibration inside the molecules, gas constant, and a free parameter that describes the energy of the extra degrees of freedom, respectively. The specific-heat ratio is flexible by adjusting parameter I, i.e., γ = (D + I + 2)/(D + I), where D = 2 represents the two-dimensional space. Discretization of the particle velocity space and determination of f σ ,eq i\n\nThe continuous Boltzmann equation should be discretized for simulating. Specifically, the continuous velocity space can be replaced by a limited number of particle velocities."

(From Preserve Plum Island website)\nLast Thursday, March 24, at a press conference in Old Saybrook, a triumvirate of Congressional legislators from Connecticut, State Senator Richard Blumenthal and US Representatives Joe Courtney (D-2nd District) and Rosa DeLauro (D-3rd District) confirmed their support for a study to determine the future of Plum Island located in Long Island Sound. Members of the Plum Island Coalition — which has some 65 member organizations all dedicated to preserving the island — were in attendance to hear the good news. The island still houses a high-security, federal animal disease research facility, but the decision has already been taken to move the facility to a new location in Kansas with an opening slated for 2022. The current facility takes up only a small percentage of the land on the island and significantly for environmentalists, the remainder of the island has for years been left to nature in the wild. In supporting a federal study on the future of Plum Island, Sen. Blumenthal said, “This study is a step towards saving a precious, irreplaceable national treasure from developers and polluters. It will provide the science and fact-based evidence to make our case for stopping the current Congressional plan to sell Plum Island to the highest bidder.”",

There are two basic groups of thalassemia disorders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These conditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which can range from insignificant to life threatening. All types of thalassemias are considered quantitative diseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemoglobin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemoglobin is made up of three components: alpha globin, beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classified according to the globin that is affected, hence the names alpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of thalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and beta thalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Beta thalassemia may be the most best-known type of thalassemia and is also called Cooley's anemia. It is caused by a change in the gene for the beta globin component of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemia that can range from moderate to severe, depending in part on the exact genetic change underlying the disease. Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinical symptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe anemia that can occur within months after birth. If left untreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growth and development, as well as other common physical complications that can lead to a dramatically decreased life-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries beta thalassemia is usually identified by screening in the newborn period, before symptoms have developed. Children who are identified early can be started on ongoing blood transfusion therapy as needed.",

      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts.",
      "In recent years, there have been a handful of infants with this condition who have survived long-term. Most of these infants received experimental treatment including transfusions before birth, early delivery, and even bone marrow transplantation before birth, although the latter procedure has not yet been successful. For those infants that survive to delivery, there seems to be an increased risk of developmental problems and physical effects, particularly heart and genital malformations. Otherwise, their medical outlook is similar to a child with beta thalassemia major, with the important exception that ongoing, life-long blood transfusions begin right at birth. As discussed above, the prognosis for individuals with the most serious types of thalassemia has improved drastically in the last several years following recent medical advances in transfusion, chemo-, and transplantation therapy.

      "So that the values of continuous kinetic moments can be obtained from the summation form of kinetic moments. In this process, it requires the reserved kinetic moments, which are used to characterize the system behaviors, keep their values unchanged after discretizing the velocity space. Namely, f the reserved kinetic moments. According to the CE analysis, f can be expressed by f eq . Therefore, in the process of discretization, the reserved kinetic moments of f eq should keep their values unchanged, i.e., where i represents the kind of discrete velocities and α (α = x or y) is the direction in cartesian coordinate. To simulate the interaction between two different fluids, a two-fluid DBM should be constructed. Based on the singlerelaxation model, the discrete two-fluid Boltzmann equation can be written as : where σ represents the types of material particle and f σ ,eq i = f σ ,eq i (ρ σ , u, T). In two-fluid DBM, the macroscopic quantities of the mixture and each component are\nwhere ρ σ and u σ are the mass density and flow velocity of the component σ , respectively. ρ and u represent the mass density and flow velocity of the mixture, respectively. There exist two kinds of temperature (internal energy) definitions in two-fluid DBM because the definition of temperature (internal energy) depends on the flow velocity to be chosen as a reference.

The corresponding definitions of temperature for component σ and the mixture are\nwhere ∆E * I is It is clear to see that these two definitions of temperature for mixture are the same, but for temperature of component σ are different. We choose the first definition in this manuscript. To solve the Eq. ( ), it is necessary to determine the values of f σ ,eq i . Its values depend on the reserved kinetic moments which characterize the main system behaviors.",
      "In DBM modeling, the CE multiscale analysis is used to determine quickly the reserved kinetic moments. Specifically, when constructing a DBM which only the first order term of Kn number is retained (i.e., only the first order TNE effects are retained), seven kinetic moments should be reserved, i.e., the M 0 , M 1 , M 2,0 , M 2 , M 3,1 , M 3 , M 4,2 . Two more kinetic moments ( M 4 and M 5,3 ) are needed when the second order TNE is considered . However, it should be noted that the function of CE analysis in DBM modeling is only to determine the kinetic moments that need to be preserved. Whether or not to derive the hydrodynamic equations does not affect the DBM simulation. The kinetic moments used in our physical modeling are shown in the Appendix B. Their expressions can be obtained by integrating v and η with continuous-form f eq . For better understanding, the Appendix C gives the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations recovered from the Boltzmann equation. The kinetic moments in Appendix B can be written in matrix form, i.e., C • f σ ,eq = fσ,eq , (\nwhere C is the matrix of discrete velocity and feq represents the kinetic moments. A proper discrete velocity model is needed to confirm the values of f σ ,eq i . The f σ ,eq can be obtained by solving the inverse matrix, i.e., f σ ,eq = C −1 • fσ,eq , where C −1 is the inverse matrix of C. It is very convenient to obtain the inverse matrix of C through some mathematical softwares such as Mathematica, etc. The D2V16 model is chosen in this paper, its sketches can be seen in Fig. . The specific values of D2V16 are given in the following equations: where \"cyc\" indicates cyclic permutation and c is an adjustable parameter of the discrete velocity model. The sketch of η in D2V16 is η i = η 0 for i = 1 − 4, and η i = 0 for i = 5 − 16.

      "Akl et. al. proposed 18 gesture dictionary based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier \\cite{akl11}. Wrist-worn ACC based postural activity recognition approach has been proposed using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and deep neural networks \\cite{gj14, wang16}, the accuracy stagnates at 85\\% using SVM method \\cite{martin16}. However, neither of past works proposed any technique that can provide single body worn ACC sensor-based multiple body contexts recognition nor works efficiently for diverse posture say walking normally, with walker, with double walker or wheel chair. Our proposed 8-hand gesture recognition technique assisted sparse-deconvolution method improves classification performances on both normal and diverse postures. However, we incorporated hand gestures and postures in conjunction with ambient sensors into single-inhabitant HDBN model \\cite{alam16b} that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition.\n\\subsection{Cognitive Health Assessment}\nSmart home environment has been used for providing automated health monitoring and assessment in the ageing population before \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}. `SmartFABER' proposed a non-intrusive sensor network based continuous smart home environmental sensor data acquisition and a novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique to analyz the data to estimate behavioral anomalies for early detection of mild-cognitively impairment \\cite{riboni16}. \\cite{skubic15} presented an example of unobtrusive, continuous monitoring system for the purpose of assessing early health changes to alert caregivers about the potential signs of health hazards. Though, prior researches proposed a sequence of ambient motion sensor streams as complex activity components in activity based health assessment \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}, we consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings to help recognize complex activities as well as cognitive health assessment of older adults.",
      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures. The method comprises of the following steps: (i) \\emph{Preprocessing:} wrist-worn ACC sensor provided 3-axis data are passed through 0.4Hz low-pass filter to remove the data drift.",
      "Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults. \\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation} In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity.",
      "Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:\n\n{\\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. {\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition. {\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method. Then, we apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier \\cite{cao06} to classify final postural activity. Fig.~\\ref{fig:deconvolution} illustrates a single axis example of the deconvolution. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\n   \\epsfig{file=deconvolution.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Sample deconvolution example of X-axis.

I don't know how to help him with it and because he's almost 19 I have limited control now. It's made my life easier knowing what we're dealing with and I think his life would be easier is he accepted it. Please help me help him. I am a clinical psychologist in NYC who now has several (!!) children I see who have RAD. In 20 years of practice, I’d seen only one case. Now, I have at least three children with this. I have no training, per se, in working with this children though I know about setting structure, consistency, etc. I do a lot of work with parents about parenting. I work primarily within the school setting in a charter school whose mission is to educate children on the autism spectrum in a mainstream setting. We use Michelle Garcia Winner’s social thinking program with our ASD kids. I also work with gen ed kids in the school who are at-risk; the school is in the inner city from where the majority of our non-ASD kids live. It would have been so much easier to mention to my adult son that I think (I know he does, but want to ease into the subject)\nhe has Asperger's when we were living together two years ago. He has since moved to Tennessee working in his field of interest\nwhich is 3-D printing and software development. I am so happy for him that he has found his way into a job that he truly enjoys\neven though he's socially isolated. He's not diagnosed and does not know he has it. How I know is his classic symptoms being sensory issues (fabric feeling like sandpaper)\ncommunication difficulties, meltdowns and much more. Throughout his childhood I just felt he was a bit different. Nothing major stood out and time\njust passes, misdiagnosis of ADHD, low frustration, etc. We've talked about his ADHD numerous times (which I now know he doesn't have). It's so much easier to communicate with him now that I know he has Asperger's. I keep it \"slow and low\" in talking, with long moments\nof silence and then we connect.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations.",
      "And as of now he only keeps in contact with one of them who still lives in Georgia. We have lived in Utah since the summer of 2007 and he has never had a friend to do things with since we have lived here. He has two younger siblings, a brother 22 and a sister 20. They love Taylor and spend time with him when they are home. They are both at college and doing well. Throughout Taylor's school years he has seen a counsleor on a fairly regular basis. One summer during junior high he attended a weekly class where he interacted with other kids with Aspergers. We did see a lot of change in him from this group. After he returned from his mission he went to see a counselor for a short period - this counselor tried to help him with some social skills. His dad and I went with him the first 3 or 4 times but we found out that after we quit going with him he only went a few more times and then scheduled appointments but did not show a couple of the times. We only found this out when a bill came for a \"no show\" appointment. I don't know if this is too much information but were are in dire need of help for him. In the information that we purchased from you you mentioned that you do coaching for Aspergers adults. I don't know if you can help us but I thought I would check with you just in case. Alas I think I have found your information too late to save my marriage but I am hoping to save myself. I am currently going through a very very painful separation after a 27 year relationship with my husband whom I am convinced has aspergers syndrome. It is a long and painful story and I am desperately trying to process it all alongside dealing with a very conflictual separation. My partner is angry non communicative and totally dismissive of me and our long shared history. He walked out last year after I discovered he had been visiting massage parlours and developed a relationship with an illegal Chinese escourt whom he subsequently moved in with. He had been seeing this woman behind my back for over 18 months. The pain of all this indescribable and his dismissal of my pain and very existence beyond belief.",
      "Thank you for your assistance. I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling.",
      "I have loads of books I have bought, attended psychiatrists for my son and myself, family therapy, occupational therapy, begged and prayed for change but have been dealing with behavioural issues for so long I am definitely exhausted and resentful. I am a mum to a 15 yr old boy with ASD, dyslexia, OCD and ODD. Sorry to focus on the labels but just to give you an idea of what I am dealing with. I also have a 13 yr old son whom finds his brother’s behaviours difficult, embarassing and challenging. My husband whom is not in great health ( he had a cerebral aneurysm clamped two years ago and has two further aneurysms that are inoperable so endures fatigue, headaches and stress). We have however a pet cat that is very social and a calming influence in the home! I was fortunate enough to have loving parents but I lost both my mum and dad in 2008 and 2015. My inlaws are elderly and quite directly say they are too old to help us so it feels we are alone in dealing with the issues we have. I am desperate for change as the household is one of stress and anger and I feel all the control lies in my son Patrick’s hands. I am hopeful your programme can make life better for all of us but I wonder if it is too early to ask you two questions? The first lies with what to do when Patrick goes into my other son Brendan’s room and will either turn on a light when he is sleeping, yell when he is on his phone or create some disturbance. He will not leave the room when asked to do so and the situation always escalates into yelling and Brendan attempting to physically remove him. This happens regularly and always ends badly with doors slamming, my husband being woken and myself in tears feeling the lack of control and also I admit I seem to think “Why me?” which rationally I know is of no help. The second problem is leaving the house for school. Patrick refuses personal hygiene (either morning or night) and any request to even brush his teeth is fraught with swearing and abuse. If I can get him to shower, he will watch the water roll down the drain and turn up the water really high temp (mu husband has had to turn down the thermostat on the hot water service) without so much as getting wet."

Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS). While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953. Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955. On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.",

Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship . When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940. World War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942. By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best. During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B.

Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command. Early life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S.

He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy. Revolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy. The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier. Later service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B.

      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary. Seating is luxurious for one. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale. The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front. Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location. The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.",
      "Shopping for the Partially Built KR. This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly. Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me. After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

      "\\section*{Dynamical Behaviour of $O$ in Lattice Gases}\n\nThe dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order parameter  $m$ [see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-m} in the Letter] following a quench to the critical point is well described by\nthe Gaussian theory for all the three lattice gas models studied, $i.e.,$ driven lattice gas with either constant (IDLG) or random (RDLG) infinite drive and equilibrium lattice gas (LG). In other words, in the short-time regime, $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:mt}] and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode [defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:binder}] is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter $O,$ however, distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. In order to understand  this, we first write the phenomenological scaling form for $O$,  analogous to Eq. \\eqref{eq:scalingass} in  the Letter,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO (t, L_{\\parallel} ; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O (t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)} ; S_\\Delta).\\quad\n\\label{eq:Oscalingass}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe already remarked that, in the LG, this scaling form is not compatible with the prediction $O \\sim t^{1/8}  L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$ of the Gaussian theory. However, following Ref. \\cite{AS2002}, it can be argued that, at short times, the only dependence of $O$ on the system size $L_{\\parallel}$ is of the form $O \\sim L_\\parallel^{-1/2}$ which is very well confirmed by numerical simulations. Accordingly,  the generic behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_\\parallel^{-1/2}, \\label{eq:O}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined. This, along with Eq. \\eqref{eq:Oscalingass}, implies $\\tilde f_O(x) \\sim x^{\\alpha}.$ Comparing the finite-size behaviour in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:O} with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:Oscalingass} one actually infers,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\alpha &=& \\frac{1+ \\Delta -2 \\beta/\\nu}{2 \\, (4- \\eta)}. \\label{eq:alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis equation, together with the hyperscaling relation $\\Delta - 2 \\beta/\\nu= - \\eta$ in two spatial dimensions, shows that the prediction $\\alpha = 1/8$ of the Gaussian theory [see Eq.",
      "\\eqref{eq:Ot}] can be obtained only when $\\eta=0,$ which is the case for the IDLG (exactly) and the RDLG (approximately) but not for the LG. On the other hand,  Eq.~\\eqref{eq:alpha} predicts $\\alpha = 1/10$ upon substituting the values of the critical exponents corresponding to the Ising  universality class (LG). This is consistent with the numerical simulation results presented in the main text, see Fig. \\ref{fig:ising}(b) therein. \\begin{figure}[th]\n\\vspace*{0.2 cm} \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{./compare_binder.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Comparison between the temporal evolution of the Binder cumulants $g$ corresponding to the $12^{th}$ transverse mode, $i.e.,$ with $n_\\perp =12,$ in the LG (lowest curve), IDLG and RDLG (two upper curves) on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. \\label{fig:b}}\n \\label{fig:binder}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe emergence of this new value $1/10$ of the exponent $\\alpha$ must be traced back to the non-Gaussian nature of higher fluctuating modes in the LG. In fact, even though the lowest mode behaves identically in all the three models we considered,  characterized by the same behaviour of $m$, higher modes show a significant difference in the non-driven case. To illustrate this, we measured the Binder cumulants of higher modes which is defined  analogously to Eq.~(11), using transverse modes other than the first, i.e., with $\\mu=\\tilde \\sigma(0,2 \\pi n_\\bot/L_\\bot)$ and $n_\\bot>1.$  \n Figure \\ref{fig:b} compares the same for all the three lattice gases for the mode with $n_\\perp =12$ on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. Clearly, the curve corresponding to the LG (lowest, blue) departs from Gaussian behaviour $g=0$ (in practice, $e.g.,$ $|g| \\lesssim 0.005,$ corresponding to the shaded gray area) much earlier than it does for the IDLG  or RDLG (two upper curves, red and green respectively). Accordingly, the different dynamical behaviour of $O$, which involves a sum over all modes, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian nature of the higher modes in the LG. Such a departure is not entirely surprising.",
      "(\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases. The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}. With \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal. Otherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textcolor{red}{\nF: comment about quenched:",

      "Christians still die. But at the very end of the Bible we see that when Christ returns, death will finally be thrown into the lake of fire and be no more. All the dead will come to life—but this time never to die again. I can’t help but think of John Donne’s Holy Sonnet X: Death Be Not Proud:\nDeath, be not proud, though some have called thee\nMighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\nFor those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow\nFrom rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be\nMuch pleasure; then from thee much more must flow\nAnd soonest our best men with thee do go\nRest of their bones and soul’s delivery. And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\nAnd poppies or charms can make us sleep as well\nAnd better than thy stroke. Why swellst thou then? And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die! Today we sit knowing that we are no longer spiritually dead, and instead we are dead to sin. Christ has risen from the dead, but He has not yet returned. Physical death is still a reality. It’s still cruel. But it’s not the end. I have another friend, a learned scholar who is emphatic about how much he hates death. He doesn’t want to die. Yet Paul almost seems to disagree. In Philippians he writes, “To live is Christ and to die is gain.” Is death gain? Is there something good about death—our deaths? Is my death-hating friend overreacting? Insofar as my friend is only talking about death, he’s right. You can’t really hate death enough. And our hope is in the resurrection, when we get our new bodies and live with Christ forever. Paul’s not saying that death isn’t really so bad after all. He’s saying Christ means so much to him that he would even suffer death to be with Him. It’s not that death is lesser; it’s that Jesus is greater. This is how we make sense of Paul’s taunt in 1 Corinthians 15, which talks at length about the resurrection: “Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” Ultimately he’s talking about the end of death when we are raised, but there’s a sense in which death’s sting is tempered by the sweetness of life with Jesus.",
      "Jesus, being fully God, lives a perfectly sinless life—a life not meriting death—and dies on our behalf, paying for all the sin of the world. Let that sink in for a moment: God dies. But the death of God becomes the death of sin, and the death of sin becomes the death of death. And death’s final defeat is announced through the resurrection of God back from the dead. The God of life is alive! And He offers eternal life to all. As Tim Keller likes to put it, Jesus died the death we deserved so that we could live the life He deserved. Because Jesus submitted to death on our behalf, our relationship with death gets really complicated. It’s still the enemy. It’s still the wages of sin. It’s still not good. But every good thing—salvation, resurrection, eternal life, peace with God—these all came from one great death: the Crucifixion. So now all death is bad, but that one death brought us everything good. We praise the God of life, but we celebrate His death. God took a horrible, terrible, rotten, no-good thing and redeemed it. I suppose that shouldn’t surprise us either. We may sometimes look like we’re rejoicing in death itself, but really we rejoice in that one death that God used to bring eternal life. Our problem isn’t that we sing about death too much—we probably don’t sing about it enough! But we have to keep it in the context of the bigger story. We can’t make any sense of the Crucifixion apart from the Fall, the Resurrection, and Return of Christ. This is the theme we see in the Book of Acts: God raised Jesus from the dead. It’s all about resurrection now! We baptize in the likeness of His death—and resurrection. We take the bread and cup to remember His death—all the while waiting for His return. In Romans, death takes on a whole new meaning: since our sins were buried with Christ, we are now alive to God and dead to sin. Spiritual death is over now. Death has become just a metaphor for our relationship with sin. But make no mistake, death didn’t just die spiritually. We might think that because we still see death all around us.",
      "When we lose a loved one, it’s hard. If he or she is a believer, we’re comforted by the fact that even though they died they enjoy the sweetness of Christ’s presence. Don’t let anyone take that away from you. Just don’t forget: that’s not the end of the story. It gets better! They won’t stay dead. Who is this God who can even bring good out of death? Today is Ash Wednesday. Many Christians will receive ash on their foreheads and be reminded, “You are dust, and to dust you will return.” Not a message we particularly like to hear. We often think of ourselves as souls who just happen to be in bodies, that our parts are interchangeable—maybe even expendable. But these words are the words God Himself spoke to Adam after the Fall. You are dust. A sobering thought. Our bodies are a part of us, and our reflection is a daily reminder that we’re not as strong as we think we are. That’s not the whole truth about us, but it’s a part we can’t afford to forget. Considering our frailty and our mortality shouldn’t lead to despair; it should bring us to our knees before our Savior. We confess how much we need Him, and how grateful we are that we have Him. Recognizing our insufficiency is just one way we deepen our appreciation for all we have in Christ. We humble ourselves not to make Him greater but because He is greater! He has brought us forgiveness and eternal life, sent us His Spirit. If we were left to our own devices, we would have no hope. But because of His love, rich in mercy, we have this gift from God.

      "We sometimes get confused about the role death plays in God’s plan. So today we examine what the Bible says about death and reconsider what role it plays in our lives. It’s interesting: there’s a way in which you could read the Bible as a book about death. That’s obviously not all it talks about, but the “story arc” of death spans the entire book. Let’s take a stroll, shall we? The first mention of death is in the second chapter of the Bible: “in the day you eat of [the forbidden fruit] you will surely die” (Genesis 2:17). This promise was the center of the debate between the woman and the serpent in Genesis 3, and they ate of the fruit. But they didn’t die. God was gracious not to put them to death physically, but there is a kind of spiritual death that took place then. Since the Fall, mankind has been unresponsive to God. But make no mistake, physical death was coming. We know from Romans that death entered through Adam’s sin—it wasn’t part of the original created order. And as proof, we see in Adam’s genealogy the reign of death: each one dies. We read “and he died” over and over here. Romans 3:23 tells us “the wages of sin is death.” All sinned, so all die. Death had become a part of life. But Genesis is just getting warmed up! Because next comes the Flood where—you guessed it—everybody dies. Then the Patriarchs die. Then the book ends with the death of Joseph. Who ends a book that way?!? This is not a happy ending. But then there’s Exodus, where the Egyptians die, Leviticus where animals die, Numbers where unbelieving Israel dies, Joshua where the Canaanites die. Death is everywhere! It’s all over the Pentateuch. Why would this be? Because death is the punishment for sin. All crimes against God are capital offenses. That doesn’t mean He immediately smites everyone the moment they sin—but technically speaking, He could. That would be just. And if it doesn’t feel just then maybe we don’t understand sin as well as we thought we did. In Ezekiel, God tells us He gets no pleasure from the death of the wicked."

      "In all cases, the integrated transgenes are under the control of the CMV promoter in the context of a pcDNA3.1 plasmid, are partially silenced, and can be efficiently upregulated by HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A, TSA; ref. and S3A, S3B and S4A Figs), indicating that their expression is controlled at least in part by epigenetic mechanisms, as previously described . To establish whether the reactivation response results from the shortage of specific AAs only, such as Met/Cys, or it is triggered by any AA deprivations, we cultured HeLa-OA1, HeLa-GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells for 24–48 hours with a battery of media deprived of EAAs or semi-EAAs, including Met/Cys, Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys, and His. As negative controls, cells were cultured in full medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and in a medium deprived of Ala, a non-essential AA. The expression of the transgene transcript was then evaluated by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 3, and in S3C and S4B Figs, most EAA-deficiencies induced reactivation of the OA1 or GFP transgenes in all four cell lines, with the notable exception of Trp deprivation, which consistently resulted in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes. Indeed, despite some variability, Met/Cys deficiency, but also Thr, Val, Tyr, and His deprivation always gave an efficient response, while Leu, Gln and Lys elicited evident responses in some cases, but not in others. Depletion of Phe gave results comparable to Tyr deprivation, however it significantly altered multiple reference genes used for normalization and therefore was eventually omitted from the analysis (not shown). Finally, in the above experiments we used a combined Met/Cys deficiency, to avoid the potential sparing of Met by Cys  and for consistency with our previous studies . Nevertheless, the analysis of single Met or Cys starvation, both at the protein and transcript levels, revealed an exclusive role of Met deprivation in transgene reactivation, consistent with the notion that Cys is not an EAA (S3D and S3E Fig).",
      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells. Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1–3 μM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4–16 mM), either alone or in combination for 24–48 h, compared to full medium. Mean ± SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post-test vs. full medium). PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 μM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively. Specifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown).",
      "Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 . These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic “parasites” anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming \"endogenized\" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements. HeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.",
      "Current address: Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. In a variety of species, reduced food intake, and in particular protein or amino acid (AA) restriction, extends lifespan and healthspan. However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK/ERK and/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease.",
      "We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, thus excluding that this kinase is necessary for the response to EAA starvation in HeLa-OA1 cells (Fig 6B and 6C). Fig 6. GCN2 knockout does not interfere with transgene reactivation in HeLa cells.

Since independent clones may display variable reactivation responses (e.g. due to different levels of transgene expression in basal conditions), the results are not shown as means of the three clones, but as separate replicates. Similarly, we generated GCN2-KO clones from the parental HepG2-OA1 cell line by the same strategy. By using a guide RNA against exon 1 of the GCN2 gene, we obtained three independent GCN2-KO clones, namely E23, F22 and F27. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone F27 (S7 Fig) and all three clones showed a very low amount—if any—of residual GCN2 protein, compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line (Fig 7A). To assess the ability of GCN2-KO cells to reactivate the transgene upon starvation, we cultured parental HepG2-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones in media deprived of Met/Cys or His (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3B) for 24 h, and evaluated the transgene expression by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 7B and 7C, we found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, as in HeLa cells."

      "A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline. Leave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children – and frequently other children across most of the developed world – have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen. This damning document is published simultaneously with a demand in the UK from the Royal Society for Public Health (which I had never heard of) to shut down comment about vaccines on the web.",
      "It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so. Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians. \"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day. And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen. What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again. \"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times?

But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing. Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk. Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs.",
      "If most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?

Hans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck! Here is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense. 1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?\n2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?\n3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it.",
      "And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again. If that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic. Plus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse. You did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments. And like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear. Like every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history. Many kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits. Our immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them. The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible."

Photo: Unknown/Norwegian Petroleum Museum\nA mere 17 months after the Ekofisk discovery was announced in December 1969, Gulftide was ready to come on stream as a temporary production platform. Its official inauguration took place on 9 June, with initial test output commencing on 15 June. Full production began on 8 July. The rig was chosen because it was available on the market. Established equipment for processing oil and gas was tailored to the limited space on board. Separate flowlines carried wellstreams from four subsea wells. Oil, gas and water were separated on board, with the gas flared and the oil piped to two buoys for loading into shuttle tankers. Work on the process equipment was relatively simple. The problem was to tailor it to the rig. The subsea wellheads had to be reinforced to meet the demands posed by the North Sea, and a buoy loading system needed to be developed for waters where this technology had never been used before. To gain time, it was decided that the three appraisal wells drilled by Ocean Viking to map the extent of the field – in addition to the discovery well – would be completed for production.

      "The problem with this approach arose when weather conditions meant the tankers had to cast off from the buoys because of strong winds or high waves. The rig then had to shut down production from the wellheads immediately. Given the weather conditions found on Ekofisk, output regularly had to cease. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason. Output began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day.

Oil and gas were produced by 2/4 A, B and C through their own wells for processing in their separation plants and piping on the 2/4 FTP for a three-stage separation process. At the same time, the tanker loading buoys were moved further from the platforms and the Ekofisk 2/4 T oil storage tank became operational.

      "As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee. As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated. In July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC). Born and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any. CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore.",

Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice.",
      "Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them. Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\" Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress. Born resigned on June 1, 1999. The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets. As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators. Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008. Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms. An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience."

      "Lute Olson confirmed it, saying he is not concerned about it. Shakur is hoping for an Orlando invite to show what he thinks he couldnt at Point Guard U.\nCedric Simmons, 6-9, PF/C, NC State Sophomore No First round pick? Simmons is reportedly \"exploring his options,\" in regards to the 2006 NBA draft, but will do so without an agent. Nice size, frame, length, athleticism and defensive skills make him a very intriguing prospect. Marcus Slaughter, 6-8, PF, San Diego State Junior Yes Second round pick? After burning his lone draft card a year early last June, despite being considered a marginal prospect, Slaughter has announced that he will be hiring agent Dan Fegan and forfeiting his remaining college eligibility. Slaughters father thinks that There was nothing else for Marcus to do at San Diego State. Many would disagree with that. Curtis Stinson, 6-3, PG/SG, Iowa State Junior Yes Second round pick After swearing up and down last month that he has no intention on entering the draft, Stinson did just that. His coach Wayne Morgan, who he was very close to, was fired, resulting in him hiring agent Kevin Bradbury. The 23 year old combo guard will have to go to the Orlando pre-draft camp and impress if he wants to come close to being a 1st rounder. Tyrus Thomas, 6-9, PF, LSU Freshman Yes Top 5 pick As DraftExpress exclusively reported Thomas called a press conference to announce his intentions to enter the 2006 NBA draft, as well as hire agents Brian Elfus and Mike Siegel. SEC Freshman of the year could be the most athletic player in the draft, as well as the player with the most overall upside. PJ Tucker, 6-5, SF, Texas Junior No Second round pick As reported all year long by DraftExpress, Tucker will be entering the draft without an agent. Considering that hes a 6-5 combo forward with tremendous skills, his stock widely fluctuates depending on who is being asked. Phenomenal basketball player, but is severely lacking in 2-3 inches of height. Will likely need a strong showing at the Orlando pre-draft camp to have a legitimate shot at the 1st round.",
      "Athletic and long, but still lacking any type of polish. Donald Jeffers, 6-8, PF, Roxbury Community College Sophomore No Undrafted Anonymous junior college player. Alexander Johnson, 6-9, PF, Florida State Junior Yes First round pick? Sources told DraftExpress, that Johnson will be hiring an agent, mainly because he is already 23 years old. Hes considered intriguing because of his strength, raw offensive tools and freakish athleticism at the 4 position, and could work his way into the 1st round with strong workouts. David Johnson, 6-7, PF, Clinton Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted 6-7 JUCO power forward who averaged 2 points and 3 rebounds per game. Trey Johnson, 6-5, SG, Jackson State Junior No Undrafted Small school prolific scorer and one of the most accurate perimeter shooters in the country will attempt to draw some more attention to himself by testing the waters this summer. Johnson is hoping for a chance to prove himself in the Orlando pre-draft camp in June. Coby Karl, 6-4, PG/SG, Boise State Junior No Undrafted Son of Denver Nuggets head Coach George Karl put up nice numbers (17 ppg, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 39.5% 3P) in the underrated WAC conference. Had surgery in March to remove a cancerous lump from his thyroid. Mark Konecny, 6-10, Center, Lambuth (NAIA) Junior No Undrafted Transfer from Syracuse with mediocre production is looking for any type of exposure he can get before he graduates next season. Kyle Lowry, 6-1, PG, Villanova Sophomore No First round pick NCAA tournament performance showed that he definitely needs another year, but regardless, Lowry is in. For now its without an agent. Considering the lack of quality point guard prospects in this draft, Lowry is likely a first round pick. Says he will attend the Orlando pre-draft camp if invited. Aleks Maric, 6-11, Center, Nebraska Sophomore No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Maric will be testing the waters. What may have played a role in this is the fact that the assistant coach that recruited him at Nebraska, Scott Spinelli, just moved on to Wichita State.",
      "Bobby Brown, 6-1, PG, Cal-State Fullerton Junior No First round pick? DraftExpress exclusively reported that Brown will be testing the waters. Still considered a bit of a sleeper because of the school he plays for, he will not be hiring an agent at this point. Some scouts are very high on his quickness and perimeter shooting ability and feel he will help his stock tremendously in private workouts. Shannon Brown, 6-4, SG, Michigan State Junior No First round pick? As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Brown will be testing the waters. He will likely conduct a number of workouts and attend the Orlando pre-draft camp to attempt and gauge where his stock lies. Scouts compare him to Celtic guard Tony Allen, but with a better attitude. Hes a very borderline first rounder in a draft that is stacked with shooting guards. Derek Burditt, 6-7, SG, Blinn Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted Unknown Junior College prospect. Not ranked as one of the top 25 JUCO players in the country, averaged around 17 points per game. Not burning his draft card as hes not yet an NCAA player, so really doesnt have much to lose, or gain. Leroy Dawson, 6-2, SG, Emporia State Junior No Undrafted Anonymous Division II player from the MIAA conference. 2nd team all conference, averaged 20 points per game. Like MANY on this list, only declaring because he can and has nothing to lose. Travis DeGroot, 6-4, SG, Delta State Junior No Undrafted Plays in a strong Division II conference, but is at best only the 3rd best prospect on his own team after Jasper Johnson and Jeremy Richardson, and is therefore not a prospect at all. Guillermo Diaz, 6-2, PG/SG, Miami Junior Yes First round pick? As reported by DraftExpress all year long, Diaz decided to forgo his senior year of college by hiring an agent, Miami based Jason Levien. One of the top athletes and shooters in the draft, which makes for an intriguing combination. Cem Dinc, 6-10, SF/PF, Indiana Freshman No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Dinc will be testing the waters.",
      "His stats are terrific, despite being the sole focal point of opposing defenses, and hes capable of scoring in a variety of ways, particularly with his jumper. Hes hoping for an invite to Orlando. Renaldo Balkman, 6-8, PF, South Carolina Junior No Undrafted After winning the NIT MVP award, Balkman has decided to see where he stands in the eyes of the NBA by testing the waters. Hes likely to find them downright freezing, as hes a skinny and undersized power forward with little to no skills who came off the bench for a very average team. Larry Blair,6-1, SG, Liberty Junior No Undrafted The 22 point per game scorer Blair is attempting to get some exposure for himself by testing the waters. Will Blalock, Iowa State, 5-11, PG, Junior No Second round pick? Declared for the draft together with Curtis_Stinson after Iowa States coach was fired. Size is a big question mark. Will likely hope to attend the pre-draft camp in Orlando and try to show scouts hes a 1st rounder. Likely returns for his senior year. Jahsha Bluntt, 6-6, SG, Deleware State Junior No Undrafted Puts up fairly average numbers (14.6 ppg, 41% FG) in one of the worst conferences in America. Looking for exposure at the Orlando pre-draft camp but its highly unlikely to receive it. Josh Boone, 6-10, PF/C, UConn Junior No First round pick? Boone announced hell be entering the draft without an agent. An up and down season has left his stock in the air, and will likely force him to prove himself at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Would greatly benefit from a productive senior season as an offensive focal point now that UConn has lost almost all of its firepower from last year. Ronnie Brewer, 6-6, PG/SG, Arkansas Junior No Lottery pick? After initially wavering a bit on his decision, Brewer announced hell be entering the draft without an agent in a press conference. Brewer is considered a likely late lottery pick to mid-first rounder pick, as his physical attributes and array of versatile skills on both ends of the floor are highly sought after.",
      "Pinnock will attempt to capitalize on his teams success this year by potentially attending the NBA pre-draft camp in Orlando. Pinnock will have to show better ball-handling and perimeter shooting ability than he did during the regular season. Leon Powe, 6-7, PF, Cal Sophomore No Second round pick Powe announced hell be testing the waters in a statement released by Cal. Where he ends up being projected depends heavily on how his knee checks out. Powe is already considered a serious tweener by NBA scouts, and had a hard time this season gaining back much of the explosiveness he had earlier in his career. Could realistically go undrafted should he decide to stay in. Richard Roby, 6-5, SG, Colorado Sophomore Likely Second round pick As first indicated by DraftExpress Roby has decided to test the waters. Disappeared against any major competition he went up against, particularly towards the end of the season. Roby will likely have to put on weight in the next few months and show off his perimeter stroke in the Orlando pre-draft camp. Sources tell us that he is on the verge of making a huge mistake by hiring an agent. Rajon Rondo, 6-2, PG, Kentucky Sophomore Yes First round pick As expected, Rondo has decided to enter the NBA draft, and has also hired an agent, Bill Duffy. Despite an inconsistent sophomore season, most scouts weve spoken to still had him as at least the #2 point guard on their board because of his intriguing upside. Workouts will be huge for him. Blake Schilb, 6-7, SG/SF, Loyola Chicago Junior No Undrafted Declared his intentions to enter the draft, without an agent, and is hoping for an invite to Orlando. Schlib is sorely lacking in the quickness and explosiveness departments that scouts demand from swingman prospects, but he makes up for it with his skill set to a certain extent. Regardless, sources tell us he wont be invited to Orlando, meaning he has to go back to school. Mustafa Shakur, 6-4, PG, Arizona Junior No Second round pick? According to the Arizona Star, Shakur will likely enter his name in the draft, without an agent."

      "Thalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nThalassaemia minor | definition of Thalassaemia minor by Medical dictionary\nhttps://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Thalassaemia+minor\n(redirected from Thalassaemia minor)\nRelated to Thalassaemia minor: thalassaemia major\nThalassemia describes a group of inherited disorders characterized by reduced or absent amounts of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red blood cells. There are two basic groups of thalassemia disorders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These conditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which can range from insignificant to life threatening. All types of thalassemias are considered quantitative diseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemoglobin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemoglobin is made up of three components: alpha globin, beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classified according to the globin that is affected, hence the names alpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of thalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and beta thalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Beta thalassemia may be the most best-known type of thalassemia and is also called Cooley's anemia. It is caused by a change in the gene for the beta globin component of hemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemia that can range from moderate to severe, depending in part on the exact genetic change underlying the disease. Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinical symptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe anemia that can occur within months after birth. If left untreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growth and development, as well as other common physical complications that can lead to a dramatically decreased life-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries beta thalassemia is usually identified by screening in the newborn period, before symptoms have developed. Children who are identified early can be started on ongoing blood transfusion therapy as needed.",
      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts.",
      "In recent years, there have been a handful of infants with this condition who have survived long-term. Most of these infants received experimental treatment including transfusions before birth, early delivery, and even bone marrow transplantation before birth, although the latter procedure has not yet been successful. For those infants that survive to delivery, there seems to be an increased risk of developmental problems and physical effects, particularly heart and genital malformations. Otherwise, their medical outlook is similar to a child with beta thalassemia major, with the important exception that ongoing, life-long blood transfusions begin right at birth. As discussed above, the prognosis for individuals with the most serious types of thalassemia has improved drastically in the last several years following recent medical advances in transfusion, chemo-, and transplantation therapy. Advances continue and promise to improve the life expectancy and quality of life further for affected individuals. \"First Known Heart Attack Associated With Beta-thalassemia Major Reported.\" Heart Disease Weekly February 22, 2004: 10. \"Novel Alpha-thalassemia Mutations Identified.\" Hematology Week January 26, 2004: 19.

      "The coach that recruited him and then never played him, Mike Davis, resigned, so it would not shock anyone to see Dinc return to play in Europe and become automatically eligible next year after pulling out of this years draft. Quincy Douby, 6-3, PG/SG, Rutgers Junior No First round pick As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Douby sent out his paperwork to enter the draft. NBA scouts are all over the board on him, with some saying they consider him a 2nd round pick and others saying they would not be surprised if he ended up in the lottery. Terrific shooter and shot creator, averaged 28 ppg in the Big East conference. A real sleeper who will likely play in Orlando. Mike Efevberha, 6-5, SG, Cal State Northridge Junior ??? Undrafted Ramona Shelburne of the LA Daily News reported that Efevberha will be testing the waters. Efevberha was the leading scorer in the country until he had a falling out with his coach and saw his playing time reduced significantly. Hell likely be looking for an invite to the Orlando pre-draft camp, and does not appear to be likely to head back to school. Carl Elliot, 6-4, PG, George Washington Junior No Undrafted Elliot is using his use it or lose it draft card as a junior to get some exposure for himself through workouts and try to figure out where he stands in the eyes of the NBA. Elliot has excellent size for the PG position, but is still lacking plenty of all-around polish. His senior year will be essential to his development as a player. Reportedly has a family to support, which makes his decision tough considering how old he is already, despite only being a junior. Jordan Farmar, 6-2, PG, UCLA Sophomore No First round pick? Farmar was the engine that led his team to the Finals of the NCAA tournament, and the only player that showed up once they got there. He is one of the top playmakers in the country, a Steve Nash type point guard, but his average athleticism, defense and outside shooting means hes only a bubble first-rounder. DraftExpress has been on his bandwagon since day one at UCLA, but is the NBA on it too?",
      "His stats are terrific, despite being the sole focal point of opposing defenses, and hes capable of scoring in a variety of ways, particularly with his jumper. Hes hoping for an invite to Orlando. Renaldo Balkman, 6-8, PF, South Carolina Junior No Undrafted After winning the NIT MVP award, Balkman has decided to see where he stands in the eyes of the NBA by testing the waters. Hes likely to find them downright freezing, as hes a skinny and undersized power forward with little to no skills who came off the bench for a very average team. Larry Blair,6-1, SG, Liberty Junior No Undrafted The 22 point per game scorer Blair is attempting to get some exposure for himself by testing the waters. Will Blalock, Iowa State, 5-11, PG, Junior No Second round pick? Declared for the draft together with Curtis_Stinson after Iowa States coach was fired. Size is a big question mark. Will likely hope to attend the pre-draft camp in Orlando and try to show scouts hes a 1st rounder. Likely returns for his senior year. Jahsha Bluntt, 6-6, SG, Deleware State Junior No Undrafted Puts up fairly average numbers (14.6 ppg, 41% FG) in one of the worst conferences in America. Looking for exposure at the Orlando pre-draft camp but its highly unlikely to receive it. Josh Boone, 6-10, PF/C, UConn Junior No First round pick? Boone announced hell be entering the draft without an agent. An up and down season has left his stock in the air, and will likely force him to prove himself at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Would greatly benefit from a productive senior season as an offensive focal point now that UConn has lost almost all of its firepower from last year. Ronnie Brewer, 6-6, PG/SG, Arkansas Junior No Lottery pick? After initially wavering a bit on his decision, Brewer announced hell be entering the draft without an agent in a press conference. Brewer is considered a likely late lottery pick to mid-first rounder pick, as his physical attributes and array of versatile skills on both ends of the floor are highly sought after.",
      "Bobby Brown, 6-1, PG, Cal-State Fullerton Junior No First round pick? DraftExpress exclusively reported that Brown will be testing the waters. Still considered a bit of a sleeper because of the school he plays for, he will not be hiring an agent at this point. Some scouts are very high on his quickness and perimeter shooting ability and feel he will help his stock tremendously in private workouts. Shannon Brown, 6-4, SG, Michigan State Junior No First round pick? As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Brown will be testing the waters. He will likely conduct a number of workouts and attend the Orlando pre-draft camp to attempt and gauge where his stock lies. Scouts compare him to Celtic guard Tony Allen, but with a better attitude. Hes a very borderline first rounder in a draft that is stacked with shooting guards. Derek Burditt, 6-7, SG, Blinn Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted Unknown Junior College prospect. Not ranked as one of the top 25 JUCO players in the country, averaged around 17 points per game. Not burning his draft card as hes not yet an NCAA player, so really doesnt have much to lose, or gain. Leroy Dawson, 6-2, SG, Emporia State Junior No Undrafted Anonymous Division II player from the MIAA conference. 2nd team all conference, averaged 20 points per game. Like MANY on this list, only declaring because he can and has nothing to lose. Travis DeGroot, 6-4, SG, Delta State Junior No Undrafted Plays in a strong Division II conference, but is at best only the 3rd best prospect on his own team after Jasper Johnson and Jeremy Richardson, and is therefore not a prospect at all. Guillermo Diaz, 6-2, PG/SG, Miami Junior Yes First round pick? As reported by DraftExpress all year long, Diaz decided to forgo his senior year of college by hiring an agent, Miami based Jason Levien. One of the top athletes and shooters in the draft, which makes for an intriguing combination. Cem Dinc, 6-10, SF/PF, Indiana Freshman No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Dinc will be testing the waters.",
      "Level of competition is mediocre in American semi-pro ABA league, which makes him an intriguing candidate for Orlando pre-draft camp. Ali Traore, 6-9, PF, Roanne 1985 France ??? Puts up nice numbers in France. Will participate at the Reebok Eurocamp in Treviso. Ejike Ugboaja, 6-8, PF, Union Bank Lagos 1985 Nigeria Undrafted Plays for Nigerian National Team. Goran Dragic, 6-4, PG, Geoplin Slovan 1986 Agent initially notified us that Dragic will be entering the draft, but in the end decided to keep him out. His buyout was always a question mark. Leigh Enobakhare, 6-10, Center, Oostende 1986 Agent Ugo Udezue from BDA Sports Management told us that Enobakhare will be entering the draft. In the end he must have heard that he is not considered a prospect at all, and decided to keep him out of the draft. Cartier Martin, 6-8, SF/PF, Kansas State Junior Martin pondered entering his name in the draft, especially after the firing of Kansas State coach Jim Wooldridge.\nNick Young, 6-6, SG, USC Sophomore Young told the LA Daily News in February that hes staying at USC for another year. D.J. Strawberry, 6-5, SG/SF, Maryland Junior Strawberry initially intended to test the waters, but eventually ended up not doing so once he found out that his chances of being drafted are almost non-existent. Al Thornton, 6-7, SF/PF, Florida State Sophomore Implied earlier on in the year that he might put his name in, but sources recently told us it appears that he will return for his senior year. Tallahassee media backs this up. Marcus Williams (AZ), 6-8, SG/SF, Arizona Freshman After initially appearing to be gone after numerous definitive reports, Williams surprised everyone and thrilled Arizona fans by announcing in a press conference hell be returning for his sophomore year. Josh McRoberts, 6-11, PF, Duke Freshman After being upset by LSU in the Sweet Sixteen, McRoberts was quoted saying Ill be at Duke next year..

The final single dimensional score represents machine learning based TS score.\n\\section{Physiological Sensor Signals Processing} The autonomic nervous system (ANS) restrains the body's physiological activities including the heart rate, skin gland secretion, blood pressure, and respiration. The ANS is divided into sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches. While SNS actuates the body's resources for action under arousal conditions, PNS attenuates the body to help regain the steady state. Mental arousal (say stress, anxiety etc.) activates the sweat gland causing the increment and reduction of  Skin Conductance on SNS and PNS physiological conditions respectively. However, Instant Heart Rate also has similar effect on SNS and PNS physiological condtions i.e., a higher value of heart rate is the effect of SNS and lower value is the outcome of PNS. EDA and PPG sensors are widely used to estimate the instant value of skin conductance and heart rate respectively \\cite{alam16}. \\subsection{EDA Sensor Signal Processing}\nEDA is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin which varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. There are three types of arousal: \\emph{cognitive, affective and physical}. \\emph{Cognitive} arousal occurs when a person tries to solve any problem using her cognitive ability. \\emph{Affective} arousal occurs when a person is worried, frightened or angry either doing daily activities or in resting position. On the other hand, \\emph{physical} arousal is related to the brain command to move bodily parts which is imposed on the total arousal as an artifact, called \\emph{motion artifact}. However, there are always some noises due to the weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and device motion.",
      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \\cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions.",
      "Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:\n\n{\\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. {\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition. {\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method. Then, we apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier \\cite{cao06} to classify final postural activity. Fig.~\\ref{fig:deconvolution} illustrates a single axis example of the deconvolution. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\n   \\epsfig{file=deconvolution.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Sample deconvolution example of X-axis.

      "Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults. \\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation} In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity."

      "In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years. In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood.

      "McPherson County (standard abbreviation: MP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson. History\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County. Peketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas."

      "He continued, “The stark truth is the sale of Plum Island is no longer necessary to build a new bioresearch facility because Congress has fully appropriated the funds. There is no need for this sale – and in fact, Congress needs to rescind the sale.” Congress, however, still has a law on the books that authorizes the sale of Plum Island land to the highest bidder. Therefore, opponents of the sale will have the burden of convincing Congress to change a law that is currently in place.

The potential for gypsy moth outbreak exists every year in our community. Dr. Kirby Stafford III, head of the Department of Entomology at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, has written a fact sheet on the gypsy moth available on the CAES website. The following information is from this fact sheet. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, was introduced into the US (Massachusetts) by Etienne Leopold Trouvelot in about 1860. The escaped larvae led to small outbreaks in the area in 1882, increasing rapidly. It was first detected in Connecticut in 1905. By 1952, it had spread to 169 towns. In 1981, 1.5 million acres were defoliated in Connecticut.",

(From Preserve Plum Island website)\nLast Thursday, March 24, at a press conference in Old Saybrook, a triumvirate of Congressional legislators from Connecticut, State Senator Richard Blumenthal and US Representatives Joe Courtney (D-2nd District) and Rosa DeLauro (D-3rd District) confirmed their support for a study to determine the future of Plum Island located in Long Island Sound. Members of the Plum Island Coalition — which has some 65 member organizations all dedicated to preserving the island — were in attendance to hear the good news. The island still houses a high-security, federal animal disease research facility, but the decision has already been taken to move the facility to a new location in Kansas with an opening slated for 2022. The current facility takes up only a small percentage of the land on the island and significantly for environmentalists, the remainder of the island has for years been left to nature in the wild. In supporting a federal study on the future of Plum Island, Sen. Blumenthal said, “This study is a step towards saving a precious, irreplaceable national treasure from developers and polluters. It will provide the science and fact-based evidence to make our case for stopping the current Congressional plan to sell Plum Island to the highest bidder.”",

For postural activity recognition, dataset achieving 91\\% postural activity recognition accuracy (FP rate 9.5\\%) which outperforms the baseline approach significantly (8\\% improvement).",
      "Now, we expand the postural activities for RCC datasets into 3 diverse `walking' postures: `normal walking', `walking with walker', `walking with single stick' and the accuracy goes down to 88\\% (FP 7.9\\%). Fig.~\\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_normal} and Fig.~\\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_extended} illustrate 4-class postural and extended 6-class postural classifier accuracies respectively which clearly posit that \\emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms in each case of postural activities as well as overall performances (8\\% and 7\\% improvement respectively).

      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \\cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions.",
      "We validate and compare \\emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets. \\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation} For collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent. The gender diversity in the recruited participants reflects the gender distribution (85\\% female and 15\\% male) in the retirement community facility. A trained gerontology graduate student evaluator completes surveys with participants to fill out the surveys. Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \\emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability. We follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode \\cite{hugo14}.",
      "Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:\n\n{\\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. {\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition. {\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method. Then, we apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier \\cite{cao06} to classify final postural activity. Fig.~\\ref{fig:deconvolution} illustrates a single axis example of the deconvolution. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\n   \\epsfig{file=deconvolution.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Sample deconvolution example of X-axis.

The competition sets up a target recognition track, a fixed-point grasping track, and an autonomous grasping track. The target recognition track concentrates on finding the {\\bf high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm which could be used in an underwater robot for automatically grasping. The datasets we used to generate the DUO are listed below. The detailed information has been shown in Table \\ref{Info}. {\\bf URPC2017}: It contains 17,655 images for training and 985 images for testing and the resolution of all the images is 720$\\times$405. All the images are taken from 6 videos at an interval of 10 frames. However, all the videos were filmed in an artificial simulated environment and pictures from the same video look almost identical. {\\bf URPC2018}: It contains 2,901 images for training and 800 images for testing and the resolutions of the images are 586$\\times$480, 704$\\times$576, 720$\\times$405, and 1,920$\\times$1,080.",
      "In terms of the content of the dataset images, there are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. URPC2017 only retains 15\\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance. For other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \\emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness. Therefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). Besides, based on the MMDetection$\\protect\\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \\cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \\emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER$\\protect\\footnote{JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA which could be deployed in an underwater robot."

      "Ørsted's slightly obscure words were that \"the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.\" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too. Ørsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere. This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained. Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.",
      "The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially. The first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes.",
      "For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines. Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed. Since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories."

      "Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history. In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu. History\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan. Yerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007. Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.",

It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand). Training centre/academy\nBanants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin. Fans\nThe most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district.

Dusan Sakota, 6-10, SF/PF, Panathinaikos 1986 Greece Undrafted Fairly unathletic perimeter oriented big man was in the draft last year already. Plays for one of the best teams in Europe and rarely sees the floor for meaningful minutes.

Important cog on an excellent team, but lacks athleticism and isnt as good of a shooter as you would hope at this point in his career. Saer Sene, 7-0, Center, Pepinster 1986? Senegal First round pick? Freakishly long and athletic African prospect who played extremely well at the Nike Hoop Summit. Many question his age and lack of productivity in the very average Belgian league A player teams will want to look at closely. Sidiki Sidibe, 7-1, Center, Levallois 1985 France ??? 7-1, 265 pound volleyball player and former Kansas State commit will be in this years draft according to his American agent. Too raw to get any playing time whatsoever in French 2nd division. Tiago Splitter, 7-0, PF/C, Tau Vitoria 1985 Brazil Lottery pick Splitters American agent Herb Rudoy told DraftExpress exclusively hes entering the draft Splitter is having a terrific season in both the ACB Spanish League and the Euroleague, but lack of buyout in his contract means he might not be able to stay in. CBA rules allow him to withdraw and become automatically eligible next season. Tau Vitorias president was quoted saying Splitter will be back in Spain next season.

Rudy Fernández, 6-5, SG, DKV Joventut 1985 Spain First round pick? Has some minor buyout issues to deal with to make sure he can stay in the draft. Excellent season in Spain has him projected as a pretty solid first round pick. Improved outside shooting, and still the same excellent athlete, passer, defender and all-around player hes always been. Still very skinny too. Kyrylo Fesenko, 6-11, PF, Azovmash 1986 Ukraine Second Round Pick More to come. Rafael Hettsheimeir, 6-9, Center, Akasvayu Girona 1986 Brazil Undrafted Undersized Brazilian center did not overly impress at the Nike Hoop Summit, showing that he will likely lack mobility until he takes off some weight. Marko Lekic, 6-11, PF, Atlas 1985 Serbia & Montenegro ??? American agent Marc Cornstein, Lekic told us hell be putting his name in the draft this year once again. Still a bit of an unknown, numbers are fairly average in the Serbian YUBA league. Damir Markota, 6-11, SF/PF, Cibona Zagreb 1985 Croatia Second round pick American agent Marc Cornstein told us Markota will definitely be putting his name in the draft once again. He had a breakout season in the Euroleague and Adriatic league before a groin injury slowed him down and eventually forced him to have minor surgery. Likely wont be able to come to the States until very late in the process. Does not have a buyout. Mickael Mokongo, 5-11, PG, Chalon 1986 France ??? DraftExpress was exclusively informed hell be in the draft. Considered a talented athlete, but lack of size and the fact that he missed a large chunk of the season due to injury means his draft stock is very much up in the air still. Brad Newley, 6-6, SG, 1985 Australia Second round pick Newely has told the Australian media that hes entering the draft. Hired Philadelphia based agent Leon Rose. Scouts who saw him play in Argentina last summer like his athleticism.",
      "Desperately lacking exposure, but agent appears to be unwilling to provide him with it. Oleksiy Pecherov, 6-11, PF, Racing Basket 1985 Ukraine Second round pick DraftExpress received indication that Pecherov will be entering his name in the draft after a nice 2nd half regular season in France. Pecherov has his draft card in hand one year before he becomes automatically eligible, meaning he has nothing to lose. Has some nice skills facing the basket, but is still very soft and underdeveloped. Hrvoje Peric, 6-8, SF, KK Split 1985 Croatia Second round pick? Good athlete who is still coming into his own as a basketball player. Did not play in the Adriatic League this season. Definitely needs at least another year in Europe, but could use the exposure that declaring for the draft provides. Kosta Perovic, 7-2, Center, Partizan 1985 Serbia & Montenegro Undrafted? DraftExpress has been told that Partizan needs Perovic to be drafted this year to relieve them of his 500,000$ salary next year as well as help them financially with buyout money for their budget. Unfortunately this is happening about 3 years too late as weve seen little to no improvement from Perovic over that span. Georgios Printezis, 6-9, PF, Olympiakos 1985 Greece Undrafted Greek power forward played 9 minutes and scored 4 points per game playing for a Euroleague team, and is declaring in hopes of getting his name out before he becomes automatically eligible next year. Milovan Rakovic, 6-10, PF, Atlas 1985 Serbia & Montenegro ??? American agent Marc Cornstein told us Rakovic will be putting his name in the draft. Still an unknown player, puts up nice numbers on occasion in the fairly weak Serbian YUBA league. Alexandr Rindin, 7-5, Center, Gala Baku 1985 Azerbaijan Undrafted Huge body, complete unknown. 5 points, 5 rebounds per game in FIBA Europe Cup. Sergio Rodríguez, 6-3, PG, Estudiantes 1986 Spain First round pick Rodríguezs agent in the States told DraftExpress exclusively hell be in the draft, likely for good if he gets a commitment in the 1st round."

I was diagnosed with it 9 years ago and the lack of awareness is frustrating. What a great resource for heart patients and their families! Thanks so much, Ashley. I recently updated my original 2011 list after the world-famous Cleveland Clinic tweeted their glossary recently and I noticed that their list had a few glaring omissions (like SCAD and Brugada Syndrome) so this made me wonder what my list might be missing, too. Let me know if there’s anything else you think should be included, okay?\nHow is your health these days? How are you feeling? New for me too. I have just been diagnosed with A-HCM: Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. I’ll add that one to my list, Kathleen – thanks! Just saw this, Carolyn, and you’ve compiled a great resource. One note on A-HCM: Present thinking is that it’s due to a genetic modification. Runs in families though sometimes occurs spontaneously. I have not as yet done genetic testing, though it’s been offered. Thanks Kathleen – like many cardiac diagnoses, it sounds like a moving target… Good luck to you! This list is great. I’ve just been diagnosed and am utterly overwhelmed. Even in the WomenHeart online support community, I often have no clue most days what others are talking about with all these initials about their heart tests and specific disease. This is VERY helpful, thank you SO MUCH. Love your website which has been a godsend since my diagnosis.",
      "There are many reasons for inverted T-waves, ranging from cardiac issues to completely benign conditions. One way of looking at this is choosing to believe that seeing a cardiologist will ease your mind one way or the other – so this is something to look forward to, not dread. If the cardiologist spots something suspicious, a treatment plan will be created. If not, you can wave goodbye and go back to happily living your life. Try thinking of this cardiology appointment just as you would if your car were making some frightening noises and you were bringing it to your mechanic for a check up. You could work yourself into a complete state worrying ahead of time if the car trouble is going to be serious, or you could look at this appointment as the solution – at last! – to figuring out what’s wrong so the mechanic can recommend the next step. Thank you for this list of so many definitions provided in plain English. what a valuable resource this is. THANK YOU, I have been looking for translations FOR PATIENTS not med school graduates– like this for three years. My family doctor had me wear a 24 hr EKG. After reading the results, she has scheduled a scope to look inside my heart by a specialist. Completely forgoing a stress test. Said I have major changes in the EKG, what type of changes could they be looking at? Had LAD STENT INSERTED 7 YRS AGO – WHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR? This is a great wealth of information, Carolyn! I looked and did not see my diagnosis, which is aortic stenosis. I looked under aortic as well as stenosis. Did I just miss it somehow? I learned some new information, I am a bit familiar now, but not when I had my MI, it was like learning a new language. But, my favorite part was seeing SCAD on this list! Thank you.\nThanks and welcome! I was thinking of editing that SCAD definition actually: I suspect that that it isn’t so much that SCAD is “rare”, but it’s more that it’s “rarely correctly diagnosed”. I totally agree that SCAD is not as rare as I believed for many years. Once awareness is spread to all medical staff, I believe many lives will be saved.",
      "I was so shocked. Wasn’t expecting that. She gave me a GNT (nitroglycerin) spray in case I do get pain and take 75Mg of aspirin. I’m now waiting for a Cardiology referral. I am so stressed and consumed by what might be wrong. My maternal grandmother had angina and valve issues. Her 3 brothers all had double bypasses. Could I have inherited this? I am not overweight at 63kg and 5.ft 9. I walk 20-25 miles a week at work and general walking here and there. I started HRT (patches evorol 25 -50) in July as menopause pain was making me feel like I was 90 and was getting me down. I am worried so much now and analysing every ache/ twinge I get. I feel like a hypochondriac at the moment. I’m worried what will happen at the cardiologist and what the test will entail and tell me. I am waiting on cholesterol test which I had on 25/01/19. Can I have inverted T waves and be fine. Please help I am so scared and crying far too much. Hello Colleen – the first thing is: please take a big deep breath before you read another word here! I’m not a physician so of course cannot comment on your specific case, but I can tell you generally that the definition of “angina” (as this glossary lists above) is “distressing symptoms”, typically chest pain that gets worse with exertion, and goes away with rest. That’s classic stable angina… typically caused by something that’s reducing blood flow to the heart muscle (causing the chest pain of angina). A family history that might make a difference for you personally is only in what’s called your ‘first degree’ relatives: for example, if your mother or sister were diagnosed with heart disease before age 65, or if your Dad or brother were diagnosed before age 55, then doctors would consider that you have a family history as a risk factor for heart disease. There’s little if any scientific evidence that a grandparent or uncle’s heart disease history has any effect on your own risk. It is a very good thing that you’re having further tests and a referral to a cardiologist, if only to ease your mind."

      "Some preachers try to draw out every possible implication while others see application as purely the Holy Spirit’s job and provide nothing. While there are many possible applications, I try to find one that the text emphasizes more than the others and make that the whole deal. So while I really wanted to say something in my last sermon about how we should love unconditionally just as God does, that wasn’t Paul’s application. It’s true and we should do it, but Paul’s application trumps mine because it’s his passage. So I talked about boasting in the Lord. Once I have my application, I take it in two directions—and I consider this my own secret sauce. I’m sure I’m not the first person to think of it, but I didn’t hear it anywhere else. My professor always told us “give them something to do!” In fact, he would say to give them something concrete to do that very day to maximize the chances that they will actually apply the sermon. I love it! It takes no time at all to forget a sermon. But then I discovered there are some who take issue with this entire method of application, among them one of my favorite preachers, Tim Keller. For them, giving people something to do inspires legalism, and that endangers the Gospel. Instead they strive to show how Jesus already fulfilled the command of this passage, and the application is just to believe in Him, to adore Him, to marvel at Him. I love this, too! I absolutely believe that every passage properly understood relates to Christ in some way, and every application can be used to point to His perfect example and finished work. So I try to do both. And here’s why: both are true. Christ has given us new life and yet we are called to live out a new life. The work is done in one sense, and yet we labor in another. So I always begin with showing how Christ has perfectly applied the passage and inviting people to believe in Him and rest in His finished work. Then because of what Christ has done, I call us to imitate Him by applying it ourselves. At this point all I have to show for my labor is a rough draft.",
      "If an idea gets me really excited, I’ll jump out of my seat and pretend I’m preaching on it right then and there. Often those bursts of inspiration have gems worth polishing. Hopefully by the end of the exegetical process and the theological Q&A, I have a list of ideas and phrases to sprinkle in as I actually write the sermon. One unfair advantage here is I took a course in copy writing, which is basically script for advertising. I especially liked what my professor called “fulcrum phrases,” like M&M’s famous “melts in your mouth / not in your hand.” It’s a skill I’ve tried to hone in my songwriting. If you can find that well-crafted phrase that has symmetry, it connects deeper and sticks better. I try to make sure I find at least one for every sermon. Here are some I’ve used:\nIt’s not yours to take; it’s God’s to give. He who walks in humility walks in grace. The fruit of your life reveals the tree of your heart. You don’t have to hold on to anything for God to hold on to you. So that’s my ideal, but I’m looking for anything at all that excites me, because if I’m excited about something there’s a good chance someone else will be, too. Sermon Structure At this point, I’m ready to start writing my sermon. I know what the text is about, why it exists, how it relates to the rest of Scripture, which parts are difficult to understand, and which parts are exciting. But before I can build content, I need a skeleton. At Dallas Seminary I learned that a good introduction has the same essential parts, and I use the acronym INSTeP to remember them: image, need, subject, text, and preview. As someone with some creative writing background, I didn’t like this at first. But truth be told, a good sermon borrows from both storytelling and essay. The story draws you in, but the essay keeps you grounded. And just like a good essay, you need a thesis statement and its essential supports to help prepare people for what’s to come. In my mind, the most important aspect of the introduction is the boring stuff: what’s the subject, what problem does it solve, where is our passage, and what are the main points.",
      "In short, the question raising and answering process is really the beginning of the theological phase for me. I’m looking for key ideas and trying to identify the timeless truths they communicate. Now there’s a danger here: you can use a passage to communicate all kinds of good theology. I think it’s much better when you can identify the theology the author was trying to communicate. So one could hypothetically use Jesus’ tree/fruit analogy to talk about order in creation or a theology of arboreal imagery—and I might even do that in a teaching context. But preaching is a different task to me. I believe preaching is exhorting with the authoritative words of God. I’m not up there to educate. I’m there to press the points I believe God is pressing. If I teach anything else, it’s on my own authority. Hopefully it’s right. But if I’m going to say “thus saith the Lord,” I’d better be a sure as I can be that this is really His point; because again, not all doctrines are equal. So that’s why in this example I preached that the fruit of your life reveals the tree of your heart. I’m confident that was Jesus’ point, not mine. Once I’m done with my exegetical studies, once I’ve done my best to figure everything out on my own—that’s when I turn to the commentaries. Just like with doing the translation, it’s not that I think I’m better than the experts; I do it because I know the text better when I wrestle with it myself. What’s more, as I wrestle with it I get a better sense of where others may have trouble, so I know to explain them more carefully or illustrate them more vividly. The only reason I even open the commentaries is for validation: did I miss anything or draw a wrong conclusion. Phase 3: Homiletical\nThroughout the whole process thus far, I’m keeping my eyes open for anything interesting, catchy, or eloquent. In some ways I’m having a conversation with the text and cross-references, and I note the parts of the conversation I like. If a crucial idea jumps out, I want to note it so I can craft a phrase around it.",
      "We have the Holy Spirit, but we still choose to disobey. In theory you should be able to live a perfect life after you’re saved, but because we’ve already been marked by sin in our lives and live in an imperfect world, we will never be perfect under our own power. What do we do then? Give up? Of course not! We beat our bodies into submission. We learn right and wrong from Scripture, and we challenge our motives day to day. But if we want to go the extra mile, we can’t do it alone. There will be times you trick yourself into thinking you’re doing what’s right. There will be times you misread Scripture and misunderstand what God expects. And to guard against those times you need to surround yourself with fellow believers. You need people who know you, who know the Word, and who are committed to following Jesus with you. They can provide that outside check to make sure sin isn’t getting the best of you. Because let’s face it: some days it’s hard to tell the difference between the Holy Spirit’s promptings and our own desires. Nothing can do better to counter that than other Spirit-filled people who bring a different perspective. We ended up talking a lot about sanctification today, but that’s because it’s how we cope with the effects of the Fall in our lives. I don’t ever want to teach about sin and suffering and death without also pointing to the hope we have in Christ! The sin we as Christians struggle with is our bad choices day to day. If you’re saved, all you can do is persevere in what’s right and help others to do the same. We’ll say more about suffering and death another time. My challenge to you is this: who do you have in your life who can give you that outside angle to your struggles and decisions? Where can you go to make sure you’re on the right path? If you’re not sure, start looking! We need each other more than ever. Isn’t it interesting how hard it is to remember the details of a story we’ve heard dozens of times? Our memories aren’t perfect. It sure helps having other people to lean on…\nHistorically speaking, the discussion of the effects of the Fall gets really fun with Augustine and Pelagius."

      "\\subsection{Penning ionization} The density distribution of a Rydberg gas defines a local mean nearest neighbour distance, or Wigner-Seitz radius of $ a_{ws} =  \\left(3/4 \\pi \\rho \\right)^{1/3} $, where $\\rho$ refers to the local Rydberg gas density. For example, a Rydberg gas with a density of $ \\rho_0=0.5 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3} $ forms an Erlang distribution \\cite{Torquato.1990} of nearest neighbour separations with a mean value of $ 2 a_{ws}=1.6$  $\\mu$m. A semi-classical model \\cite{Robicheaux05} suggests that 90 percent of Rydberg molecule pairs separated by a critical distance, $ r_c = 1.8 \\cdot 2 n_0^2 a_0 $ or less undergo Penning ionization within 800 Rydberg periods. We can integrate the Erlang distribution from $ r=0 $ to the critical distance $r = r_c$ for a Rydberg gas of given $n_0$, to define the local density of Penning electrons ($ \\rho_e$ at $t=0$) produced by this prompt interaction, for any given initial local density, $\\rho_0$ by the expression:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho_e(\\rho_0,n_0) = \\frac{0.9}{2} \\cdot 4 \\pi \\rho_0 ^2\\int_0^{r_{c}} r^2 \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\rho_0 r^3}\\mathrm{d}r \\quad.\n\\label{eqn: Erlang}\n\\end{equation}\n\nEvaluating this definite integral yields an equation in closed form that predicts the Penning electron density for any particular initial Rydberg density and principal quantum number. \\begin{equation}\n\\rho_e(\\rho_0,n_0) =\\frac{0.9 \\rho_0}{2}(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\rho_0 r_c^3}) \\quad.\n\\label{Eq:PenDens}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{Penning_Latice.pdf}\n\\caption{Distributions of ion-ion nearest neighbours following Penning ionization and electron-impact avalanche simulated for a predissociating molecular Rydberg gas of initial principal quantum number, $n_0$, from 30 to 80, and density of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$.

      "Coupled rate equations within each shell describe the avalanche to plasma. This rate process proceeds from shell to shell with successively longer induction periods, determined by the local density as detailed above. The rising conversion of Rydberg molecules to ions plus neutral dissociation products conserves the particle number in each shell. We assume that local space charge confines electrons to shells, conserving quasi-neutrality. Electrons exchange kinetic energy at the boundaries of each shell, which determines a single plasma electron temperature. \\begin{figure}[h!] \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= .5 \\textwidth]{shell_model_100}\n   \\caption{(top frame) Cross-sectional contour diagram in the $x,y$ plane for $z=0$ describing the distribution of ion plus electron density over 100 shells of Gaussian ellipsoid with initial dimensions, $\\sigma_x= 0.75$ mm and $\\sigma_y= \\sigma_z = 0.42$ mm and an initial $n_0 = 50$ Rydberg gas density, $\\rho_0 = 2 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{3}$ after an evolution time of 100 ns.

      "Avalanche times predicted by coupled rate equation calculations range widely.

Figure \\ref{fig:SFI} shows SFI spectra taken at a sequence of delays after the formation of $49f(2)$ Rydberg gases of varying density. Here, we can see that a $49f(2)$ Rydberg gas with an estimated initial density $\\rho_0 = 3 \\times 10^{11} ~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ relaxes to plasma on a timescale of about 500 ns. Observations such as these agree well with the predictions of coupled rate-equation calculations. We can understand this variation in relaxation dynamics with $\\rho_0$ and $n_0$ quite simply in terms of the corresponding density of prompt Penning electrons these conditions afford to initiate the avalanche to plasma.",
      "This causes mixing with core penetrating states that are strongly dissociative. Penning partners are thus very likely to dissociate, leaving a spatially isolated distribution of ions. We refer to the spatial correlation that results as a Penning lattice \\cite{Sadeghi:2014}. The extent of this effect varies depending on the local density and the selected initial principal quantum number. Figure \\ref{fig:PL} shows the degree to which Rydberg gases with initial principal quantum numbers from 30 to 80 form a Penning lattice for an initial density of $1 \\times 10^{12} ~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$.  \n\n\\subsection{Spontaneous electron-impact avalanche}\n\nThe electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization start an electron impact avalanche. The kinetics of this process are well described by a set of coupled rate equations that account for state-to-state electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering, electron-impact ionization and three-body ion-electron recombination \\cite{PPR,Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling} using detailed rate coefficients,  $k_{ij}$, $k_{i,ion}$ and $k_{i,tbr}$ validated by MD simulations \\cite{PVS}. \\begin{eqnarray}\n-\\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt}&=&\\sum_{j}{k_{ij}\\rho_e\\rho_i}-\\sum_{j}{k_{ji}\\rho_e\\rho_j} \\nonumber\\\\\n&& +k_{i,ion}\\rho_e\\rho_i-k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e \n  \\label{level_i}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\noindent and,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\rho_e}{dt}=\\sum_{i}{k_{i,ion}\\rho_e^2}-\\sum_{i}{k_{i,tbr}\\rho^3_e}\n  \\label{electron}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe relaxation of Rydberg molecules balances with collisional ionization to determine an evolving temperature of avalanche electrons to conserve total energy per unit volume. \\begin{equation}\nE_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2}k_BT_e(t)\\rho_e(t)-R\\sum_i{\\frac{\\rho_i(t)}{n_i^2}},\n  \\label{energy}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, for simplicity, we neglect the longer-time effects of Rydberg predissociation and electron-ion dissociative recombination \\cite{Saquet2012}. Such calculations show that the conversion from Rydberg gas to plasma occurs on a timescale determined largely by the local Penning electron density, or Penning fraction, $P_f = \\rho_e/\\rho_0$, which depends on the local density of Rydberg molecules and their initial principal quantum number."

U.S. Mail: Densmore Associates, inc. ANSI \"D\" size, computer generated plots of all the layout drawings in this series are available from the author for $30 plus postage & handling. Full (true size) scale plots may be made available depending on demand. \"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members. This scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base. First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door. In the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University.",
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch.",
      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads."

Since women don't know a thing about either and aren't interested in either, Terry had to find men who were 'experts. 'This is C.I.'s \" Iraq snapshot Friday, December 24, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Nouri's incomplete Cabinet continues to receive criticism, a father offers an 'excuse' for killing his own daughter, and more. Marci Stone (US Headlines Examiner) reports, \"Friday afternoon, Santa is currently in Baghdad, Iraq and on his next stop is Moscow, Russia, according to the 2010 NORAD Santa Tracker. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has been tracking Santa as he makes his annual journey throughout the world.\" Gerald Skoning (Palm Beach Post) quotes Santa saying, \"We send our special wishes for peace and goodwill to all. That includes the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.\" Please note that this is Santa's seventh trip to Iraq since the start of the Iraq War and, as usual, his journey was known in advance. No waiting until he hit the ground to announce he was going to Iraq -- the way George The Bully Boy Bush had to and the way US President Barack Obama still has to. In the lead up to Santa's yearly visit, many 'authorities' in Iraq began insisting that Christmas couldn't be celebrated publicly, that even Santa was banned. Gabriel Gatehouse (BBC News) quotes Shemmi Hanna stating, \"I wasn't hurt but I wish that I had been killed. I wish I had become a martyr for this church, but God kept me alive for my daughters.\" Shemmi Hanna was in Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad when it was assaulted October 31st and she lost her husband, her son, her daughter-in-law and her infant grandson in the attack. The October 31st attack marks the latest wave of violence targeting Iraqi Christians. The violence has led many to flee to northern Iraq (KRG) or to other countries. Zvi Bar'el (Haaretz) notes, \"This week the Iraqi legislature discussed the Christians' situation and passed a resolution in principle to help families who fled.",

It's always a man with Terry. Always. And somebody tell her that a snotty, snooty TV critic really doesn't make for good programming. This is C.I.'s \"Iraq snapshot:\" Thursday, December 23, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that \"war is not the answer.\" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, \"How is the war economy working for you?\"While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N. Environmental Sustainability Index on being most livable and greenest benefits. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead. The US military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent. Linda Pershing (Truthout) reports, \"Responding to a call from the leaders of Stop These Wars(1) - a new coalition of Veterans for Peace and other activists - participants came together in a large-scale performance of civil resistance.",
      "AP reports that Iraqi police sought out a 19-year-old woman because of rumors that she was working with al Qaida in Mesopotamia only to be greeted with the news that her father allegedly killed her and the father showed the police where he buried the woman . . . last month. The story begs for more than it offers. The most obvious observation is: what does it say that a woman's allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month? After that, it should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, \"his wife, two sons and a nephew\" -- as well as injuring four more people, and a Samarra roadside bombing which claimed the lives of 2 police officers. DPA notes it was two homes bombed in Haswa and that the Samarra roadside bombing also injured four Iraqi soldiers. Jomana Karadsheh (CNN) reports, \"Another policeman was wounded in Baghdad Friday night when a roadside bomb detonated by a police patrol, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.\"And we'll close with this from Peace Mom Cindy Sheehan's latest Al Jazeera column:The recent repeal of the US military policy of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" is far from being the human rights advancement some are touting it to be. I find it intellectually dishonest, in fact, illogical on any level to associate human rights with any military, let alone one that is currently dehumanising two populations as well as numerous other victims of it's clandestine \"security\" policies. Placing this major contention aside, the enactment of the bill might be an institutional step forward in the fight for \"equality\"; however institutions rarely reflect reality. Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military?While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot - as a peace activist - rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals in one of the least socially responsible organisations that currently exists on earth: The US military.",
      "Gallery owner Qasim Sabti states, \"We know it's fighting between the religious foolish man and the civilization man. We know we are fighting like Gandhi, and this is a new language in Iraqi life. We have no guns. We do not believe in this kind of fighting.\" Deborah Amos is the author of Eclipse of the Sunnis: Power, Exile, and Upheaval in the Middle East. Meanwhile Nizar Latif (The National) reports that distrust is a common reaction to the new government in Baghdad and quotes high school teacher Hussein Abed Mohammad stating, \"Promises were made that trustworthy, competent people would be ministers this time around, but it looks as if everything has just been divided out according to sectarian itnerests. No attention has been paid to forming a functioning government, it is just a political settlement of vested interests. I'm sure al Maliki will have the same problems in his next four years as he had in the last four years.\" Days away from the ten months mark, Nouri managed to finally end the stalemate. Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by \"A good year in Iraq.\" First up, meet the new Iraqi Body Count -- an organization that provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it and insist/slur \"Things aren't so bad!\" Sure enough, the editorial board of the Post does just that noting the laughable \"civilian deaths\" count at iCasualities. As we noted -- long, long before we walked away from that crap ass website, they're not doing a civilian count. They're noting how many deaths Reuters reports."

      "News stories and law enforcement focused on those “parking lot” states in Appalachia, where dealers and addicts with a tank of gas or a cheap plane ticket traveled the “Oxy Express” to Palm Beach and Broward. But Florida’s pill pipeline reached far beyond those roadways. By 2010, Florida was the oxycodone drug dealer of choice for drug users and dealers in the Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions as well as the Southeast, DEA records show, an area spanning virtually every state east of the Mississippi. It wasn’t just that Florida guaranteed a flow of cheap oxycodone. For 10 years, key lawmakers and agency heads repeatedly looked the other way as crooked doctors and bogus clinics flooded almost half the nation with the highly addictive drug. In failing to crack down, Florida extended by years the amount of time highly addictive oxycodone would be available to both first-time experimenters and addicts. It gave criminals the raw materials for trafficking. It gave Will Lockwood the OxyContin needed to feed his growing habit, It paved the way for his eventual jump to heroin. Jumping state lines\nTeenage high-school wrestling buddies in New Port Richey ran oxycodone into Tennessee; they were paid with cash hidden in teddy bears. A Hillsborough County man mailed 17,000 pills to Glen Fork, W.Va., a month’s supply for every man woman and child in the tiny town. A Boston Chinatown crime boss trafficked pills from Sunrise into Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Wellington twins and pill mill kingpins Paul and Phil George, brothers who oversaw one of the largest operations in the country from their five Palm Beach and Broward clinics, pushing oxycodone into Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and South Carolina. A husband and wife team operating out of a Forest Hill Boulevard clinic funneled pills to Delaware. At Palm Beach International Airport, two federal security agents accepted $500 a pop each time they waved through thousands of pillsbound for Connecticut and New York.",
      "A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy ‘pot of gold’\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida’s role in feeding the country’s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.",
      "Superior Pharmacy not only filled oxycodone prescriptions for pain clinics, it shared waiting room space with a pain clinic in a Temple Terrace strip mall outside Tampa. Neither Masters nor Superior had so much as Googled the background of pain clinic doctors writing those prescriptions, the DEA later said. Had they done so, the DEA dryly noted, they “would likely have come across a press release” announcing one of the doctors had been arrested and charged with trafficking in prescription drugs. Hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills were sent from Ohio distributors to Florida pharmacies. Unknown thousands of pills headed right back up to Ohio. When Ohio police burst into Christopher Thompson’s home outside Columbus, they found an assault rifle, $80,000 in cash and oxycodone from his Florida deals. A construction worker whose own pill habit started at age 14, Thompson oversaw a ring of 15 Ohio buyers who traveled to Florida to pick up oxycodone to resell in Central Ohio. Two hours to the west in Martin’s Ferry, David L. Kidd orchestrated a ring of buyers traveling to West Palm Beach and Central Florida to pick up oxycodone for resale on the streets of eastern Ohio and West Virginia. Doctors and pharmacies from Florida were complicit with Kidd’s ring in fueling Ohio’s opioid epidemic, wrote the U.S. attorney for West Virginia after Kidd’s 2011 arrest: “The steady flow of pain pills into the Ohio Valley from Florida must stop.” Driving To Pick Up Death By Rx\nWith more drugs came more deaths, in January 2010, say police, Fort Lauderdale pathologist Dr. Lynn Averill started a seven-month oxycodone shopping spree, buying 437,880 oxycodone pills from drug distributors. The same month, Matthew Koutouzis drove from Toms River, N.J., to see Averill in her Broward County pain clinic. The 26-year-old collected prescriptions for 390 pills and overdosed two days later. Brian Moore traveled 13 hours from his Laurel County, Ky., home to see Averill. He left with prescriptions for 600 pills and also overdosed within 48 hours."

      "Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little. In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact. At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation. On 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. Opposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017.",
      "First period in cabinet (1996–1999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters. As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted. By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed."

      "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement. Plot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty. One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed.",
      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government."

      "We remark that the intervals between the different states do not need to be uniformly spaced. Autoencoder\n\nA core assumption of the method is that each high-dimensional state x n can be compressed to a lower-dimensional representation z n ∈ C c with c << f . We identify this lower-dimensional representation by an autoencoder consisiting of a parameterized encoder and decoder. The encoder maps the high-dimensional representation to the latent space as:\nThe latent space is complex-valued. The decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional representation based on the latent variables as: We denote the parameters of the encoder as well as the decoder by θ. As discussed later in Section II C, both set of parameters are optimized simultaneously during training and therefore there is no need for differentiating them. Interpretable Latent Space Dynamics\n\nWe employ a propagator in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics of the system. In contrast to other time-extended variational autoencoder frameworks, our representation uses complex valued latent variables. In addition the latent variables are treated independently. The latter feature enables us to have an interpretable latent dynamics as well as a model that is especially suitable for being trained in the Small Data regime due to the small number of required parameters. This is in contrast to temporal propagators such as LSTMs . For each dimension i of the latent variable z we are using the following continuous ODE in the complex plane: By solving this ODE, we can define the operator: Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation Here, λ is a vector containing all the individual λ's and ∆t n indicates the time-step between the latent states. The symbol is used to indicate a component-wise multiplication. We remark that the latent variables and the parameter governing the temporal evolution are complex numbers and their role in describing the system dynamics is similar to that of an eigenvalue. The real part is associated with growth and decay whereas the imaginary part is representing the periodic component.",
      "The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis . This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II. Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation. We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n ∈ R f with n = 1, ..., T .",
      "This approach has similarities with the Koopman-operator based methods and the extended dynamic mode decomposition . In contrast to the methods mentioned before we are using a continuous formulation in the latent space that allows us to incorporate scarce and irregularly sampled training data and directly rely on complex numbers in the latent space. Training and Predictions\n\nWe optimize a loss function that combines both a reconstruction loss as well as a loss associated with the error of our learned propagator in the latent space: (5) We note that we could directly incorporate mini-batch training by only taking the summation over a subset of the N available training data. For new predictions of unseen states, we use the encoder to generate a latent representations which is then advanced in time by the learned propagator. At a designated time step we are using the decoder to reconstruct the high-dimensional solution. We applied our algorithm to three systems. First, we show that the algorithm is capable of exactly reproducing the solution of a linear ODE and to identify its eigenvalues. Afterwards we are applying the framework to a high-dimensional process generated by a complex latent dynamics, which is correctly identified. As a final test case, we are applying the algorithm to a Kuramoto Shivashinski (KS) equation. Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation\n\nLinear ODE\n\nWe are considering a two-dimensional ODE system for x = y 1 y 2 : Based on the obtained training data we run our algorithm using a linear encoder and decoder structure as well as two latent variables z. The loss function was optimized using the Adam algorithm . As we consider a linear ODE we can analytically compute the eigenvalues involved and compare it with the parameters λ identified by our algorithm. We observe in Figure that the algorithm was able to recover the correct values, i.e. the eigenvalues 7 and 3 of the given linear ODE. The system does not have a periodic component and the two imaginary parts correctly go to zero, whereas the real parts converge to the reference value."

      "The body attempts to compensate by producing more blood, which is made inside the bones in the marrow. However, this is ineffective without the needed genetic instructions to make enough functioning hemoglobin. Instead, obvious bone expansion and changes occur that cause characteristic facial and other changes in appearance, as well as increased risk of fractures. Severe anemia taxes other organs in the body—such as the heart, spleen, and liver—which must work harder than usual. This can lead to heart failure, as well as enlargement and other problems of the liver and spleen. When untreated, beta thalassemia major generally results in childhood death, usually due to heart failure. In 2004, the first known heart attack associated with beta thalassemia major was reported. Fortunately, in developed countries diagnosis is usually made early, often before symptoms have begun. This allows for treatment with blood transfusion therapy, which can prevent most of the complications of the severe anemia caused by beta thalassemia major. Individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia have a more moderate anemia that may only require treatment with transfusion intermittently, such as when infections occur and stress the body. As a person with beta thalassemia intermedia gets older, however, the need for blood transfusions may increase to the point that they are required on a regular basis. When this occurs their disease becomes more similar to beta thalassemia major. Other genetic and environmental factors can influence the course of the disease as well. For example, co-inheritance of one or two alpha thalassemia mutations can tend to ameliorate some of the symptoms of beta thalassemia disease, which result in part from an imbalance in the amount of alpha- and beta-globin present in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin h disease\nAbsence of three alpha globin genes causes an imbalance of alpha and beta globin proteins in the red blood cells. The excess beta globin proteins tend to come together to form hemoglobin H, which is unable to release oxygen to the tissues.",
      "Although transfusion therapy prevents many of the complications of severe anemia, the body is unable to eliminate the excess iron contained in the transfused blood. Over time, the excess iron deposits in tissues and organs, resulting in damage and organ failure. Another medication must be administered to help the body eliminate the excess iron and prevent iron-over-load complications. Beta thalassemia intermedia describes the disease in individuals who have moderate anemia that only requires blood transfusions intermittently, if at all. Alpha thalassemia is the result of changes in the genes for the alpha globin component of hemoglobin. There are two main types of alpha thalassemia disease: hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major. The two diseases are quite different from beta thalassemia as well as from one another. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease can experience events of hemolytic anemia—anemia caused by the rapid breakdown of the red blood cells. These events are thought to be triggered by various environmental causes, such as infection and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Hemoglobin H disease is in most cases milder than beta thalassemia. It does not generally require transfusion therapy. Alpha thalassemia major is a very serious disease that results in severe anemia that begins even before birth. Most affected babies do not survive to be born or die shortly after birth. The thalassemias are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Both alpha and beta thalassemia have been described in individuals of almost every ancestry, but the conditions are more common among certain ethnic groups. Unaffected carriers of all types of thalassemia traits do not experience health problems. In fact, the thalassemia trait is protective against malaria, a disease caused by blood-borne parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. According to a widely accepted theory, most genetic changes—mutations—that cause thalassemia occurred multiple generations ago. Coincidentally, these mutations increased the likelihood that carriers would survive malaria infection.",
      "In addition, hemoglobin H tends to precipitate out in the cells, causing damage to the red blood cell membrane. When affected individuals are exposed to certain drugs and chemicals known to make the membrane more fragile, the cells are thought to become vulnerable to breakdown in large numbers, a complication called hemolytic anemia. Fever and infection are also considered to be triggers of hemolytic anemia in hemoglobin H disease. This can result in fatigue, paleness, and a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of eyes called jaundice. Usually, the anemia is mild enough not to require treatment. Severe anemia events may require blood transfusion, however, and are usually accompanied by such other symptoms as dark feces or urine and abdominal or back pain. These events are uncommon in hemoglobin H disease, although they occur more frequently in a more serious type of hemoglobin H disease called hemoglobin H/Constant Spring disease. Individuals effected with this type of hemoglobin H disease are also more likely to have enlargement of and other problems with the spleen. Alpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha globin is a necessary component of all major hemoglobins and some minor hemoglobins, absence of all functioning alpha globin genes leads to serious medical consequences that begin even before birth. Affected fetuses develop severe anemia as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta, heart, liver, spleen, and adrenal glands may all become enlarged. Fluid can begin collecting throughout the body as early as the start of the second trimester, causing damage to developing tissues and organs. Growth retardation is also common. Affected fetuses usually miscarry or die shortly after birth. In addition, women carrying affected fetuses are at increased risk of developing complications of pregnancy and delivery. Up to 80% of such women develop toxemia, a disturbance of metabolism that can potentially lead to convulsions and coma. Other maternal complications include premature delivery and increased rates of delivery by cesarean section, as well as hemorrhage after delivery.",
      "For those with the hemoglobin H/Constant Spring form of the disease, the need for transfusions may be intermittent or ongoing, perhaps on a monthly basis and requiring desferoxamine treatment. Individuals with this more severe form of the disease may also have an increased chance of requiring removal of an enlarged and/or overactive spleen. Anemia — A blood condition in which the level of hemoglobin or the number of red blood cells falls below normal values. Common symptoms include paleness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Bilirubin — A yellow pigment that is the end result of hemoglobin breakdown. This pigment is metabolized in the liver and excreted from the body through the bile. Bloodstream levels are normally low; however, extensive red cell destruction leads to excessive bilirubin formation and jaundice. Bone marrow — A spongy tissue located in the hollow centers of certain bones, such as the skull and hip bones. Bone marrow is the site of blood cell generation. Bone marrow transplantation — A medical procedure used to treat some diseases that arise from defective blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Healthy bone marrow is extracted from a donor to replace the marrow in an ailing individual. Proteins on the surface of bone marrow cells must be identical or very closely matched between a donor and the recipient. Desferoxamine — The primary drug used in iron chelation therapy. It aids in counteracting the life-threatening buildup of iron in the body associated with long-term blood transfusions. Globin — One of the component protein molecules found in hemoglobin. Normal adult hemoglobin has a pair each of alpha-globin and beta-globin molecules. Heme — The iron-containing molecule in hemoglobin that serves as the site for oxygen binding. Hemoglobin — Protein-iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells and carries carbon dioxide away from the cells. Hemoglobin A — Normal adult hemoglobin that contains a heme molecule, two alpha-globin molecules, and two beta-globin molecules.",
      "Although blood supplies in the United States are very safe, particularly relative to the past and to other areas of the world, there remains an increased risk of exposure to such blood-borne infections as hepatitis. Additionally, the body is not able to get rid of the excess iron that accompanies each transfusion. An additional medication called desferoxamine is administered, usually five nights per week over a period of several hours, using an automatic pump that can be used during sleep or taken anywhere the person goes. This medication is able to bind to the excess iron, which can then be eliminated through urine. If desferoxamine is not used regularly or is unavailable, iron overload can develop and cause tissue damage and organ damage and failure. The heart, liver, and endocrine organs are particularly vulnerable. Desferoxamine itself may rarely produce allergic or toxic side effects, including hearing damage. Signs of desferoxamine toxicity are screened for and generally develop in individuals who overuse the medication when body iron levels are sufficiently low. Overall, however, transfusion and desferoxamine therapy have increased the life expectancy of individuals with the most severe types of beta thalassemia major to the 4th or 5th decade. This can be expected to improve with time and increased developments in treatment, as well as for those with more mild forms of the disease. New treatments offer additional options for some individuals with beta thalassemia major. There are various medications that target the production of red blood cells (i.e. erythropoeitin) or fetal hemoglobin (i.e. hydroxyurea and butyrate). Their effectiveness in ameliorating the severity of beta thalassemia is currently being investigated. Another promising new treatment is bone marrow transplantation, in which the bone marrow of an affected individual is replaced with the bone marrow of an unaffected donor. If successful, this treatment can provide a cure. However, there is an approximately 10-15% chance the procedure could be unsuccessful (i.e. the thalassemia returns); result in complications (i.e. graft-versus-host disease); or result in death."

      "The neural responses are preprocessed to the form of average firing rate and can be downloaded from Brain-Score. Since the core visual function of macaque and mouse visual cortex is to recognize objects, the basic premise of model selection is that the model has good performance on object recognition tasks (e.g.\nclassification on ImageNet). Based on this premise, we employ 12 SNNs, 43 CNNs, and 26 vision transformers, all of which are pretrained on the Ima-geNet dataset and perform well in the classification task. As for SNNs, we use SEW ResNet as the base model, which is the deepest and SOTA directly trained SNN . Furthermore, by combining the residual block used in SEW ResNet and the hierarchy of the visual cortex, we build several new SNNs and train them on the ImageNet using SpikingJelly ) (see Appendix A for model structures and the details of model training). As for CNNs and vision transformers, we use 44 models from the Torchvision model zoo , 22 models from the Timm model zoo ) and 3 models from the brain-like CNNs, CORnet family ). In the feature extraction procedures of all models, we feed the same set of images used in biological experiments to the pretrained models and obtain features from all chosen layers. Different from CNNs and vision transformers, the features of SNNs are spikes in multiple time steps. To obtain the representation similarity between biological visual cortex and computational models, we apply three similarity metrics to computing similarity scores: representational similarity analysis (RSA) , regression-based encoding method and singular vector canonical correlation analysis (SVCCA) . RSA has already been widely used to analyze neural representations of a model and a brain to different stimuli at the population level, while the regression-based encoding method directly fits the model features to neural activity data. SVCCA is originally proposed to compare features of deep neural networks, and then Buice 2019) used it to compare representation matrices from mouse visual cortex and DNNs, which demonstrated its effectiveness.",
      "Our codes and appendix are available at https://github.com/Grasshlw/SNN-Neural-Similarity. There are plenty of computational models of macaque and mouse visual systems for exploring the visual processing mechanisms recently. We summarize some of the outstanding work in the following. The network models of macaque visual system. In the early days, studies basically used simple feedforward neural networks as the models of the macaque visual system (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . Recently, some bio-inspired or more complex models achieved better performance in fitting the neural representations of macaque visual cortex . proposed a brainlike shallow CNN with recurrent connections to better match the macaque ventral visual stream. By mimicking the primary stage of the primate visual system, VOneNets ) performed more robustly in image recognition while better simulating macaque V1. Moreover, the representations learned by unsupervised neural networks ) also effectively matched the neural activity of macaque ventral visual stream. Although the above work developed many bio-inspired structures, the networks are still traditional ANNs in nature. Our work introduces deep SNNs for the first time to explore the visual processing mechanisms of macaque visual system. The network models of mouse visual system. Largescale mouse neural dataset provided an experimental basis for model studies of mouse visual system (de Vries et al. 2020; . conducted comparisons between the representations of mouse visual cortex and the VGG16 trained on the Im-ageNet dataset. In , they developed a single neural network to model both the dorsal and ventral pathways with showing the functional specializations. What's more, a large survey of advanced deep networks ) revealed some hierarchy and functional properties of mice. Similar to the studies of macaque visual system, deep SNNs have never been used to model the mouse visual system. In this work, we not only use SNNs as one of the candidates to fit the representations of mouse visual cortex, but also conduct direct comparisons between macaques and mice to further investigate the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the two species.",
      "Depths of the layers with the highest similarity scores exhibit little differences across mouse cortical regions, but vary significantly across macaque regions, suggesting that the visual processing structure of mice is more regionally homogeneous than that of macaques. Besides, the multi-branch structures observed in some top mouse brain-like neural networks provide computational evidence of parallel processing streams in mice, and the different performance in fitting macaque neural representations under different stimuli exhibits the functional specialization of information processing in macaques. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. Originally, the prototype of deep neural networks is inspired by the biological vision system . To date, deep neural networks not only occupy an unassailable position in the field of computer vision , but also become better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014; . They have been successful at predicting the neural responses in primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of ventral visual stream (Güc ¸lü and van Gerven 2015; , and even controlling neural activity . Moreover, as training paradigms of mice and techniques for collecting neural activity (de Vries et al. 2020) have been greatly improved, there is a strong interest in exploring mouse visual cortex. Deep neural networks also play an important role in revealing the functional mechanisms and structures of mouse visual cortex . Compared to biological networks, Artificial Neural Networks discard the complexity of neurons . Spiking Neural Networks, incorporating the concept of time and spikes, are more biologically plausible models . To be more specific, because of their capabilities of encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features, deep SNNs are highly possible to yield brain-like representations ).",
      "In fact, some studies using multiple pathways simulate the functions of mouse visual cortex to some extent . Our results further suggest that not only the mouse visual cortex might be an organization of parallel structures, but also there are extensive parallel information processing streams between each pair of cortical regions . For the two macaque datasets with different stimuli, not only are the model rankings significantly different, but also the correlations between the similarity scores and the model depth are totally opposite. These results corroborate the following two processing mechanisms in macaques: the ventral visual stream of primate visual cortex possesses canonical coding principles at different stages; the brain exhibits a high degree of functional specialization, such as the visual recognition of faces and other objects, which is reflected in the different neural responses of the corresponding region (although the face patch AM is a sub-network of IT, they differ in the neural representations). Besides, as shown in Figure , The calculation and plotting of the trajectories are the same as Figure . the similarity scores of vision transformers reach the maximum in the early layers and then decrease. Differently, the scores of CNNs and SNNs keep trending upwards, reaching the maximum in almost the last layer. On the other hand, Appendix C shows that vision transformers perform well in Macaque-Face dataset but poorly in Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Considering the features extraction mechanism of vision transformers, it divides the image into several patches and encodes each patch as well as their internal relation by self-attention. This mechanism is effective for face images that are full of useful information. However, the synthetic image consists of a central target object and a naturalistic background. When vision transformers are fed with this type of stimuli, premature integration of global information can lead to model representations containing noise from the unrelated background.",
      "However, deep SNNs have not been employed to model visual cortex due to the immaturity of training algorithms. Recently, a state-ofthe-art directly trained deep SNN , makes it possible to use deep SNNs as visual cortex models. Contributions. In this work, we conduct large-scale neural representation similarity experiments on SNNs and other high-performing deep neural networks to study the brain's visual processing mechanisms, with three datasets and three similarity metrics (Figure ). Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use deep SNNs to fit complex biological neural representations and explore the biological visual cortex. We summarize our main contributions in four points as follows. • We find that SNNs outperform their counterparts of CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures in almost all experiments. In addition, even with very different depths and architectures, SNNs can achieve top performance in most conditions. • By making a more direct comparison between macaques and mice for the first time, we reveal the differences in the visual pathways across the two species in terms of the homogeneity of visual regions and the increases of receptive field sizes across cortical visual pathways, which is consistent with previous physiological work. • The multi-branch structures in neural networks benefit neural representation similarity to mouse visual cortex, providing computational evidence that parallel information processing streams are widespread between cortical regions in the mouse visual system. • Comparing the results of two macaque neural datasets under different stimuli, we reveal that the macaque vision system may have functional specialization for processing human faces and other natural scenes. Altogether, as the first work to apply deep SNNs to fit neural representations, we shed light on visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice, demonstrating the potential of SNNs as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system."

      "It is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. Even then I'm sure plenty fitting that description have faced the terror and torment enshrined into an institution that transforms the pride and enthusiasm of youth into a narrow zeal for dominating power relations. And we'll close with this from Francis A. Boyle's \"2011: Prospects for Humanity?\" (Global Research):Historically, this latest eruption of American militarism at the start of the 21st Century is akin to that of America opening the 20th Century by means of the U.S.-instigated Spanish-American War in 1898. Then the Republican administration of President William McKinley stole their colonial empire from Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; inflicted a near genocidal war against the Filipino people; while at the same time illegally annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii and subjecting the Native Hawaiian people (who call themselves the Kanaka Maoli) to near genocidal conditions. Additionally, McKinley's military and colonial expansion into the Pacific was also designed to secure America's economic exploitation of China pursuant to the euphemistic rubric of the \"open door\" policy. But over the next four decades America's aggressive presence, policies, and practices in the \"Pacific\" would ineluctably pave the way for Japan's attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 194l, and thus America's precipitation into the ongoing Second World War. Today a century later the serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III. By shamelessly exploiting the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001, the Bush Jr. administration set forth to steal a hydrocarbon empire from the Muslim states and peoples living in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf under the bogus pretexts of (1) fighting a war against international terrorism; and/or (2) eliminating weapons of mass destruction; and/or (3) the promotion of democracy; and/or (4) self-styled \"humanitarian intervention.\"",
      "Only this time the geopolitical stakes are infinitely greater than they were a century ago: control and domination of two-thirds of the world's hydrocarbon resources and thus the very fundament and energizer of the global economic system – oil and gas. The Bush Jr./ Obama administrations have already targeted the remaining hydrocarbon reserves of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia for further conquest or domination, together with the strategic choke-points at sea and on land required for their transportation. In this regard, the Bush Jr. administration announced the establishment of the U.S. Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM) in order to better control, dominate, and exploit both the natural resources and the variegated peoples of the continent of Africa, the very cradle of our human species. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated \"unlimited imperialism\" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all have in common an urge toward expansion which knows no rational limits, feeds on its own successes and, if not stopped by a superior force, will go on to the confines of the political world. This urge will not be satisfied so long as there remains anywhere a possible object of domination--a politically organized group of men which by its very independence challenges the conqueror's lust for power. It is, as we shall see, exactly the lack of moderation, the aspiration to conquer all that lends itself to conquest, characteristic of unlimited imperialism, which in the past has been the undoing of the imperialistic policies of this kind…. On 10 November 1979 I visited with Hans Morgenthau at his home in Manhattan. It proved to be our last conversation before he died on 19 July 1980. Given his weakened physical but not mental condition and his serious heart problem, at the end of our necessarily abbreviated one-hour meeting I purposefully asked him what he thought about the future of international relations.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private."

On hearing such Manqabats he would say, \"I am not worthy of such praise. May Allah make me worthy. \"\nMany people came to him for his blessings. Others would come for Ta'weez. He never refused anyone. It is also not known how many homes were being supported through the kindness and hospitality of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). He always entertained those who came from far and near to the best of his means. He used to even give most of his visitors train and bus fares to travel. In winter, he would give warm clothes, warm sheets and blankets to the poor and the needy. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave Khilafat to many Ulema-e-Ikraam and personally tied the Amaama (Turban) on their heads. He gave cloaks, turbans and hats to many people. Once, during winter, a few of the Khaadims were present with Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He was lying on his bed and covered with a shawl. A certain Maulana Abu Sufyaan touched Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) shawl and commented as to how beautiful it was.

Many questions on Tassawuf were easily answered by him. It seemed as if the rains of mercy and rays of Noor were spread all over his Mehfils. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always wanted to see a Muslim's inner and outer personality. He always advised them to mould their lives according to the principles and the commands of Islam. He always showed discomfort to those who did not have beards, those who wore hats and to those who wore ultra-western clothes. He used to warn such Muslims.",
      "His character was the true embodiment of the Sunnah of Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He shone like a star in the darkness of the night. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) possessed great heights of good character, moral standards, kindness, sincerity, love and humbleness. He never refused the invitation of any poor Muslim. He always stayed away from those who were very wealthy and lavish. He was the possessor of great moral and ethical values. It is stated that once Akbar Ali Khan, a Governor of U.P., came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) did not meet him but left to a place called Puraana Shahar (Old City) to visit a poor Sunni Muslim who was very ill and at the doorstep of death. In another occasion, Fakhruddeen Ali Ahmad, the President of a Political Party, came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but was refused this opportunity. Many other proud ministers had also come to meet Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but met with the same fate. This was due to his extreme dislike for politics and involvement in worldly affairs. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) never fell short in entertaining those who came to visit him. When he was physically fit he used go into the Visitors Section and ask each person whether they had eaten or not. He used to ask them if they partook in tea or not. He used to continuously enquire as to whether they were experiencing any difficulties or not. It was often seen that he would personally carry the dishes into the house for the visitors! He was definitely blessed with the characters of the \"Salfe Saliheen\" or The Pious Servants of Allah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a pillar of hospitality and humbleness. If he reprimanded a certain person for doing something un-Islamic or if he became displeased with anyone for some reason or the other, he used to also explain to the person in a very nice way and also try to cheer that person.",
      "When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior. \"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality. Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind\" but he was also known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam\" or The Grand Mufti of the World.",

He also showed great respect towards Sayyidi Hafiz-e-Millat and Hazrat Maulana Hasmat Ali Khan Sahib (radi Allahu anhum). He also showed respect towards his own Mureeds and Khalifas who were Alims. \"Hawa he Gotand wa Tez lekin Chiraagh Apna Jala Raha he, Wo Marde Durwesh jis ko Haq ne diye the Andaze Khusrawana\"\nThe sign of a true Mo'min is that he never submits himself before an enemy. In the worst of circumstances a Mo'min announces that which is the truth. Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said, \"To speak the truth before a tyrant King is a great Jihad.\" So imagine the excellence of a person who always spoke the truth at all times, a person who always raised the flag of truth and honesty, and a person who never left the path of truth in his entire life! Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was one such person. He is one of the greatest leaders of the Sunnis. His boldness and fearlessness is difficult to explain. His entire life was spent speaking against Deobandis, Wahabis and all the other misleading sects, whether is was against the West, Qadianism, or Najdism he always challenged them right till the very end. He always propagated the true Deen and the Path of the Ahle Sunnah Wa Jamaah. With his Fatawas, he helped protect the Imaan of not only the Muslims in India and Pakistan, but of Muslims throughout the world. He attacked the enemies of Islam through his writings, sayings, actions, etc. He did everything in his capacity to challenge the enemies of Islam. No person in his presence could say or do anything against Shariah. No person could speak against that which was the truth. It is stated by one of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Khaadim's, who accompanied him on a journey by train, that there were some people in the train who were consuming alcohol.",
      "He would reply to all those who made Salaam to him. On entering the Masjid, he would immediately recite the dua prescribed. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would then remove his Amaama and then sit down to perform Wudhu. He would wash all the parts thoroughly so that the Sunnahs were accomplished. He would perform his Salaah with great sincerity and used to be lost in the worship of his Creator. The person who looked at him from a distance would have instantly understood that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had left all the worldly desires and was intent upon pleasing his Creator. Once, while Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was traveling from Nagpur, it was time for Maghrib Salaah. He immediately disembarked from the train. The people told Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) that the train was about to leave, but he was intent on performing his Salaah. His companions also disembarked with him. They had just performed their Wudhu and were making Niyyah for Salaah when the train left the station. All of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) and his companions luggages' were left on the train. A few un-Islamic people who were there said \"the Mias train had left him\". Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was still in Salaah. When they all had completed their Salaah, they noticed that the station platform was empty. They became a little worried since all their luggage had gone with the train, but still Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) looked undisturbed. His companions were busy talking about the luggage when they noticed the station guard, followed by a group of travellers, running towards them. The guard came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and said, \"Huzoor! The train is stuck!\" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"The engine is damaged.\" The train was brought back and Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and his companions sat in the train.

      "Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size. 1.

We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0). The denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1. For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work. As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1. The eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise."

    "question": "A robotic hand equipped with force sensors is tasked with manipulating objects of varying weights.  The system utilizes a force feedback controller that adjusts the grasp size based on the desired normal force and the measured normal force.  Considering the information provided in the documentation, how does the controller dynamically adapt its grasp strategy to maintain a stable grip while simultaneously preventing damage to both the object and the robotic hand during a complex manipulation task like filling a cup?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The controller prioritizes a fixed grasp size based on the object's weight, adjusting only when slippage is detected.",
      "B) The controller utilizes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm to continuously adjust the grasp size based on the error between the desired and measured normal force.",
      "C) The controller employs a threshold-based approach, adjusting the grasp size only when the measured normal force exceeds a predefined limit, ensuring a safe and controlled grip.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "So when the error between the desired normal force and the actual normal force is large the grasp size decreases so tighter grasp postures are generated in order to apply more normal force. In practice, in order to avoid oscillations in the grasp size we use the desired normal force as a high threshold that we want the measured normal force to be below:\nIf the normal force is below that threshold the grasp size does not change even if there are small oscillations in the measured tangential and normal forces. Also, in order to avoid the hand applying too much force that damages the hardware or the object we use a low threshold, that is: where w threshold is the width of the threshold in mN . If the measured normal force is below the grasp size increases in order to apply less force. So the final grasp size variable for grasping is calculated as follows: where This is similar to the deadband control method , where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. If the response is in this range, the controller does not exert any correction. In our case, the operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. The grasp posture mapping function is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in . It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size. In this work we augment this model to also generate grasp postures conditioned on the grasp type. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate grasps based on more general characteristics such as the type and the size of the grasp. In this way we can control all the fingers jointly by a single value, the grasp size, thus greatly reducing the control parameters. In addition we are able to use the same control algorithm for different precision grasp types, by changing the grasp type conditional variable.",
      "In addition, they required labeled data to train the slip predictors and because each finger is controlled independently is not obvious how to implement different anthropomorphic grasp types. In this work we develop a force controller that takes as input the force readings of the fingertips and computes the grasp size which is then used along with a grasp type label to generate a grasp posture with the desired characteristics. To avoid slippage the desired normal contact force is calculated to be proportional to the tangential contact forces. The applied normal force is then controlled using the size of the grasp as a control variable. Larger grasp sizes mean less force is applied to the object. So the grasp size is calculated from the error between the desired normal force and the actual measured normal force. The grasp size is then given to the posture sampler that generates a grasp posture, i.e. the finger joint angles. The posture sampler is modeled with a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (cVAE) based on the framework proposed in . With this framework we abstract away the low-level control of the fingers and generate hand postures based on high-level properties such as the type and the size of the grasp. So it works as a mapping function that takes as input a low-dimensional vector and the grasp type and size as conditional variables and maps them to a set of joint angles. We show that with our controller we can control a dexterous robotic hand to lift objects of different weights using three precision grasps. Our controller is also able to compensate and retain a stable grasp during changes in the objects' weight, for example when filling up a cup or emptying it. In addition we show how with the addition of the hand pose information we can use the controller to calculate if the tangential force is due to gravity or due to a support surface and use this information to perform handovers and place down objects on surfaces. We perform several real-world experiments with a dexterous robotic hand to showcase the capabilities of our controller and support our design choices.",

Our controller uses the conditional postural synergies framework to generate the grasp postures, i.e. the finger configuration of the robot, at each time step based on forces measured on the robot's fingertips.",
      "Finally, we can modify our controller to release objects instead of grasping them. Given the pose of the hand in the world coordinate frame, which we can acquire from the robotic arm that is attached to, we can use the forward kinematics of the hand to compute the poses of each fingertip. Then using the force readings of each fingertip we can calculate the global direction of the net tangential force. If the angle between the direction of the net tangential force and the direction of gravity is less than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is towards the ground, we assume that the tangential force is due to gravity pulling the object, so the force controller tries to grasp it. If the angle is more than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is upward, it means that something is pushing (or pulling) the object upward, in which case we assume that the object is touching on a support surface or someone is pulling the object so the controller increases the grasp size given to the posture mapping function proportionally to the normal force measured thus slowly releasing the object. Opening the grasp is done by controlling the grasp size variable as follows: That way we can place objects on surfaces but also perform robot to human handovers, where the robot holds the object and the human grasps the object and slightly pushes or pulls it up, signaling to the robot that there is a support surface. The robot then slowly releases the object by opening its grasp. We showcase these scenarios in the experiments' section. Based on these observations, we present our force controller in Figure . The hand starts in an open pre-grasp position, a latent point is sampled from the prior distribution of the posture mapping function, and given the desired grasp type and the grasp size a grasp posture, i.e. the joint angles of the fingers, is sampled. The initial grasp size is set to the maximum value, and when the force controller comes into effect and depending on the state of the system and the forces on the fingertips grasp size changes by some value C, according to equations 1,2, until the desired normal force is achieved.",
      "In our work we use the FTS3 sensors which is a low-cost sensor that measures the 3D force applied in each fingertip. In addition, previous works gathered labeled datasets in order to train their slip prediction models which is time-consuming and limits the possible orientations of the hand, because gathering labeled data for all possible orientations is impractical. To overcome this we experimentally selected the parameters that determine the value of the applied normal force such that we avoid slip for all objects in our dataset, from the lightest to the heaviest. In order to guarantee contact between the fingertip and the object, in the beginning of the grasping phase, we use an offset f of f set n as the minimum normal force applied by each finger. In they also suggest that humans use an additional safety margin which is proportional to the tangential force, f margin n ∝ f t . So the final desired normal contact force becomes: where G is the gain that includes the friction coefficient and the additional safety margin. To alleviate the effects of noise in the sensors, the running average of the measured normal force f n and tangential force f t is used, as a low pass filter. So for each force measurement we have the following relation: where α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter that determines how much new measurements affect the value, and is experimentally selected. Given the measured normal force f n from the fingertip sensors we can compute the error f err n = f des n − f n . We use this error signal to control the grasp size variable g size , that we use as a conditional variable in our posture mapping function. The grasp size represents the distance between the thumb and the index finger in a grasp posture. So a smaller grasp size will result in a tighter grasp and greater normal force applied to the surface of the object. We use a linear controller for the grasp size variable that is implemented as follows: where K is a parameter that controls the rate of decrease of the grasp size, and is experimentally selected."

      "Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little. In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact. At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation. On 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. Opposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017."

      "Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “processing,” “computing,” “calculating,” “determining,” “displaying,” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.

      "A similar pattern was observed when comparing relationships between CPUE (individuals per set) and standardised CPUE for other measures of fishing effort, including numbers of hooks, engine power and number of sets (Fig 2). There was a positive relationship between unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) and number of hooks, number of sets and engine power, but a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behaviour variables when CPUE was standardised by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set). The best fit LM of standardised CPUE indicated that the most significant factors influencing standardised CPUE were fishing gear and number of hooks (p<0.001). Month, engine power, number of sets and fishing ground were also identified as significant variables (Table 5), although there was considerable covariance between these factors. Standardised CPUE was significantly lower in January, and decreased with higher numbers of hooks, despite a higher total catch per trip and set (Fig 2). Table 5. Analysis of variance for linear model of standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set) data from Tanjung Luar; significant values (p<0.05) are given in bold. Best fit GLMs indicated that the most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching threatened species were month (January and November were significantly lower: p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) and fishing ground (Other (i.e. fishing grounds outside of WNTP and ENTP) was significantly higher: p<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of threatened species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing ground (other: p<0.001, ENTP p<0.05), engine power (p<0.001) and trip length (p<0.001) (Table 6 and Fig 3).

Analysis of variance for the best fit models of factors affecting: a) the likelihood of catching and the standardised CPUE of threatened species b) the likelihood of catching and the standardised CPUE of regulated species.",
      "Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly higher for surface longlines than bottom longlines. However, when standardising CPUE for the number of hooks (i.e. individuals per 100 hooks per set) this relationship was reversed. Bottom longlines exhibit a higher standardised CPUE, with negative relationships between catch per 100 hooks per set and number of hooks and frequency of sets. Vessels with moderate engine horsepower (50-59hp) also had the highest standardised CPUE. Since surface longlines systematically employ significantly more hooks than bottom longlines (400–600 vs 25–200 hooks), and tend to be associated with larger boats, longer trips and more sets, these findings suggest that although increasing fishing effort increased total catch for these gears and trips, there were diminishing returns of this increased effort above low to moderate levels. A large proportion of Tanjung Luar’s shark catch consisted of threatened (22%) and regulated species (46%). Month is a significant factor in explaining standardised CPUE of both threatened and regulated species, which could indicate seasonal variation in the abundance of these species in the Tanjung Luar fishing grounds, or seasonal impacts on CPUE due to poor weather conditions. Fishing ground was a significant factor in explaining the catch of threatened species but not the catch in regulated species. This may be due to differences in range, distribution and relative abundance of species within these groups. Threatened species make up a relatively small proportion of Tanjung Luar’s catch in comparison to regulated species, which make up almost half of the catch (46%). As such, regulated species may generally be more abundant and spatially diffuse than threatened species, and therefore caught more uniformly across fishing grounds. For example, regulated species catch is dominated by silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are circum-tropical and coastal-pelagic, and exhibit limited site-fidelity or aggregation behaviour, while threatened species catch is dominated by scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), which are known to aggregate in schools.",
      "The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching regulated species were month (January was significantly lower: p<0.001), number of hooks (p<0.001) and engine power (<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of regulated species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing gear (<0.001), number of sets (p<0.001), engine power (p<0.01) and month (November and January: p<0.05) (Table 5 and Fig 4). Plots of most significant factors affecting standardised CPUE (number of individuals per 100 hooks per set) of regulated species: a) hook number, b) gear type, c) number of sets. Although Tanjung Luar’s targeted shark fishery is small in scale, considerable numbers of shark are landed, including a large proportion of threatened and regulated species. A key finding is that measures of CPUE, for all sharks and for threatened and regulated species, vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. Moreover, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behaviour variables are different for different measures of CPUE (CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, CPUE per 100 hooks per set). This highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types, and has important implications for fisheries management. Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January. This is during the west monsoon season, which is characterised by high rainfall and adverse conditions at sea for fishing. Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly lower in West Nusa Tenggara Province (WNTP) than East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) and other provinces, suggesting a lower abundance of sharks in this area. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE, and was also associated with longer trips and more sets, which was likely due to the ability of vessels with larger engines to travel longer distances, over longer time periods, and with higher numbers of sets, to favoured fishing grounds.",
      "More detailed socioeconomic data were collected in a full household survey in 2016, as outlined in Lestari et al. . Shark landings data were collected by three experienced enumerators, who were trained in species identification and data collection methods during a two-day workshop and three weeks of field mentoring to ensure the accuracy of the data collected. Landings were recorded every morning at the Tanjung Luar shark auction facility where shark fishers usually landed dead sharks, from 5am to 10am from January 2014 to December 2015. The enumerators recorded data on catch composition and fishing behaviour (Table 1) from 52 different vessels across a total of 595 fishing trips. The enumerators also measured the weight of selected sharks to calculate biomass and length-weight relationship. Table 1. Types of data collected on fishing behaviour and catch composition during daily landings data collection at Tanjung Luar. From fishing behaviour and catch data we calculated the overall species composition of catch. We calculated catch per unit effort (CPUE) by number of individuals using both catch per set (hereafter CPUE per set) and catch per 100 hooks per set (hereafter standardised CPUE) [25,26]. This was deemed necessary since different vessels and gear-types systematically deploy different numbers of hooks, and standardised CPUE allows for a more meaningful comparison. To understand factors influencing overall CPUE we log transformed CPUE per trip to fit a normal distribution, and fitted linear models (LMs) of CPUE per trip to fishing behaviour variables (Table 1). We considered all variables and used minimum AIC values with stepwise analysis of variance to identify the best fit and most significant influencing variables. To inform the development of practical fisheries management measures (e.g. gear restrictions), we also specifically analysed differences in CPUE for surface and bottom longline gears employed in the fishery, using two-way ANOVAs. Factors affecting catch of threatened and regulated species.",
      "These schools of scalloped hammerheads may be more restricted to specific aggregation sites outside of WNTP and ENTP waters, while silky sharks are found in uniform abundance throughout fishing grounds. As with CPUE of all catch, there was a positive relationship between unstandardised CPUE (catch per set) of threatened and regulated species and number of hooks, but a significant negative relationship between standardised CPUE (catch per 100 hooks per set). This was likely due to diminishing returns of adding additional hooks, and indicates that the effort for threatened and regulated species was exceeding maximum sustainable yield effort, such that increases in effort (e.g. hook number) were leading to decreases in catch [28–30]. Due to the profitability of the shark industry in Tanjung Luar, and limited adaptive capacity and willingness of shark fishers to move into other industries, it is necessary to identify practical and ethical management interventions that can improve the sustainability of the fishery whilst also mitigating the negative socio-economic consequences for coastal communities. Our findings indicate that spatiotemporal closures and restrictions on fishing effort could improve the overall catch per unit effort and sustainability of the Tanjung Luar shark fishery, and lead to positive conservation outcomes for priority species. Since the location of shark fishing grounds plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of catching threatened species and their associated CPUE, improved marine spatial planning, with the identification of marine protected areas (MPAs) that protect critical shark habitat and shark populations, could reduce catch of species of conservation concern [31–33] and increase abundance of sharks [34, 35]. Provincial governments in West Papua and West Nusa Tenggara have already established ‘shark sanctuary’ MPAs, which protect critical shark habitat and ban shark fishing within their boundaries [16, 36], and monitoring data indicates positive impacts of shark-specific closures on shark abundance"

      "Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies. In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse. Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions. The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures. Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".

      "Also, Fig.~\\ref{fig_situation1_VehiclesTrajectories} illustrates an example comparing between the predicted and observed trajectories of the two vehicles using the two interactive matrices depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_interactiveMatrices}. From Fig.~\\ref{fig_situation1_PredictedRF} and Fig.~\\ref{fig_situation1_VehiclesTrajectories} we can see that using an interactive matrix with less clusters allows to perform better predictions compared to that with more clusters. This can be validated by observing Fig.~\\ref{fig_rmse_onTraj_onSig} that illustrates the RMSE values versus different number of clusters related to the two models representing the dynamics of the received RF signals and the vehicles' trajectories. It can be seen that as the number of clusters increases the RMSE error increases, since adding more clusters decreases the firing probability that explains the possibility to be in one of the $M_{2}$ clusters of the second model conditioned in being in a certain cluster of the first model. Fig.~\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories} illustrates an example of vehicle's trajectory under normal situation (i.e., jammer and spoofer are absent), under jamming attacks and under spoofing attacks. Also the figure shows the predicted trajectory which should follow the same dynamic rules learned during a normal situation. After that, we implemented the IM-MJPF on the learned C-GDBN to perform multiple predictions, i.e., to predict the RF signal that the RSU is expecting to receive from a certain vehicle and the corresponding trajectory that the vehicle is supposed to follow. IM-MJPF through the comparison between multiple predictions and observations, produces multiple abnormality signals as defined in \\eqref{eq_CLA1} and \\eqref{eq_CLA2} which are used to detect the jammer and the spoofer. Fig.~\\ref{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer} illustrates the multiple abnormality signals related to the example shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}. We can observe that the abnormal signals related to both RF signal (Fig.~\\ref{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}-(a)) and trajectory (Fig.~\\ref{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}-(b)) are below the threshold under normal situations.",
      "In this work, we propose a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in the V2X network. A coupled generalized dynamic Bayesian network (C-GDBN) is employed to learn the interaction between RF signals received by the RSU from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. This integration of vehicles' positional information with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications allows semantic learning while mapping RF signals with vehicles' trajectories and enables the RSU to jointly predict the RF signals it expects to receive from the vehicles from which it can anticipate the expected trajectories. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \\textit{i)} A joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection method is proposed for the V2X scenario, which is based on learning a generative interactive model as the C-GDBN. Such a model encodes the cross-correlation between the RF signals transmitted by multiple vehicles and their trajectories, where their semantic meaning is coupled stochastically at a high abstraction level. \\textit{ii)} A cognitive RSU equipped with the acquired C-GDBN can predict and estimate vehicle positions based on real-time RF signals. This allows RSU to evaluate whether both RF signals and vehicles' trajectories are evolving according to the dynamic rules encoded in the C-GDBN and, consequently, to identify the cause (i.e., a jammer attacking the V2I or a spoofer attacking the satellite link) of the abnormal behaviour that occurred in the V2X environment. \\textit{iii)} Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the vehicles' trajectories from the predicted RF signals, effectively detect any abnormal behaviour and identify the type of abnormality occurring with high detection probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies the joint detection of jamming and spoofing in V2X systems. \\section{System model and problem formulation}\nThe system model depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_SystemModel}, includes a single cell vehicular network consisting of a road side unit (RSU) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{R}=[{x}_{R},{y}_{R}]$, a road side jammer (RSJ) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{J}=[{x}_{J},{y}_{J}]$, a road side spoofer (RSS) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{s}=[{x}_{s},{y}_{s}]$ and $N$ vehicles moving along multi-lane road in an urban area.",

It can be seen that the proposed method is able to detect the jammer with high probabilities (near $1$) and by considering low and high jamming powers. Also, the figure compares the performance in detecting the jammer by varying the number of clusters ($M_{2}$). Fig.~\\ref{fig_spooferDetectionProb} shows the overall performance of the proposed method in detecting the spoofer by testing different different examples of driving maneuvers. It can be seen that the RSU is able to detect the spoofer with high detection probability and null false alarm versus different number of clusters. \\section{Conclusion}\nA joint detection method of GPS spoofing and jamming attacks is proposed. The method is based on learning a dynamic interactive model encoding the cross-correlation between the received RF signals from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. Simulation results show the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in jointly detecting the GPS spoofer and jammer attacks. Subsequent work will extend the system model to consider more than two vehicles with different channel conditions and various modulation schemes to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}",
      "This proves that RSU learned the correct dynamic rules of how RF signals and trajectories evolve when the jammer and spoofer are absent (i.e., under normal situations). Also, we can see that the RSU can notice a high deviation on both the RF signal and the corresponding trajectory due to a jamming interference from what it has learned so far by relying on the abnormality signals. In contrast, we can see that under spoofing attacks, RSU notice a deviation only on the trajectory and not on the RF signal since the spoofer has affected only the positions without manipulating the RF signal. In addition, it is obvious how the proposed method allows the RSU to identify the type of abnormality occurring and to explain the cause of the detected abnormality (i.e., understanding if it was because of a jammer attacking the V2I link or a spoofer attacking the satellite link). \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{Results/trajectories_underJamming_andSpoofing}\n   \n    \\caption{Vehicle's trajectory under: normal situation, jamming and spoofing.}\n    \\label{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n        \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onRF}\n        \\\\[-1.5mm]\n        {\\scriptsize (a)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n            \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onGPS}\n            \\\\[-1.5mm]\n            {\\scriptsize (b)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        %\n        \\caption{Abnormality Signals related to the example shown in Fig.\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}: (a) abnormality indicators related to the RF signal, (b) abnormality indicators related to the trajectory.}\n            \\label{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[height=3.2cm]{Results/Detection_Probability_RFfromGPS_versusPj}\n    \\caption{Detection probability ($\\mathrm{P_{d}}$) versus jammer's power ($\\mathrm{P_{J}}$) using different number of clusters $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$.}\n    \\label{fig_jammerDetectionProb}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]",

These models allow the RSU to predict the trajectory the vehicle will follow based on the received RF signal and evaluate whether the V2I is under jamming attacks or the satellite link is under spoofing. It is to note that the RSU is receiving only the RF signals from the two vehicles and obtaining their positions after decoding the RF signals. Thus, the RSU should be able to evaluate if the received RF signals are evolving according to the dynamic rules learned so far and if the vehicles are following the expected (right) trajectories to decide whether the V2I links are really under attack or whether the satellite link is under spoofing. Fig.~\\ref{fig_receivedRFsignalandTrajectory}-(a) illustrates an example of the interaction between the two vehicles performing a particular manoeuvre, and Fig.~\\ref{fig_receivedRFsignalandTrajectory}-(b) shows the received RF signals by the RSU from the two vehicles. At the beginning of the learning process, RSU performs predictions according to the simplified model defined in \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} where $\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{\\Tilde{S}_{t}}^{(i)}} {=} 0$. After obtaining the generalized errors as pointed out in \\eqref{GE_continuousLevel_initialModel}, RUS clusters those errors using GNG to learn two GDBN models encoding the dynamic rules of how the RF signal and the GPS signal evolve with time, respectively, as showed in Fig.~\\ref{fig_GNG_of_receivedRFsignalandTrajectory} and Fig.~\\ref{fig_graphicalRep_transitionMatrices}."

Thanks. I am sorry to inform you but AB 602 is not the LAW as you so stated in your blog. I contacted the Deputy Chief Council’s office in Sacramento handling AB 602 to confirm your misstatement of facts. You know,in the English language, It shouldn’t be so difficult to answer some simple questions with a “YES” or “NO” answer. Yet, you are reluctant to do so, but you go on and on with a thesis along with some rhetoric. I never talked about a court suit over the “water issue”, I asked YOU, not about waiting for a court decision. Maybe, you did with some other people. Also, I was not ranting about the wineries usage of water. My response to you on your vague question about “there are people not paying their fair share for their use of water”. I related, are you talking about the wineries? I am well aware that most of the wineries are outside the city limits using the same aquifer. You took my question out of context., nice try! You are just being a popinjay and rhetorical. Also, you didn’t answer another question about “what is the unit cost of water” in Templeton?",

Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use”. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn’t give our City Council a “BLANK CHECK” for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a “special tax” or “an assessment” be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes.

      "Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference. Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully. At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line. At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line. Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction. After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side. Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape. Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs.",
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch.",
      "The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it. I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily. When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank.",
      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed."

They failed to pass a budget. Don't the Democrats deserve a lot of the blame for this current impasse?\nNORTON: Absolutely not, because the Democrats would never have held our budget up here. LISA BLOOM, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Why didn't they pass the budget?\nNORTON: Well, that doesn't have anything to do with us. This is our local money. All it would take is -- the Democrats in the Senate are ready to agree.

Give me an example of what's going to happen if there's a government shutdown.\nNORTON: Absolutely, although your viewers will be shocked by what they are about to hear. They know a little bit about taxation without representation -- we pay our taxes, then we have full representation in the House and the Senate. But I bet they didn't know that our local budget, without a dime of federal money in it -- and we support ourselves almost entirely -- has to be sent to the masters in the Congress to sign off on it before we can spend our own local money. Well, listen to this, Wolf. We passed our budget in -- last spring. The appropriators signed off on it last summer. So, why are we in a federal budget fight over their money when it is our money I am talking about? I have put forward amendments that said the district can spend its own local funds. BLITZER: What's going to happen in the District of Columbia Saturday, Sunday, Monday, if there is a government shutdown? Give me an example or two.\nNORTON: I will give you some dramatic ones. How about the shutdown of the D.C. government itself?

      "Vitamin K - Wikipedia\n(Redirected from Vitamin k)\nThis article needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources. Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015) This article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed]. Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2. Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2.",
      "All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation. Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]\nAdequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk.",
      "Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain. The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.",
      "Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]\nPhylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone. A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain."

The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson. History\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County. Peketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.",

      "In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years. In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood."

Tags: Ann Schwab Chico CA, Ann Schwab for city council, Dave Burkand Chico Ca, Friends of Ann Schwab, Jennifer Hennessy Chico Ca\nStephanie Taber answers Quentin Colgan’s letter to the News and Review\nI get complaints from friends and strangers, and it has also been my own experience, that the editor of the Chico News and Review is not always objective in deciding which letters received from the public will be printed in the paper and which ones won’t. Robert Speer has offered me excuses, but I have always found him to be disingenuous. For example – he told me he would only run letters that referenced an article or letter recently printed in the paper – untrue a million times over. He also told me he wouldn’t print letters that had already run in the Enterprise Record – also untrue a million times over. The man has his own reasons for running or not running letters. David Little is more objective, but he’s got his faults too – once he threw out a letter from my husband and later admitted he had thought I’d written it and used my old man’s name. He just threw it out without even calling the phone number or e-mailing, just assumed I’d do something like that when I’d never done anything like that before, because he was mad at me over a snit we were having at the time. I think Little gets his nose out at people personally, and Hell hath no fury, know what I mean? With Speer it can personal but I think it’s most often political. Suffice to say, they both carry what my dad used to call a “Shit List,” and if you’re on it, you don’t get ink in their rag. Of course either paper is equally likely to print a total wad of lies or misinformation without so much as a google fact check. I will never forget the time Dave Little printed a letter saying the cops had been called to my house on a dog complaint. The letter writer insinuated that this was why I often wrote letters complaining about the cop contracts.",
      "July | 2012 | Chico Taxpayers Association\nKeep a Knockin’ but you can’t come in! Come back next Tuesday night and try it again! And be sure to bring plenty of your friends. Toby Schindelbeck has finally been rewarded for his persistence – he’s been going before Chico City Council, asking that Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy comply with city code and give a budget report at every meeting. City clerk Debbie Presson has informed him that this subject will be “discussed” at the August 7 council meeting. But we know, it won’t be a very good “discussion” unless a bunch of people come in and demand some action. Toby has observed that issues like Corporate Personhood and the “single-use” plastic bag ban have drawn fairly small crowds – he estimates 25 – 30 people, and I’d say he’s being generous. The city has acted on these issues, with only that small fraction of the population in support. So, Toby believes there needs to be an even stronger presence to get a decent discussion on this matter, and I agree. Like Toby and Stephanie Taber and others have been saying, the city code calls for a monthly budget report, with sticky details like receipts, etc, and Jennifer Hennessy admits she has not made such a report in the seven years she’s been with the city of Chico. Try not paying your taxes for seven years – you’ll get the same treatment as the man from Touch of Class Florist – 68 years old, and he’s being sent to PRISON. But Jennifer Hennessy and her boss Dave Burkland, and their overseer, Mayor Ann Schwab, get to flog the law right in front of everybody, and Ann just steps right into that little red convertible and drives off to her palatial estate in Forest Ranch. The law is a piece of paper. It takes people to demand law enforcement. We’ve got a serious law enforcement problem in our town. The police say they aren’t paid enough to enforce the laws in the streets, and now Dave Burkland says, he just doesn’t have to. And your mayor won’t make him either. He’s retiring, on more than $150,000 a year, for the rest of his life, but she’s up for election in November – time to take out the trash.",

      "Stephanie attends the meetings, she reads the reports, she goes to the trouble of putting questions in writing for $taff, and then waiting persistently for an answer that practically has to be deciphered by a lawyer. She has followed this budget conversation since the day then-city-manager and first rat to jump, Greg Jones, expressed his grave concerns that we were headed straight for bankruptcy. She has followed the figures and checked the facts until she has forced these rats right to the wall – they have lately begun to dig their feet in and refuse to obey the sunshine laws, refusing to give the fiscal reports demanded by the city charter. Some people can try to run their little smokescreen of repetitive nonsense, but more rational people are finding out the truth. Thanks to Stephanie Taber for writing this letter below, which may or may not run in the Chico News and Review:\nI’d like to take this opportunity to respond to Quentin Colgan’s letter of July 12th; primarily because the costs surrounding the Special Election held regarding Measure A have been distorted. Yes, it did cost $150,000, but why? That’s the elephant in the room. The progressives on the City Council chose the method by which the election would be held. Per the City Charter (which is the City’s Constitution) Section 501 clearly states “The City Council may determine that any Special Election shall be held by mailed ballot” etc. That would have cut the cost by half, at least. But the Council chose the most expensive means possible, voting at the precinct. They were afraid that just telling the students they were being disenfranchised, which was an obvious lie, would not be sufficient to defeat it. As to “it’s all the Tea Party’s fault”; I was the only signature to the Measure. I felt no need to consult the Tea Party before I took that action; but did enlist the help of many concerned citizens to gather the more than 8,000 signature required to put it on the ballot. Toby Schindelbeck has called upon our Finance Director to adhere to Section 908 of the City’s Charter which states “(the) Finance Director shall submit to the Council through the City Manager monthly statements of receipts, disbursements and balances in such form as to show the exact financial condition of the City”."

      "As operator of the Greater Ekofisk Area, Phillips had placed capital to be used for new investment in banks around the world – particularly the UK. These deposits yielded substantial interest payments, and tax was payable on converting this income into Norwegian kroner.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Toralv Torstenbø, former chief executive officer in Sola local authority, interviewed by Kristin Øye Gjerde, 22 February 2001. Sola council is said to have almost gone into shock the first time Phillips paid this agio tax. It suddenly had more money than it could spend. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Sola’s municipal income always exceeded the budgeted amount. Large sums could be transferred every year to a capital fund. Since the local authority was in a growth phase, additional funding was needed for the big developments it faced. While the rest of Norway experienced a slump in the late 1970s, Sola continued in top gear without a sign of unemployment. Net income tax revenues came to NOK 55.5 million in 1978, while net spending was NOK 31.9 million. And these fantastic results went on improving. By 1982, wealth and income taxes yielded NOK 203.4 million – compared with a budget of NOK 146 million, which was upgraded to NOK 190 million during the year. According to Toralv Torstensbø, the financial controller, agio tax accounted for almost half this amount – in other words, as much as the tax paid by all other enterprises, private individuals and industry in Sola. Its chief executive officer became a little overweening. In his comments on the 1982 budget, he declared that it would be “natural for Sola local authority to feel a strong regional responsibility and not to be too strict about the traditional division of costs between state, county and local authority.” In line with this open-handed policy, Sola paid for both road projects and an upper secondary modern school which the county council was supposed to fund.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer’s budget proposal for Sola local authority covering 1974-85.",
      "About NOK 2 million was received annually from Phillips, primarily in property tax. The most important taxpayers in the local authority were the roughly 90 companies at Aker Base. These were service providers such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. At the same time, Sola acquired a steadily growing number of affluent residents and a growing share of its revenue came from income tax. Despite the cut-backs, it remained prosperous. Published 29.

In simple terms, however, the field and the rest of Norway’s continental shelf (NCS) belongs to the Norwegian state.

This permits licences to be awarded on certain terms.

South Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax. Judicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1× 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405–10 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (“[Justice Brandeis’s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.”). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with “special force. ”2× 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between “constitutional” and “statutory” precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between “constitutional” and “nonconstitutional cases.” See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has — until now — adhered to Justice Brandeis’s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3× 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4× 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421–27 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must “address a false constitutional premise . . . .",
      "Id. at 2102 (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 279, 318 (1992)). while Justice Scalia had “recogniz[ed] that stare decisis has ‘special force’ in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress’s ‘final say over regulation of interstate commerce.’”48× 48. Id. (quoting Quill, 504 U.S. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). Moreover, “[i]f stare decisis applied with special force in Quill, it should be an even greater impediment” afterward since Quill effectively “tossed [the ball] into Congress’s court. ”49× 49. Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Kimble, 135 S. Ct. at 2409); cf. Bay Mills, 134 S. Ct. at 2039 n.12 (“When we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.”). Because the Court invited Congress to act and then “suddenly chang[ed] the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress’s consideration of the issue. ”50× 50. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102–03 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Wayfair, the Court applied the flimsier form of stare decisis to a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress. It did so in the context of a dormant commerce clause case, but Wayfair’s logic extends to all constitutional default rules — that is, constitutional decisions that Congress remains free to change. Not only does Wayfair deviate from the Court’s decades-old stare decisis analysis, it also imperils other precedents that set constitutional default rules. The Court’s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare decisis must bend “in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible.”51× 51. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406–07 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court has long since adopted his argument,52× 52. See, e.g., Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944)."

      "In \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \\cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions.",
      "At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \\cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \\cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \\cite{forney73} for run-time inference. \\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}\nThe effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities.",
      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition.

Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures.

      "All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) . Since γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser. Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps. This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising.",
      "Essentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise. Therefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps . For example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a \"supercircuit\" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise. This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values. In superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.\nWe illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer.",
      "Here the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation. The success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate. These propagated errors * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de ≈ C\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue). Because the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit. We first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.",
      "We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel. Results. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step . We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise. We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t. Depending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.",
      "This yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix. We construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters. To determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ. Here γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2.

We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions."

      "The below results also show that it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the following research problem. Other parameters used for the simulation are: c = 1.0, η Air = η bubble = 10.0,\nI Air = 3, I bubble = 15, ∆x = ∆y = 1.2 × 10 −4 and ∆t = 1 × 10 −6 . The viscosity effect is feeble compared to the shock compression effect, so it does not significantly affect the deformation of the bubble. Therefore, in this part, the relaxation time τ is set sufficiently small. The inflow (outflow) boundary condition is used in the left (right) boundary, and the periodic boundary is adopted in the y direction. The first-order forward difference scheme is used to calculate the temporal derivative, and the second-order nonoscillatory nonfree dissipative scheme is adopted to solve the spatial derivative in Eq. ( ) . Two quantitative comparisons between experimental results and DBM simulations are shown in the following part, including snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales for the bubble. The first is shown in Fig. non-organized momentum flux (NOMF) uously to form a diffracted shock (DS). As TS propagates, it will split into three branches due to the considerable pressure perturbations caused by the gradual decay of the DS strength . Afterward, as shown in the subfigure at about t = 128µs, two high pressure regions (ROH) generate because of the interaction of these branches. Subsequently, at about t = 148µs, the two ROHs meet, causing the shock focusing. On the one hand, at about t = 168µs, the shock focusing causes the generation of downstream-propagating second transmitted shock (STS) and upward-moving rarefaction wave. On the other hand, it will produce high pressure region inside the bubble, which later leads to a jet structure, as shown at about t = 288µs. At about t = 428µs, due to the deposited vorticity, there will produce a pair of counter-rotating vortexes at the pole region of the bubble. The further development of the vortex pair and the effect of viscosity decrease the amplitude of the jet.",

Ignoring the pressure difference between interior gas and ambient gas, the initial parameters of the bubble are ρ bubble = 4.859kg/m 3 , p bubble = 101.3kPa,\nand T 0 = 293K. For simulating, these actual physical quantities should be transferred to dimensionless parameters. This process can refer to the Appendix A. The dimensionless conditions of macroscopic quantities of the fluid field in initial time are (ρ, T, u x , u y ) bubble = (4.0347, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 1 = (1.3416,\n1.128, 0.3616, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 0 = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), where the subscript \"0\" (\"1\") represents downstream (upstream) region. In two-fluid DBM code, the distribution function f Air is used to describe the ambient gas, i.e., Air. The f bubble characters the bubble which is a mixture that composed of Air and SF 6 . The grid number is N x × N y = 800 × 400, where the N x and N y are grid number in x and y direction, respectively. This grid size has passed the mesh convergence test.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Finally, the jet structure disappears. The second quantitative comparison is the interface structure described by the length and width of the bubble, as shown in Fig. . The experimental data are extracted from Fig. , in Ref. . Quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results are seen. For the profile of bubble width, there are mainly two stages. At an early time (t < 150µs), it decreases to a minimum value because of the shock compression effect. After the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 150µs), the developed vortex pair caused by the deposited vorticity gradually dominates the growth of bubble width. Different from width evolution, the temporal variation of length experiences three stages. In the early stages (t < 150µs), it decreases quickly due to the shock compression effect. Then, the jet structure emerges, which results in a growth in length (150µs < t < 250µs). Because the upstream interface moves faster than the downstream interface, the bubble length would decrease at 250µs < t < 500µs. In the third stage (t > 500µs), the vortex pair forms and then leads to a continuous development of bubble length. Both the length and width experience oscillations in the later stages due to complex wave patterns. The quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities and spatial-temporal steps and simulation parameters like the relaxation times is suitable for characterizing the deformation of bubble, wave patterns, main characteristics of flow morphology. Effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI\n\nThe major of current works on SBI research have not focused on specific-heat ratio effects. In this part, the simulation parameters are fine-adjusted based on the parameters in Section 3.1 to highlight the influence of specific-heat ratio. Through adjusting the extra degree of freedom I, five cases with various specific-heat ratios of the bubble are simulated, i.e., γ = 1.4,\n1.28, 1.18, 1.12, and 1.09.",

      "God comes and gives them a spanking and sends them out of the garden. Ok, so the details might be a little off… maybe even a little forgettable. But the story is familiar and the consequences tragic. We live in those consequences. So what does this story have to tell us about the world today and our lives in it? You can learn a lot about sin and humanity by really chewing on the details here. Consider:\nThe serpent (we’re later told it’s also Satan) begins with questioning what God has said. The question overgeneralizes and invites a conversation. The woman adds to God’s commandment. The serpent challenges God and offers a desirable half-truth. The woman (although perfect) is tempted. That temptation draws her to inspect the fruit. Looking at the fruit, the woman focused on the positive side of the equation. She risked her life trusting the serpent over God, because eating the fruit should have meant certain death. The man ate without any signs of a struggle. Their eyes were open. Before they knew only the good; now they knew good and evil. Their first response to sin is to cover up, which indicates fear and probably shame. Their response to God (their creator whom they knew personally!) was to hide. Apparently they either didn’t know or forgot that God is everywhere and knows everything. God asks the man a question for effect. The man blames his wife and even seems to accuse God. The woman blames the serpent and even seems to deflect by saying she was tricked. At this point God punishes the serpent, the man, and the woman by cursing all creation. Work will be hard, childbearing will be painful. But there is hope in the promise of One to come who will crush the serpent. I love how the Good News glimmers even in that first dark moment. It’s so tempting to read more into the story because there are so many more details we wish we had. The gaps in the story invite our imaginations to jump in, but we need to be careful not to put words in God’s mouth. One theme we see in the Fall is one broken relationship after another.",
      "No. God doesn’t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. God doesn’t will for us to do evil or to harm other people. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death. This post was adapted from my sermon preached at Butner Federal Prison on September 14, 2014. We were gathered at the plaza, right between the giant bull statue and the unattractive fences of a construction site. Luminary bags weighted with rice and lit candles marked the sacred space surrounding 30 of us, one to represent each person who died as a result of domestic violence the previous year in our state. The vigil began as planned, simple, but meaningful, to remember victims of this tragedy and raise awareness about the suffering that takes place behind closed doors. About halfway through the simple service, a woman stumbled into the vigil, interrupting the solemn mood without realizing that a group was gathered and someone was speaking. She stood silent for a few moments, listening to the speaker. When she realized that the speaker was talking about domestic violence, she began to interrupt, asking questions to the speaker, sharing details from her own experience with abuse. “What would you do…what would you do if…?” she cried. Then, as unexpectedly as she joined us and as abruptly as her interruption, she began to weep, uncontrollably crying for the rest of the vigil. A couple of women gathered around her and held her as she wept. Before long, it was my turn to pray. I barely got the words out…I could hardly project my shaking voice over her loud sobs. “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,” Jesus proclaims in the second line of the beatitudes. Blessed are those who mourn. How is this weeping woman, this victim of abuse, blessed? She mourns the injustices she’s experienced, her suffering, the ways her life has been shaped by pain and her inability to free herself from her oppression.",
      "It took a long time to get there. No, extreme depravity wasn’t the result of the Fall, but total depravity still is. Total depravity is the doctrine that says sin bent every part of man. Sin pollutes man’s reason, man’s emotions, man’s willpower, man’s desires, man’s imagination, man’s memories, man’s senses, man’s body, and even man’s conscience. Nothing is safe. Nothing is pure. And this is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. Remember that man was made in God’s image, unique among all creation. But sin now pollutes that image. It’s still present—we still can’t help but “image” our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God’s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil. Comparing Theories\nNow if we take a step back, we all recognize that we live in a broken world. Very few people would argue that everything is perfect, that sin, suffering, and death somehow don’t exist or aren’t really bad. We (generally) all agree that there’s a problem. But there’s little agreement about why it is the way it is. People who don’t believe in a literal Adam and Even tanking the human race are generally stuck. For example, if you only believe in the natural world, evil is just a part of nature. Death is a part of life. Suffering is a biochemical response to destructive conditions. And if you’re just one organism out of millions competing for resources, all you can really say is that you don’t like these things. They are distasteful. Maybe you’re hard-wired to show empathy with others because of some evolutionary imperative, but objectively speaking what can you say? Well, you can say lots I suppose, but you can’t be consistent without ending up a nihilist. Other religions have the same problem: either evil belongs as some part of the bigger cosmic plan or it’s an illusion. Either way, it’s hard to take evil seriously. Either it belongs in some way, or it doesn’t exist at all.",
      "We sometimes get confused about the role death plays in God’s plan. So today we examine what the Bible says about death and reconsider what role it plays in our lives. It’s interesting: there’s a way in which you could read the Bible as a book about death. That’s obviously not all it talks about, but the “story arc” of death spans the entire book. Let’s take a stroll, shall we? The first mention of death is in the second chapter of the Bible: “in the day you eat of [the forbidden fruit] you will surely die” (Genesis 2:17). This promise was the center of the debate between the woman and the serpent in Genesis 3, and they ate of the fruit. But they didn’t die. God was gracious not to put them to death physically, but there is a kind of spiritual death that took place then. Since the Fall, mankind has been unresponsive to God. But make no mistake, physical death was coming. We know from Romans that death entered through Adam’s sin—it wasn’t part of the original created order. And as proof, we see in Adam’s genealogy the reign of death: each one dies. We read “and he died” over and over here. Romans 3:23 tells us “the wages of sin is death.” All sinned, so all die. Death had become a part of life. But Genesis is just getting warmed up! Because next comes the Flood where—you guessed it—everybody dies. Then the Patriarchs die. Then the book ends with the death of Joseph. Who ends a book that way?!? This is not a happy ending. But then there’s Exodus, where the Egyptians die, Leviticus where animals die, Numbers where unbelieving Israel dies, Joshua where the Canaanites die. Death is everywhere! It’s all over the Pentateuch. Why would this be? Because death is the punishment for sin. All crimes against God are capital offenses. That doesn’t mean He immediately smites everyone the moment they sin—but technically speaking, He could. That would be just. And if it doesn’t feel just then maybe we don’t understand sin as well as we thought we did. In Ezekiel, God tells us He gets no pleasure from the death of the wicked.",
      "When we lose a loved one, it’s hard. If he or she is a believer, we’re comforted by the fact that even though they died they enjoy the sweetness of Christ’s presence. Don’t let anyone take that away from you. Just don’t forget: that’s not the end of the story. It gets better! They won’t stay dead. Who is this God who can even bring good out of death? Today is Ash Wednesday. Many Christians will receive ash on their foreheads and be reminded, “You are dust, and to dust you will return.” Not a message we particularly like to hear. We often think of ourselves as souls who just happen to be in bodies, that our parts are interchangeable—maybe even expendable. But these words are the words God Himself spoke to Adam after the Fall. You are dust. A sobering thought. Our bodies are a part of us, and our reflection is a daily reminder that we’re not as strong as we think we are. That’s not the whole truth about us, but it’s a part we can’t afford to forget. Considering our frailty and our mortality shouldn’t lead to despair; it should bring us to our knees before our Savior. We confess how much we need Him, and how grateful we are that we have Him. Recognizing our insufficiency is just one way we deepen our appreciation for all we have in Christ. We humble ourselves not to make Him greater but because He is greater! He has brought us forgiveness and eternal life, sent us His Spirit. If we were left to our own devices, we would have no hope. But because of His love, rich in mercy, we have this gift from God.

Still a bit of an unknown, numbers are fairly average in the Serbian YUBA league. Damir Markota, 6-11, SF/PF, Cibona Zagreb 1985 Croatia Second round pick American agent Marc Cornstein told us Markota will definitely be putting his name in the draft once again.

Jahsha Bluntt, 6-6, SG, Deleware State Junior No Undrafted Puts up fairly average numbers (14.6 ppg, 41% FG) in one of the worst conferences in America. Looking for exposure at the Orlando pre-draft camp but its highly unlikely to receive it. Josh Boone, 6-10, PF/C, UConn Junior No First round pick? Boone announced hell be entering the draft without an agent. An up and down season has left his stock in the air, and will likely force him to prove himself at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Would greatly benefit from a productive senior season as an offensive focal point now that UConn has lost almost all of its firepower from last year. Ronnie Brewer, 6-6, PG/SG, Arkansas Junior No Lottery pick? After initially wavering a bit on his decision, Brewer announced hell be entering the draft without an agent in a press conference.

Pinnock will have to show better ball-handling and perimeter shooting ability than he did during the regular season. Leon Powe, 6-7, PF, Cal Sophomore No Second round pick Powe announced hell be testing the waters in a statement released by Cal. Where he ends up being projected depends heavily on how his knee checks out. Powe is already considered a serious tweener by NBA scouts, and had a hard time this season gaining back much of the explosiveness he had earlier in his career. Could realistically go undrafted should he decide to stay in. Richard Roby, 6-5, SG, Colorado Sophomore Likely Second round pick As first indicated by DraftExpress Roby has decided to test the waters. Disappeared against any major competition he went up against, particularly towards the end of the season. Roby will likely have to put on weight in the next few months and show off his perimeter stroke in the Orlando pre-draft camp. Sources tell us that he is on the verge of making a huge mistake by hiring an agent. Rajon Rondo, 6-2, PG, Kentucky Sophomore Yes First round pick As expected, Rondo has decided to enter the NBA draft, and has also hired an agent, Bill Duffy. Despite an inconsistent sophomore season, most scouts weve spoken to still had him as at least the #2 point guard on their board because of his intriguing upside. Workouts will be huge for him. Blake Schilb, 6-7, SG/SF, Loyola Chicago Junior No Undrafted Declared his intentions to enter the draft, without an agent, and is hoping for an invite to Orlando. Schlib is sorely lacking in the quickness and explosiveness departments that scouts demand from swingman prospects, but he makes up for it with his skill set to a certain extent. Regardless, sources tell us he wont be invited to Orlando, meaning he has to go back to school. Mustafa Shakur, 6-4, PG, Arizona Junior No Second round pick? According to the Arizona Star, Shakur will likely enter his name in the draft, without an agent."

BC has yet to offer, but is following him. BCeagles.com posted a Q&A with Bobby Swiggert yesterday. I found his talk about paring down the offense encouraging. We need to work on execution not diversity of plays. HD put out this offseason filler piece ranking coaching jobs in the ACC. I don't really care where she perceives us. When the job changes we will be very attractive to the right guy for us. Labels: Bobby Swigert, Chris Pantale, emmett cleary, Heather Dinich, Kaleb Ramsey, Links, Recruiting, Truman Gutapfel\nWhere is the one that got away? While we've struggled recruiting Massachusetts players this year, we've cleaned up in Connecticut and in Ohio. Those local kids (or other lay-up recruits) we miss generate plenty of frustration but they happen every year. What's fortunate about our misses though, is that very few have come back to haunt us. When was the last time a great recruit spurned BC and became a star? I can think of a few over the years, but most of the recruits that \"got away\" had middling careers elsewhere. Some recent examples of guys who spurned us include Graham Stewart, Arthur Lynch and Joe Boisture. All three committed to BC at one point only to rethink their decisions and go to bigger programs. Stewart washed out at Florida and is now sitting out a transfer year at UConn. Boisture is out of football altogether. Lynch has been a backup at Georgia. He has a chance for a bigger role this season, but so far has not lived up to the hype that surrounded his recruitment.

Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them. Fewer Seats\nThe NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats.

      "No BC player made the ACC's preseason all conference team. They have two likeable but rather unknown Seniors on the cover of the media guide. Perception matters in college football. Obviously tickets sales are part of that, but lacking a star player hurts when TV networks are selecting our games. Even if some of our players have breakout years, they will have a hard time winning national awards. BC created some new and unique ticket packages to help attendance for the less attractive games. If we are play well, TV networks might pay attention during the last month of the season. But if the team struggles, it will be hard to sell anything. You can't force players to be great or be dynamic personalities. Even if players aren't well known, I am consistently proud of how they handle themselves.

      "Notice anyone missing? It is just a silly Youtbue video but I find it very telling that the school left out the Head Coach. This is college football. Your head coach is the face of the program. Ours isn't even mentioned in a direct marketing message to our most loyal customers. There are many likely explanations for Spaz's absence. He's not particularly good on camera. He's never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. And I think BC has heard enough to know that Spaz is not very popular with our fan base. No reason to trot him out when it will just dampen excitement about the upcoming season. I like Bill McGovern and Doug Martin. Both are capable coordinators and leaders. Martin's been a head coach and I know McGovern wants to be one, so giving them face time is not a bad idea.

For this, what it is necessary to have the XY model, it is that the intensities are always the same on the different samples\n(so that the matrix $t_{ij}$ is the same for different phase data). If the intensities are fixed, then they can be incorporated in $t_{ij}$ and eq (2) can be written just for phases as described. \\\\\n}\n\\end{comment}\n\n\n  \\section{Pseudolikelihood Maximization}\n  \\label{sec:plm}\nThe inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the parameters $J_{nm}$ of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (\\ref{eq:h_im}). Given a set of $M$ data configurations of $N$ spins\n $\\bm\\sigma = \\{ \\cos \\phi_i^{(\\mu)},\\sin \\phi_i^{(\\mu)} \\}$, $i = 1,\\dots,N$ and $\\mu=1,\\dots,M$, we want to \\emph{infer} the couplings:\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\bm \\sigma  \\rightarrow  \\mathbb{J} \n\\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\n With this purpose in mind,\n in the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the configurations, by Monte-Carlo simulations of the model. The joint probability distribution of the $N$ variables $\\bm{\\phi}\\equiv\\{\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_N\\}$, follows the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution:\n \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:p_xy}\n P(\\bm{\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}} \\quad \\mbox{ where } \\quad Z = \\int \\prod_{k=1}^N d\\phi_k  e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}}  \n \\end{equation}\n and where we denote $\\beta=\\left( 2\\Delta^2 \\right)^{-1}$ with respect to Eq. (\\ref{def:Z}) formalism. In order to stick to usual statistical inference notation, in the following we will rescale the couplings by a factor $\\beta / 2$: $\\beta J_{ij}/2 \\rightarrow J_{ij}$. \n The main idea of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability distribution of one variable $\\phi_i$ given all other variables, \n $\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}$:\n \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n\t\\nonumber\n   P(\\phi_i | \\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) &=& \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\exp \\left \\{ {H_i^x (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})\n  \t\\cos \\phi_i + H_i^y (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) \\sin \\phi_i }",
      "(\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases. The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}. With \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal. Otherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textcolor{red}{\nF: comment about quenched:",

After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions. The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables. The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value."

The philosophers who claim that we have free actions are called libertarians. The radical opposition that libertarians pose to the determinist position is their acceptance of free actions. Libertarians accept the incompatibility premise that holds agents morally responsible for free actions. Incompatibilism maintains that determinism is incompatible with human freedom. Libertarians accept that there are free actions, and in doing so, believe that we are morally responsible for some of our actions, namely, the free ones. The libertarian ONLY claims that we do have free will actions and affirm the incompatibility of determinism with free will. There is no claim here that free will is absolute, inviolable, and applies to every action and thus that people are \"self made at every instance. \"\nThus in the following it is clear you are burning an absurd strawman.

Therefore, coming down on people like a load bricks for any mistake is counterproductive. On the other hand, we would be foolish not to consider whether a person in question is showing any ability to learn from their mistakes. If not, a change of environment/circumstances is probably called for, even if today's prisons largely fail to be environment needed.

This is a free program and all are welcome.\nFiled Under: Old Lyme, Outdoors CT Legislators Support Study to Preserve Plum Island From Commercial Development March 28, 2016 by Jerome Wilson 1 Comment Aerial view of Plum Island lighthouse. (From Preserve Plum Island website)\nLast Thursday, March 24, at a press conference in Old Saybrook, a triumvirate of Congressional legislators from Connecticut, State Senator Richard Blumenthal and US Representatives Joe Courtney (D-2nd District) and Rosa DeLauro (D-3rd District) confirmed their support for a study to determine the future of Plum Island located in Long Island Sound. Members of the Plum Island Coalition — which has some 65 member organizations all dedicated to preserving the island — were in attendance to hear the good news. The island still houses a high-security, federal animal disease research facility, but the decision has already been taken to move the facility to a new location in Kansas with an opening slated for 2022. The current facility takes up only a small percentage of the land on the island and significantly for environmentalists, the remainder of the island has for years been left to nature in the wild. In supporting a federal study on the future of Plum Island, Sen. Blumenthal said, “This study is a step towards saving a precious, irreplaceable national treasure from developers and polluters. It will provide the science and fact-based evidence to make our case for stopping the current Congressional plan to sell Plum Island to the highest bidder.”",
      "Another method is to use burlap refuge/barrier bands wrapped around tree trunks so that migrating caterpillars will crawl into or under the folded burlap or be trapped by the sticky band. There are a number of crop protection chemicals labeled for the control of gypsy moth on ornamental trees and shrubs. There are treatments for egg masses, larvae and adult moths. Detailed information about these chemical treatments is available in the CAES factsheet.

The re-dedication ceremony, which will be held on the Boardwalk, will feature keynote speaker, Sen. Paul Formica, former First Selectman of East Lyme. Other speakers will include East Lyme First Selectman Mark Nickerson, Public Trust President Joe Legg, Public Trust Past-President Bob DeSanto, Public Trust Vice-President John Hoye, and Parks and Recreation Director Dave Putnam; all the speakers will recognize the many people who have helped made this dream a reality. The East Lyme Public Trust Foundation would like to invite the general public to witness this historic occasion. In addition, the members would especially like to encourage the participation of the 200 people who dedicated benches and the innumerable people who sponsored plaques. They would also love to welcome all members of the Trust – past and present – and all those who originally helped make the Boardwalk a reality. Participants should enter the Boardwalk at Hole-in-the Wall on Baptist Lane, Niantic. Then, there will be a short walk to the area of the monument where the ceremony will take place.",
      "He continued, “The stark truth is the sale of Plum Island is no longer necessary to build a new bioresearch facility because Congress has fully appropriated the funds. There is no need for this sale – and in fact, Congress needs to rescind the sale.” Congress, however, still has a law on the books that authorizes the sale of Plum Island land to the highest bidder. Therefore, opponents of the sale will have the burden of convincing Congress to change a law that is currently in place. Filed Under: Old Lyme, Outdoors, Top Story, vnn Land Trusts’ Photo Contest Winners Announced March 24, 2016 by admin Leave a Comment Winner of the top prize, the John G. Mitchell Environmental Conservation Award – Hank Golet\nThe 10th Annual Land Trust’s Photo Contest winners were announced at a March 11 reception highlighting the winning photos and displaying all entered photos. Land trusts in Lyme, Old Lyme, Salem, Essex and East Haddam jointly sponsor the annual amateur photo contest to celebrate the scenic countryside and diverse wildlife and plants in these towns. The ages of the photographers ranged from children to senior citizens. Hank Golet won the top prize, the John G. Mitchell Environmental Conservation Award, with his beautiful photograph of a juvenile yellow crowned night heron in the Black Hall River in Old Lyme. Alison Mitchell personally presented the award, created in memory of her late husband John G. Mitchell, an editor at National Geographic, who championed the cause of the environment. William Burt, a naturalist and acclaimed wildlife photographer, who has been a contest judge for ten years, received a special mention. Judges Burt; Amy Kurtz Lansing, an accomplished art historian and curator at the Florence Griswold Museum; and Skip Broom, a respected, award-winning local photographer and antique house restoration housewright, chose the winning photographs from 219 entries. The sponsoring land trusts – Lyme Land Conservation Trust, Essex Land Trust, the Old Lyme Land Trust, Salem Land Trust, and East Haddam Land Trust – thank the judges as well as generous supporters RiverQuest/ CT River Expeditions, Lorensen Auto Group, the Oakley Wing Group at Morgan Stanley, Evan Griswold at Coldwell Banker, Ballek’s Garden Center, Essex Savings Bank, Chelsea Groton Bank, and Alison Mitchell in honor of her late husband John G.

It begins at the level of physics in the distinction between the probability inherent in symbolic measurements and the certainty of material laws. The distinction is later exemplified in the difference between a genotype, the sequence of nucleotide symbols that make up an organism’s DNA, and phenotype, its actual physical structure that those symbols prescribe. It travels with us up the evolutionary layers to the distinction between the mind and the brain.” “These concepts will help us see how neural circuits are structures with a double life: they carry symbolic information, which is subject to arbitrary rules, yet they possess a material structure that is subject to the laws of physics.” Excerpt From: Michael S.

The question is not whether our experience is equivalent in every way to what lies outside of us, for such a thing is impossible. [A perception cannot be exactly the same as a material object, for the former depends upon a sentient being for its existence, whereas the latter does not. Further, it is impossible to know everything that may be predicated of any material object by merely perceiving it.] The real question is: Do sense impressions correspond to material objects in such a way that they are effective in preserving us from dangers that lie outside of us?",
      "There was no pussyfooting around for Pattee: “I have taken the point of view that the question of what constitutes an observation in quantum mechanics must arise long before we reach the complexity of the brain. In fact, I propose … that the gap between quantum and classical behavior is inherent in the distinction between inanimate and living matter. There you have it. Pattee proposes that the gap resulted from a process equivalent to quantum measurement that began with self-replication at the origin of life with the cell as the simplest agent. The epistemic cut, the subject/object cut, the mind/matter cut, all are rooted to that original cut at the origin of life. The gap between subjective feeling and objective neural firings didn’t come about with the appearance of brains. It was already there when the first cell started living. Two complementary modes of behavior, two levels of description are inherent in life itself, were present at the origin of life, have been conserved by evolution, and continue to be necessary for differentiating subjective experience from the event itself. That is a mind-boggling idea.”\nby mitchellmckain on April 24th, 2018, 1:06 pm\nThe \"like\" on the above post is not to be construed as complete agreement with conclusions, but rather more with an abundant approval of the questions and issues raised.

The one interpretation which makes this link and is not absurd is the Everett Interpretation. THOUGH, I would not count this in its favor! Furthermore, it isn't actually necessary to the Everett Interpretation, for it is quite possible to shift the locus of the decoherence in this interpetation to agree with other interpretations.

Furthermore, we have no way of knowing if these experiences represent 'real' objects, or are just simply products of illusion; hallucination, delusion, dream, mirage, etc. For this reason, solipsism is a possibility (i.e. it is just as plausible as it is not), and true self-awareness is not possible (i.e. we don't experience objects, including those called 'self') DragonFly wrote: There is no direct (literal) view of the actual reality 'out there'.

If A then B does not allow you affirm A, so by equating these two you have committed a logical fallacy. Furthermore it is amazing how far out on a limb you go to concoct such an attack. You said, \"we cannot know if everything is deterministic,\" which is utterly inconsistent with a clam that \"some is indeterminate,\" because if some is indeterminate then you would know that it is NOT deterministic.

The philosophers who claim that we have free actions are called libertarians. The radical opposition that libertarians pose to the determinist position is their acceptance of free actions. Libertarians accept the incompatibility premise that holds agents morally responsible for free actions. Incompatibilism maintains that determinism is incompatible with human freedom. Libertarians accept that there are free actions, and in doing so, believe that we are morally responsible for some of our actions, namely, the free ones. The libertarian ONLY claims that we do have free will actions and affirm the incompatibility of determinism with free will. There is no claim here that free will is absolute, inviolable, and applies to every action and thus that people are \"self made at every instance. \"\nThus in the following it is clear you are burning an absurd strawman.

      "Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point. National Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network. It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference.",
      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band. Past Personalities\n\nNotable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand.",
      "In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years. In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood.",
      "These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the \"Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio\"), Mitch Berg and others. The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years. But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication. (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann. Sports Radio\nKSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010. As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox. As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period. One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change. In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center. It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz. The original translator was discontinued. On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as \"SKOR North\" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, \"Skol, Vikings\"), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff.",
      "Station management cited the economic toll of the coronavirus for the changes. Sports broadcasting continues, primarily composed of ESPN radio network broadcasts. Sports Teams\n\nKSTP-AM served as the radio flagship for the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. On August 1, 2006, the station announced that it would be the new flagship station for the Minnesota Twins baseball team, effective with the start of the 2007 season. The Twins had been on rival WCCO since arriving in Minnesota in 1961. KSTP served as the flagship for the Twins until the end of the 2012 season, when games moved to 96.3 KTWN-FM (now KMWA). The Twins have since returned to WCCO 830. The switch to a fairly weak FM station caused dissent among some listeners, particularly in communities that had trouble picking up KSTP 1500. Although KSTP is the state's second most powerful AM station, it must operate directionally at night, delivering a reduced signal to parts of the market. WCCO, by comparison, offers a signal with a wider coverage area during the day than KSTP does, with WCCO's non-directional 50,000 watt signal. In response, the Twins have expanded the number of affiliates. On March 9, 2011, KSTP announced it would be the new flagship for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers men's and women's basketball and men's ice hockey, ending a 68-year run on WCCO. The rights have since moved to KFXN-FM, which already aired Gopher football. On March 2, 2017, KSTP announced it would be the first radio broadcaster for Minnesota United FC. The move brings live soccer action to 1500 AM.

      "Twelve women presented their research at this meeting with funding by the WCC/Eli Lilly Travel Grant Award. WCC members also spent time educating expo attendees on programs offered by the ACS Office of Diversity Programs at its new booth. In Chicago, the Younger Chemists Committee (YCC) welcomed its new committee members with an information session centered on YCC's charter as well as on its strategic plan: to make ACS relevant to younger chemists, to involve younger chemists in all levels of the society, and to integrate younger chemists into the profession. In January, YCC again hosted a Leadership Development Workshop during the ACS Leaders Conference. There were more than 80 applications for the 15 awards, which covered travel and registration for the conference. YCC plans to again fund the travel awards and provide leadership training for young chemists in 2008. YCC also solicited applications and selected a new graduate student representative on the Graduate Education Advisory Board. During the Chicago meeting, YCC programs included \"Starting a Successful Research Program at a Predominantly Undergraduate Institution,\" \"Career Experiences at the Interface of Chemistry & Biology,\" and \"Chemistry Pedagogy 101.\" In addition to these programs, YCC cosponsored five programs with various committees and divisions. YCC continues to reach out to ACS committees and divisions and has initiated liaisonships with 11 technical divisions to encourage technical programming that highlights the contributions of younger chemists. Looking forward to Boston, YCC is planning symposia including \"The Many Faces of Chemistry: International Opportunities for Chemists\"; \"Being a Responsible Chemist: Ethics, Politics & Policy\"; and \"Changing Landscapes of the Bio-Pharma Industry. \"\nThe Committee on Committees (ConC) conducted its annual training session for new national committee chairs at the ACS Leaders Conference in January 2007. ConC's interactive session for committee chairs in Chicago served as an opportune follow-on and a forum for informative interchange among seasoned and new chairs.",

      "Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.\nOsteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\nFunction in animals[edit]\nMechanism of action of vitamin K1. The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \"Gla protein\". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below. Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase.",
      "Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]\nPhylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone. A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain.",
      "Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency. Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]\nIn the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose. In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow."

Pumps raise the pressure of the oil and NGL before they start their journey to land. Two pumping stations – 37/4 A and 36/22 A ­– originally stood along the pipeline to maintain this pressure, but have now been disconnected and removed. The pipeline was installed with the ability to carry a million barrels per day. However, that much capacity has never been required. In the UK sector, a 24-inch pipeline has been tied in with a Y connection to receive input from several British fields – including the J block developments operated by ConocoPhillips. Output from the Greater Ekofisk Area is supplemented by crude from Valhall, Hod, Ula and Gyda heading for Teesside, optimising pipeline utilisation and thereby boosting value creation.

      "The problem with this approach arose when weather conditions meant the tankers had to cast off from the buoys because of strong winds or high waves. The rig then had to shut down production from the wellheads immediately. Given the weather conditions found on Ekofisk, output regularly had to cease. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason. Output began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day.

      "You can see the execution of the third experiment in the middle part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to perform robot to human handovers. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the vertical position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, the arm stays still, the human grasps the object from the bottom and slightly pushes it up, the hand then detects that there is a supporting surface and starts to slowly release the object. You can see the execution of the fourth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . This experiment is similar to previous one, but the grasp type that the robot uses is a pinch grasp, that involves only the thumb and the index finger. To perform this we only had to alter the grasp type conditional variable that was given to the posture mapping function. You can see the execution of the fifth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . In the first part (blue) of the experiment the robot closes its grasp, by reducing the grasp size, until the normal force is below the force offset. In the next three parts (pink, green, red) the person throws coins in the cup to increase its weight. You can see in the signal plots that each time coins are added the tangential force decreases so the normal force threshold decreases too. The grasp sizes then decreases as well in order to apply more normal force. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle perturbations in the weight of the object during grasping. CONCLUSION In summary, we presented a controller that uses force feedback integrated with conditional synergies to control a dexterous robotic hand to grasp and release objects. We demonstrated that our controller can lift objects of different weights and materials while avoiding slip, react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans.",

In point B in the Figure, you can see that there is noise in the tangential force, due to the arm moving to place the object on the table, that is also reflected in the desired normal force. Because we use the desired normal force as a threshold and not as a reference signal this noise is not manifested in the control of the grasp size. You can see the execution of the second experiment in the upper part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle arbitrary hand poses.

Our controller uses the conditional postural synergies framework to generate the grasp postures, i.e. the finger configuration of the robot, at each time step based on forces measured on the robot's fingertips.",
      "To choose between grasping or releasing an object we use a finite state machine formulation. When the hand reaches the desired grasp pose, which we assume is provided, the GRASP state is activated, in which the controller tries to grasp the object. When the controller detects that the tangential force applied to the object is coming from a support surface the state changes to the RELEASE state, in which the controller releases the object by opening the grasp. You can see the full algorithm in Python-like pseudocode in Figure . To summarize, the advantages of our controller compared with previous approaches are threefold: 1) instead of controlling each joint of each finger of the hand we use only two variables, the grasp size and the grasp type, which allows us to perform multiple grasp types by changing only one variable while the grasp size variable is common among all grasp types, that greatly reduces the complexity of the control process compared to independently controlling a 21 DoF hand to perform different grasp types, 2) we do not rely on slip prediction for controlling the desired normal force, which involves gathering labeled data and works only for the hand poses in the training dataset, and 3) we can use our controller to also release objects instead of only grasping them. Experimental Set-up. For our experiments we used the Seed Robotics RH8D Hand , which is a robotic hand with 7 DoFs. The hand is equipped with the FTS-3 force sensors in each fingertip, which are high resolution tactile sensors that provide the 3D force applied in each fingertip. The sensor provides data at a rate of 50Hz. For the experiments the hand was mounted on a Kinova Gen3 7DoF robot. To train the posture mapping function we used the CyberGlove to teleoperate the hand and collect 468 grasps belonging to three precision grasp  types: tripod, pinch, lateral tripod. The architecture of the cVAE model was the same as in , with the addition of the grasp type as a conditional variable, which was one-hot encoded.",
      "So when the error between the desired normal force and the actual normal force is large the grasp size decreases so tighter grasp postures are generated in order to apply more normal force. In practice, in order to avoid oscillations in the grasp size we use the desired normal force as a high threshold that we want the measured normal force to be below:\nIf the normal force is below that threshold the grasp size does not change even if there are small oscillations in the measured tangential and normal forces. Also, in order to avoid the hand applying too much force that damages the hardware or the object we use a low threshold, that is: where w threshold is the width of the threshold in mN . If the measured normal force is below the grasp size increases in order to apply less force. So the final grasp size variable for grasping is calculated as follows: where This is similar to the deadband control method , where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. If the response is in this range, the controller does not exert any correction. In our case, the operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. The grasp posture mapping function is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in . It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size. In this work we augment this model to also generate grasp postures conditioned on the grasp type. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate grasps based on more general characteristics such as the type and the size of the grasp. In this way we can control all the fingers jointly by a single value, the grasp size, thus greatly reducing the control parameters. In addition we are able to use the same control algorithm for different precision grasp types, by changing the grasp type conditional variable."

      "This yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix. We construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters. To determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ. Here γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2.

We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions.",
      "Essentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise. Therefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps . For example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a \"supercircuit\" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise. This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values. In superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.\nWe illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer.",
      "We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel. Results. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step . We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise. We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t. Depending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.",
      "All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) . Since γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser. Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps. This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising.",
      "This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser. In practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values. It should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser. Furthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor. Concretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond. The resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i ."

      "But in the Upper Room, Jesus is about to leave. He won’t be there to answer questions, to heal the sick, to right the wrong. And if He’s gone, so is the manifestation of the Father, and so is the Holy Spirit within Him. So what does a personal relationship with God look like when God leaves the building? First and most importantly, God hasn’t really left. Even though God incarnate has ascended into heaven, He did not leave us alone. The Holy Spirit is God’s special presence in this age. “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.” (John 14:16, 17 ESV) The same Spirit that indwells Jesus will indwell His disciples, and if we skip ahead to Acts, we can see that this Spirit of Truth indwells all believers. He is described as a Helper—which should come as no surprise from the God who just washed His disciples’ feet. And at least one aspect of His ministry is to point back to Christ. “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.” (John 15:26 ESV) But it’s not as though the Spirit is a consolation prize. Even though His ministry is all about Christ, Jesus seems to say the Spirit’s ministry will be better than His!—at least for the next phase of God’s plan. “Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.”",
      "(John 16:7–15 ESV) There’s a lot to unpack here, but first I just want you to notice: when we lost the Savior, we gained the Helper, and He’s exactly what we needed next. Even though Jesus fully paid for our sins, we need a Helper to teach us the perfect obedience that Jesus modeled, to realize the change that Jesus purchased for us. Now we get a fuller picture of what the Spirit of Truth has come to do. To the unbelieving world, He is a source of conviction, confronting sinners with the reality of who Jesus really was and what He did. To believers, He is a source of wisdom and knowledge. This is a ministry of words and truth. We usually call Him the Holy Spirit, which rightly emphasizes His character and the work that He does in our hearts, but He is also called the Spirit of Truth. He draws us back to the words Jesus spoke, which bear the Father’s authority. The Sanctifying Word\nThese days we’ve become cautious about putting our trust in words or staking claim to truth. We’re allowed to have our own truth, and we’re expected to have our own interpretations. But to go beyond this is to invite conflict. Some of us have also grown weary of knowledge because we’ve seen people devote themselves to a dead orthodoxy that devours truth and then does nothing with it. So we associate the Christian walk with a ministry of love and compassion and holiness—which it is—and try not to get too distracted by the rest. But it’s clear that Jesus spent a good deal of time ministering in words and teaching truth, and that the Holy Spirit is also committed to a ministry of words and truth. “Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me. These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” (John 14:24–26 ESV) When Jesus prays, He even emphasizes this before the Father: “Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.”",
      "We pursue truth in order to be sanctified. We are sanctified by the truth. When we talk about how we relate to God, our first thought is often the Cross, and that’s not wrong. Without Jesus’ work on the Cross we could have no fellowship with God. But even though it is what made a relationship with God possible, our relationship with Him goes much deeper. God is specially present in the world today by His Holy Spirit, Who indwells each and every believer. And the words of the Father have come by the Son and the Spirit to us in the form of the Bible. It is the Holy Spirit of Truth together with the Holy Words of God that mark God’s presence in our lives. They are what guide us and sanctify us. This is why we can’t get away from Scripture. This is why our relationship with God depends so much on our relationship with this book. Creation reveals God by what He has done, but it does not offer His words to us. The Church is united and empowered by the Spirit of God, but it cannot speak His words either. The Bible is how the Holy Spirit speaks to us; it is one of the means by which God has chosen to sanctify His people. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. The Story of Death (2/15/15)\nFebruary 18, 2015 Josh Vajda\t2 Comments\nIntro: The Matter of Life and Death\nDeath as Punishment\nDeath and God\nChinks in Death’s Armor\nFor Now We Wait\nClosing Thoughts: Ash Wednesday\nIntroduction: The Matter of Life and Death\nA friend once told me that Christianity is a “culture of death.” This was of course a reversal of Pope John Paul II’s 1995 condemnation of the modern culture of death, which sees the weak as useless at best—a burden to be eliminated. He pointed to the crucifixion, the Old Testament sacrificial system, and the way we seem to look forward to death so that we can go to heaven. In a strange sense my friend was right: Christianity has a lot to say about death, and sacrifice is central to our theology. Of course, in context Christianity is anything but a culture of death, but if we’re not careful we can definitely sound the way my friend described us.",
      "Jesus, being fully God, lives a perfectly sinless life—a life not meriting death—and dies on our behalf, paying for all the sin of the world. Let that sink in for a moment: God dies. But the death of God becomes the death of sin, and the death of sin becomes the death of death. And death’s final defeat is announced through the resurrection of God back from the dead. The God of life is alive! And He offers eternal life to all. As Tim Keller likes to put it, Jesus died the death we deserved so that we could live the life He deserved. Because Jesus submitted to death on our behalf, our relationship with death gets really complicated. It’s still the enemy. It’s still the wages of sin. It’s still not good. But every good thing—salvation, resurrection, eternal life, peace with God—these all came from one great death: the Crucifixion. So now all death is bad, but that one death brought us everything good. We praise the God of life, but we celebrate His death. God took a horrible, terrible, rotten, no-good thing and redeemed it. I suppose that shouldn’t surprise us either. We may sometimes look like we’re rejoicing in death itself, but really we rejoice in that one death that God used to bring eternal life. Our problem isn’t that we sing about death too much—we probably don’t sing about it enough! But we have to keep it in the context of the bigger story. We can’t make any sense of the Crucifixion apart from the Fall, the Resurrection, and Return of Christ. This is the theme we see in the Book of Acts: God raised Jesus from the dead. It’s all about resurrection now! We baptize in the likeness of His death—and resurrection. We take the bread and cup to remember His death—all the while waiting for His return. In Romans, death takes on a whole new meaning: since our sins were buried with Christ, we are now alive to God and dead to sin. Spiritual death is over now. Death has become just a metaphor for our relationship with sin. But make no mistake, death didn’t just die spiritually. We might think that because we still see death all around us."

      "When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out. At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.",

      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads.",
      "The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it. I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily. When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank.",
      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough."

      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band. Past Personalities\n\nNotable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand.",
      "Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point. National Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network. It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference.",

It shares clear-channel, Class A status on 1500 AM with WFED in Washington, D.C.  KSTP broadcasts a directional signal at night, using a three-tower array, with its transmitter on U.S. Route 61 at Beam Avenue in Maplewood. Programming is also heard on 250 watt FM translator K235BP at 94.9 MHz in Bemidji. History\n\nWAMD and KFOY\nKSTP's start in 1928 was the product of a merger between two pioneering Twin Cities stations: WAMD (\"Where All Minneapolis Dances\") in Minneapolis, first licensed on February 16, 1925 to Stanley E. Hubbard, and KFOY in St. Paul, first licensed on March 12, 1924 to the Beacon Radio Service in St. Paul. Following a few test transmissions, WAMD made its formal debut broadcast on February 22, 1925. (In later interviews Stanley Hubbard traced WAMD's start to April 1924.) It was located at the Marigold Dance Garden, and featured nightly \"Midnight Frolics\" broadcasts by the ballroom's orchestra. It is claimed that WAMD was the first radio station to be completely supported by running paid advertisements. Effective June 15, 1927, WAMD was assigned to 1330 kHz. On November 11, 1927 WAMD's transmitter site at Oxboro Heath on Lyndale Avenue South burned down, two weeks after the station had been sold to the National Battery Company. An initial arrangement was made to carry WAMD's programs over WRHM (now WWTC), transmitting on WAMD's 1330 kHz frequency."

      "This blog post was adapted from Pastor Megan’s sermon at Butner Federal Prison on January 25, 2015. The life of faith consists of seasons. One scholar suggests that we can categorize these seasons of life as seasons of being securely oriented, painfully disoriented, and surprisingly reoriented. These generalizations could apply to our self-acceptance, our relations to significant others, and our participation in public or private life. We might think about these seasons as passages of life, stages of growth, or even identity crises. Acknowledging where we find ourselves in a particular season can allow us to be honest about where we are at in our lives and where we are in relation to God. The Psalms, a collection of prayers, songs, and poems addressed to God, correspond to these seasons of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation. As we read through the book, we find Psalms where the writer is full of thanksgiving to God, securely oriented in life. We also find Psalms that demonstrate disorientation, perhaps categorized by loss, transition, grief, suffering, or even anger. Finally, some Psalms are written from a perspective of reorientation, wherein the Psalmist transitions from a period of being disoriented to being reoriented in relation to God and others. The Psalms can become our partner in prayer. Giving us words when we have none, we pray the Psalms joining with all those who have prayed them before us and all who will pray them after we are gone. As we pray the Psalms, we find permission to be utterly honest with God about our feelings and situation, free to speak openly and deeply to God about what we are experiencing. Praying the Psalms also helps us to envision God’s future when we can’t see it ourselves. Lastly, the Psalms guard us against religion or merely thinking about God. Using their words in prayer brings us into direct conversation with the living God, in language we may never have imagined would come from our lips. -Pray the assigned Psalm from the daily lectionary, with set Scriptures to read each day.",
      "This post was adapted from our sermon series on Interpreting Exodus. Pastor Megan preached this sermon at Butner Federal Prison complex on August 30, 2015. On Father’s Day 2015, we gathered for worship at the labyrinth in front of UNC hospital, having devoted the month of June to exploring the question, “What happens after we die?” Many have watched their father’s die in this place or other similar spaces. We shared in a time of both remembrance and prayer/meditation, participating in the ancient spiritual practice of walking the labyrinth. A labyrinth is a kind of maze, laid out in a circle. Tony graciously shared the following reflections from his experience at the labyrinth on the hot June day. It’s smaller than I expected, stark and hard‐surfaced, with no landscaping for ornamentation or shade. I don’t know what to expect from it… or from myself. But that’s part of the appeal. I stand at the entrance, hesitating, trying to clear my mind. This doesn’t work very well, so I just start walking. Almost immediately, the path presents itself as a linear and chronological symbol of my life’s journey. Like my physical lifetime, it has a beginning and an end, with an as‐yet undetermined amount between. This could be interesting. I like it so far… although I’m insecure about my style… and unsure about proper protocol. Is someone staring at me? Do I have to meditate? How slowly should I walk? Is it better to focus my thoughts… or to simply let them come? Will I control this thing, or allow it to control me? I begin to see each step as an increment of elapsed time, an irretrievable expenditure of life energy. I equate my initial discomfort to the natural immaturity of my childhood years. I gradually move beyond it, into metaphorical adulthood. This is much better. Most of the path is a series of gentle arcs. These are fairly easy to maneuver, like my comfortable life. But these segments are connected by intermittent sharp turns, mostly 180‐degree switchbacks. I see these as representing significant life changes or challenges, requiring more concentration and skill to negotiate."

      "Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. The CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}. The effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate. This process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}. The mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. In particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. The proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}. Moreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime: For QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}. Our main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening. Moreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.",
      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)].",
      "This is in contrast to the DQD system considered in Ref.~\\cite{part1},\nwhere only one of the quantum dots is proximized, such that \nCAR exchange cannot arise,\nand the Kondo physics becomes qualitatively\naffected only for $\\GS{}\\sim U/2$.%\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[bt]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Fig1.png}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Schematic of the considered system.

(h)-(j) present an example of RKKY process: an electron scattered off\n\t\t one QD (h) mediates the spin exchange towards the other (i), before it is finally scattered\n\t\t off there, too (j).\n\t\t }\n\\label{fig:system}\n\\end{figure} In this paper we discuss the CAR-induced Kondo screening in a setup comprising T-shaped DQD\nwith normal and superconducting contacts, see \\fig{system}(a). We note that despite quite generic character of CAR exchange,\nand its presence in systems containing at least two localized electrons\ncoupled close to each other to the same SC bath,\nto best of our knowledge CAR-induced screening\nhas hardly been identified in previous studies\n\\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9,IW_Kacper,IW_Sau,Zitko_Josephson,Zitko_S2QD,Martinek2017}. In the system proposed here [\\fig{system}(a)], its presence is evident. Moreover, CAR exchange magnitude can be directly related to the relevant energy scales, such as the Kondo \ntemperature, which provides a fingerprint for quantitative experimental verification of our predictions.",
      "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:Intro}\n\nThe exchange interactions control the magnetic order and properties of a vast number of materials\n\\cite{White2006Dec}\nand lead to many fascinating phenomena, such as various types of the Kondo effect \n\\cite{Kondo,NozieresBlandin,Pustilnik_Glazman}. Double quantum dots (DQDs), and in general multi-impurity systems, constitute\na convenient and controllable playground,\nwhere nearly as much different exchange mechanisms compete with each other to\nshape the ground state of the system.\n\\emph{Local exchange} between the spin of a quantum dot (QD)\nand the spin of conduction band electrons gives rise to the\nKondo effect \\cite{Kondo,Hewson_book}. \\emph{Direct exchange} arriving with an additional side-coupled QD may destroy it or lead to the \ntwo-stage Kondo screening \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia,Granger,ZitkoBonca,ZitkoPRB2010,Ferreira}. In a geometry where the two QDs contact the same lead, conduction band electrons \nmediate the \\emph{RKKY exchange} \\cite{RK,K,Y}. The RKKY interaction competes\nwith the Kondo effect and leads to the quantum phase transition of a still debated nature\n\\cite{Doniach,Jones,Affleck,Bork,Neel,KondoRKKYexp,Hans,Hans2,Fabian}. Moreover, in DQDs coupled in series also \\emph{superexchange} can alter the Kondo physics significantly\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx,Sela}. Recently, hybrid quantum devices, in which the interplay between various magnetic correlations\nwith superconductivity (SC) plays an important role, have become an important direction of research\n\\cite{hybridQDs,SCspintronics}. In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven \nto contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures\n\\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},\nwhile hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled \nelectrons propagating to separated normal leads \\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}. The latter is possible due to non-local (\\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),\nin which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and\nsubsequently to attached lead.",
      "Furthermore, for $|\\delta_1| \\sim |\\delta_2| \n\\sim \\delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx e^2/h \\cdot (\\delta/U)^2$,\nwhich is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \\fig{asym}(b)\nwith lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance\ncaused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependence,\nvisible in \\fig{asym}(b). Taking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather \nlarge, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages. Lastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \\emph{CAR} or\n\\emph{direct}, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \\fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect\nto sign change of $\\delta_1$, for \\emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. \n\n\\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}\n\\label{sec:x}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads, $G$, as a function of temperature, $T$,\n\t\t for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U/10$, for different values \n\t\t of asymmetry coefficient $x$ [see \\eq{xGS}], in the presence of \\emph{CAR} exchange only. %\n\t\t (b) The second-stage Kondo temperature $T^*$ normalized by $T_K$ as a function of $x$, \n\t\t calculated with the aid of NRG (points) and a fit to \\eq{Tstar} (lines) \n\t\t with $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from \\eq{Jeff}. %\n\t\t (c) The zero-temperature conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as a function of QD1 coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{1}$,\n\t\t compiled from data obtained at different circumstances (as indicated in the legend)\n\t\t for different $x$.

      "While these California studies address some of the limitations of earlier population studies, the pattern observed in California is expected to be different in other areas of the United States and the world. For example, Italians are underrepresented in this population when compared to the population of the East Coast of the United States. Determining prevalence figures for alpha thalassemia is even more difficult due to increased limitations in diagnostic testing. All types of alpha thalassemia disease are most common among people of Southeast Asian and Chinese descent, for reasons that become clearer with an understanding of the underlying genetics of alpha thalassemia. One study of 500 pregnant women in Northern Thailand estimated a frequency of one in 500 pregnancies affected by alpha thalassemia major, for example. Prevalence of alpha thalassemia disease is significantly lower in the United States primarily because of immigration patterns; although at least one state, California, has observed growing hemoglobin H disease incidence rates that are high enough to justify universal newborn screening for the condition. Humans normally make several types of the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin. An individual's stage in development determines whether he or she makes primarily embryonic, fetal, or adult hemoglobins. All types of hemoglobin are made of three components: heme, alpha (or alpha-like) globin, and beta (or beta-like) globin. All types of thalassemia are caused by changes in either the alpha- or beta-globin gene. These changes cause little or no globin to be produced. The thalassemias are, therefore, considered quantitative hemoglobin diseases. All types of thalassemias are recessively inherited, meaning that a genetic change must be inherited from both the mother and the father. The severity of the disease is influenced by the exact thalassemia mutations inherited, as well as other genetic and environmental factors. There are rare exceptions, notably with beta thalassemia, where globin gene mutations exhibit a dominant pattern of inheritance in which only one gene needs to be altered in order to see disease expression.",
      "Survivors passed the mutation onto their offspring, and the trait became established throughout areas where malaria is common. As populations migrated, so did the thalassemia traits. Beta thalassemia trait is seen most commonly in people with the following ancestry: Mediterranean (including North African, and particularly Italian and Greek), Middle Eastern, Indian, African, Chinese, and Southeast Asian (including Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Cambodian, Malaysian, Burmese, and Indonesian). Alpha-thalassemia trait is seen with increased frequency in the same ethnic groups. However, there are different types of alpha thalassemia traits within these populations. The frequency of hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major depends on the type of alpha thalassemia trait. The populations in which alpha thalassemia diseases are most common include Southeast Asians and Chinese (particularly Southern Chinese). It is difficult to obtain accurate prevalence figures for various types of thalassemia within different populations. This difficulty arises due to testing limitations in determining exact genetic diagnoses, as well as the fact that many studies have focused on small, biased hospital populations. Two studies reflect prevalence figures that can be helpful counseling families and determining who to screen for beta thalassemia. Between the years of 1990 and 1996, the State of California screened more than 3.1 million infants born in the state for beta thalassemia. Approximately 1 in 114,000 infants had beta thalassemia major, with prevalence rates being highest among Asian Indians (about one in 4,000), Southeast Asians (about one in 10,000), and Middle Easterners (about one in 7,000). Another type of beta thalassemia disease, E/beta thalassemia, was represented in approximately one in 110,000 births, all of which occurred in families of Southeast Asian ancestry. Among Southeast Asians, the prevalence of E/beta thalassemia was approximately one in 2,600 births. This is in keeping with the observation that hemoglobin E trait carrier rates are relatively high within the Southeast Asian population: 16% in a study of 768 immigrants to California, and up to 25% in some specific Southeast Asian populations such as Cambodians.",
      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts."

The latter technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and localization~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} offers a high potential for engineering a broad set of SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature. \\\\\n\\indent Here, we demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducting SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations. \\section{Experimental section}\n\nThe experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum.",
      "For the DV-SV case, clear curved stripe patterns oriented from bottom left to top right indicate again a stronger scattering strength for DV. Also, broader states are observed, indicating that the scattering strength of DVs and SVs is weaker in the valence band compared to the conduction band. \\\\\n\\indent More insight on the energy dependent scattering strength for each defect pair configuration can be obtained by extracting the wavevector $k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n})$ for each resonant state. This data set is plotted in Fig.~\\ref{num_data}(d) for the conduction and valence bands together with the $(16,0)$ dispersion relations calculated from the third-nearest neighbor TB model and from the ab-initio calculation for the pristine nanotube. A first observation is the excellent agreement between TB and ab-initio results, further validating the method used in Figs.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a)-(b) and ~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a). The vertical dashed lines indicate the limiting $k_\\mathrm{n,\\infty}=\\frac{\\pi \\cdot n}{L}$ values corresponding to the closed system (infinite hard walls potential) with $L=11.1$ nm being the defect-defect distance. In the conduction band, we find that $k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n})=\\frac{\\pi \\cdot n}{L_\\mathrm{eff}(n)} < k_\\mathrm{n,\\infty}$, indicating that the effective lengths $L_\\mathrm{eff}(n)$ of the QD are larger than $L$ ($i.e.$ the resonant states wavefunctions are characterized by penetrating evanescent modes inside the defect scattering potential), as expected for an open system. The shortest $L_\\mathrm{eff}(n)$ are obtained for the DV-DV configuration with 12.1 nm (m1), 13.1 nm (m2) and 12.9 nm (m3), which we attribute to wider scattering potential profiles for DVs compared to SVs. In the valence band, we find that $k_\\mathrm{n}(E_\\mathrm{n})=\\frac{\\pi \\cdot n}{L_\\mathrm{eff}(n)} > k_\\mathrm{n,\\infty}$, with $L_\\mathrm{eff}(n)$ values between 7.9 nm (DV-DV, m-1) and 9.66 nm (DV-SV, m-2). We attribute this pronounced QD shortening to wider scattering potential profiles of both DVs and SVs in the valence band, probably due to mixing with wide spread defect states in the valence band.",

      "This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV.

      "This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs. Our results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information. INTRODUCTION\n\nClinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , . Discharge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming. Researchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases. Therefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure.",
      "In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space. For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: • We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks. • We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. • We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries. In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - . Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either. Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.",
      "In this study, we focused on words, not entities, because we wanted to visualize expressions that are not only nouns. The words were segmented by MeCab with the J-MeDic. For each segmented word, the numeral and symbol labels were assigned as parts of speech by MeCab, the morphological analyzer, while the disease and symptom were assigned by the J-Medic dictionary. The results, shown in Figure , indicate that the encoded disease information leads to generate more proper disease and symptom words. This indicates that the meta-information successfully learns disease-related expressions. The encoded hospital or physician information also improved the precision of symbols generation. This suggests that different hospitals and physicians have different description habits (e.g., bullet points such as \"•\", \"*\" and \"-\", punctuation such as \"。\" and \".\", etc.), which can be grouped by meta-information. In this paper, we conducted a discharge summary generation experiment by adding four types of information to Longformer and verified the impact of the meta-information. The results showed that all four types of information exceeded the performance of the vanilla Longformer model, with the highest performance achieved by encoding disease information. We found that meta-information is useful for abstractive summarization on discharge summaries. Our limitations are that we used Japanese EHR, the limited number of tested features and not performing human evaluations. As for the efficacy of the meta-information, we believe that our results are applicable to non-Japanese, but it is left as Fig. . The precisions of words in the generated summaries. The vertical axis shows the probability that the words exist in the gold summary. a future work. Other meta-information may be worth verifying such as the patient's gender, age, race, religion and used EHR system, etc. It is hard to collect a large amount of medical information and process it into meta-information, so we may need to develop a robust and flexible research infrastructure to conduct a more large scale cross-sectional study in the future."

    "question": "Given the influence of environmental variability on the evolution of plasticity mechanisms in embodied agents, how does the interplay between the sensory and motor networks contribute to the emergence of diverse and robust learning rules compared to static agents, considering the potential for the motor network to interpret sensory information in multiple ways?",

    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "This additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure. The difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the \"correct\" values in any way. This is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways. Thus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.\n4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).",
      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.",
      "Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume. To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value. While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.",
      "The qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ]. Thus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold. These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously. Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions. The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red). In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food."

      "How Oxycontin, Florida and the Sackler Family Created the Opioid Crisis In America\nWhy are the Sacklers worth $13 billion today? Answer: “The Oxy Express Explained”\n(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)\nA COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING\nIn the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills. Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years. Of the country’s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies. 90 of 100 of the nation’s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country’s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn’t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time. Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida\nPurdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million. As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn’t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders.",
      "But on this front, Everett alleges that Purdue once again put profits over people. Obviously, this was ignored as the Florida based “Oxy Expres”; rolled on for years and years with np input, comment or oversight by Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family other than “show me the money” and enjoying a life of luxury on the misery created and managed in the Purdue Pharma boardroom. But, the Purdue boardroom isn’t the only guilty “Opioid Big Pharma” industry player who designed and supported the opioid prescribing crisis. For the current status of efforts to make Opioid Big Pharma accept responsibility in litigation filed in federal and state courts across the country, see: https://www.masstortnexus.com/Briefcases/254/OPIOID-CRISIS-BRIEFCASE-INCLUDING-MDL-2804-OPIATE-PRESCRIPTION-LITIGATION\nWhy Distributors Are Liable\nCardinal Health, one of the nation’s biggest distributors, sold two CVS pharmacies in Sanford a combined 3 million doses of oxycodone, flooding the town of 54,000 with an average of 250,000 oxycodone pills every month. West of Jupiter, a Walgreens drug distribution center sold 2.2 million tablets to a single Walgreens’ pharmacy in tiny Hudson, a roughly six-month supply for each of its 12,000 residents. It shipped more than 1.1 million pills to each of two Fort Pierce Walgreens pharmacies. For 40 days starting in late 2010, the distribution center shipped 3,271 bottles of oxycodone — 327,100 doses of the drug — to a Port Richey Walgreens pharmacy, prompting a distribution manager to ask: “How can they even house this many bottles?” There were 53 million oxycodone prescriptions filled in 2013 by US pharmacies, according to NIDA. This translates to approximately one bottle of this addictive drug for every 6 people in the country. How was this not noticed by those responsible for monitoring narcotics prescribing in the United States?

      "A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy ‘pot of gold’\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida’s role in feeding the country’s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies."

We note that despite quite generic character of CAR exchange,\nand its presence in systems containing at least two localized electrons\ncoupled close to each other to the same SC bath,\nto best of our knowledge CAR-induced screening\nhas hardly been identified in previous studies\n\\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9,IW_Kacper,IW_Sau,Zitko_Josephson,Zitko_S2QD,Martinek2017}. In the system proposed here [\\fig{system}(a)], its presence is evident. Moreover, CAR exchange magnitude can be directly related to the relevant energy scales, such as the Kondo \ntemperature, which provides a fingerprint for quantitative experimental verification of our predictions.",
      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)].",
      "The paper is organized as follows. In \\Sec{model} we describe the considered system \nand present the model we use to study it. In \\Sec{scales} the relevant energy scales are estimated\nto make the discussion of main results concerning CAR-induced Kondo effect in \\Sec{main} more clear. Finally, the influence of effects neglected in \\Sec{main} are presented in the following sections,\nincluding CAR exchange interplay with RKKY interaction (\\Sec{RKKY}), particle-hole asymmetry (\\Sec{asym}),\ncouplings asymmetry (\\Sec{x}) and reduced efficiency of CAR coupling (\\Sec{coef}). In summary,\nthe effects discussed in \\Sec{main} remain qualitatively valid in all these cases. The paper is concluded in \\Sec{conclusions}.\n\n\n\\section{Model}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe schematic of the considered system is depicted in \\fig{system}(a). It contains two QDs attached to a common SC lead. Only one of them (QD1) is directly attached to the left (L) and right (R) normal leads,\nwhile the other dot (QD2) remains coupled only through QD1. The SC is modeled by the BCS Hamiltonian, \n$H_{\\mathrm{S}}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\dag}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}-\\Delta\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}(a^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow}a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}^{\\dag}+a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow})$,\nwith energy dispersion $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, energy gap $2\\Delta>0$ and $a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$ annihilation operator \nof electron possessing spin $\\sigma$ and momentum $\\mathbf{k}$. The coupling between\nSC and QDs is described by the hopping Hamiltonian \n$H_{\\mathrm{TS}}=\\sum_{i\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}v_{\\mathrm{S}i}(d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}a^{}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}+h.c.)$,\nwith $d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}$ creating a spin-$\\sigma$ electron at QD$i$. The matrix element \n$v_{\\mathrm{S}i}$ and the normalized density of states of SC in normal state, $\\rho_{\\rm S}$, \ncontribute to the coupling of QD$i$ to SC electrode as $\\GS{i} = \\pi \\rho_{\\rm S} |v_{{\\rm S}i}|^2$. \nWe focus on the sub-gap regime, therefore, we integrate out SC degrees of freedom lying outside the energy gap \\cite{RozhkovArovas}.",
      "Furthermore, for $|\\delta_1| \\sim |\\delta_2| \n\\sim \\delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx e^2/h \\cdot (\\delta/U)^2$,\nwhich is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \\fig{asym}(b)\nwith lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance\ncaused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependence,\nvisible in \\fig{asym}(b). Taking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather \nlarge, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages. Lastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \\emph{CAR} or\n\\emph{direct}, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \\fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect\nto sign change of $\\delta_1$, for \\emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. \n\n\\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}\n\\label{sec:x}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads, $G$, as a function of temperature, $T$,\n\t\t for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U/10$, for different values \n\t\t of asymmetry coefficient $x$ [see \\eq{xGS}], in the presence of \\emph{CAR} exchange only. %\n\t\t (b) The second-stage Kondo temperature $T^*$ normalized by $T_K$ as a function of $x$, \n\t\t calculated with the aid of NRG (points) and a fit to \\eq{Tstar} (lines) \n\t\t with $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from \\eq{Jeff}. %\n\t\t (c) The zero-temperature conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as a function of QD1 coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{1}$,\n\t\t compiled from data obtained at different circumstances (as indicated in the legend)\n\t\t for different $x$.

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:Intro}\n\nThe exchange interactions control the magnetic order and properties of a vast number of materials\n\\cite{White2006Dec}\nand lead to many fascinating phenomena, such as various types of the Kondo effect \n\\cite{Kondo,NozieresBlandin,Pustilnik_Glazman}. Double quantum dots (DQDs), and in general multi-impurity systems, constitute\na convenient and controllable playground,\nwhere nearly as much different exchange mechanisms compete with each other to\nshape the ground state of the system.\n\\emph{Local exchange} between the spin of a quantum dot (QD)\nand the spin of conduction band electrons gives rise to the\nKondo effect \\cite{Kondo,Hewson_book}. \\emph{Direct exchange} arriving with an additional side-coupled QD may destroy it or lead to the \ntwo-stage Kondo screening \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia,Granger,ZitkoBonca,ZitkoPRB2010,Ferreira}. In a geometry where the two QDs contact the same lead, conduction band electrons \nmediate the \\emph{RKKY exchange} \\cite{RK,K,Y}. The RKKY interaction competes\nwith the Kondo effect and leads to the quantum phase transition of a still debated nature\n\\cite{Doniach,Jones,Affleck,Bork,Neel,KondoRKKYexp,Hans,Hans2,Fabian}. Moreover, in DQDs coupled in series also \\emph{superexchange} can alter the Kondo physics significantly\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx,Sela}. Recently, hybrid quantum devices, in which the interplay between various magnetic correlations\nwith superconductivity (SC) plays an important role, have become an important direction of research\n\\cite{hybridQDs,SCspintronics}. In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven \nto contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures\n\\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},\nwhile hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled \nelectrons propagating to separated normal leads \\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}. The latter is possible due to non-local (\\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),\nin which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and\nsubsequently to attached lead."

(From Preserve Plum Island website)\nLast Thursday, March 24, at a press conference in Old Saybrook, a triumvirate of Congressional legislators from Connecticut, State Senator Richard Blumenthal and US Representatives Joe Courtney (D-2nd District) and Rosa DeLauro (D-3rd District) confirmed their support for a study to determine the future of Plum Island located in Long Island Sound. Members of the Plum Island Coalition — which has some 65 member organizations all dedicated to preserving the island — were in attendance to hear the good news. The island still houses a high-security, federal animal disease research facility, but the decision has already been taken to move the facility to a new location in Kansas with an opening slated for 2022. The current facility takes up only a small percentage of the land on the island and significantly for environmentalists, the remainder of the island has for years been left to nature in the wild. In supporting a federal study on the future of Plum Island, Sen. Blumenthal said, “This study is a step towards saving a precious, irreplaceable national treasure from developers and polluters. It will provide the science and fact-based evidence to make our case for stopping the current Congressional plan to sell Plum Island to the highest bidder.”"

      "Hes yet another underclassmen with huge questions marks about his pro potential that will likely have to go to the Orlando pre-draft camp to show he is worthy of a first round pick. Made some great strides this year, but still has a ways to go, especially conditioning-wise. LeShawn Hammett 6-0, PG, St. Francis Junior No Undrafted Undersized combo guard played only 7 minutes in the mighty Northeast Conference before being suspended indefinitely for conduct detrimental to team. The NBA is clearly the only goal left for him to achieve. Brandon Heath, 6-3, PG/SG, San Diego State Junior No Second round pick? Streaky shooting combo guard Heath announced the he will test the NBA draft process this summer, and is hoping for an invite to the Orlando pre-draft camp. MWC player of the year; has a lot of wrinkles to his game that need to be ironed out before he can legitimately think about the NBA. Tedric Hill, 6-10, PF, Gulf Coast Community College Sophomore Yes Undrafted Ineligible to return to school after flunking out of college once again. Has bounced around over the past few years, and received some early hype from wannabe draftniks such as Gregg Doyel (CBS-Sportsline) and Sam Smith (Chicago Tribune) who compare him to Kevin Garnett. Very athletic we're told, but has absolutely no idea how to play the game. Has no chance of being drafted without an amazing showing at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Clarence Holloway 7-0, Center, IMG Academy (Prep School) 5th year High School No Undrafted Lone high school player in this years age-limit depleted draft. Former Louisville commit never got eligible for college and was always considered too slow and heavy to make much of an impact anyway. Reportedly lost weight and improved his grades this past year at IMG and is currently being recruited by UConn, Kansas State and Oklahoma, amongst others. Ekene Ibekwe, 6-9, PF, Maryland Junior No Undrafted Sources told DraftExpress exclusively that Ibekwe will be testing the waters. Likely only making this move because he can, as his chances of being drafted are very low.",
      "His stats are terrific, despite being the sole focal point of opposing defenses, and hes capable of scoring in a variety of ways, particularly with his jumper. Hes hoping for an invite to Orlando. Renaldo Balkman, 6-8, PF, South Carolina Junior No Undrafted After winning the NIT MVP award, Balkman has decided to see where he stands in the eyes of the NBA by testing the waters. Hes likely to find them downright freezing, as hes a skinny and undersized power forward with little to no skills who came off the bench for a very average team. Larry Blair,6-1, SG, Liberty Junior No Undrafted The 22 point per game scorer Blair is attempting to get some exposure for himself by testing the waters. Will Blalock, Iowa State, 5-11, PG, Junior No Second round pick? Declared for the draft together with Curtis_Stinson after Iowa States coach was fired. Size is a big question mark. Will likely hope to attend the pre-draft camp in Orlando and try to show scouts hes a 1st rounder. Likely returns for his senior year. Jahsha Bluntt, 6-6, SG, Deleware State Junior No Undrafted Puts up fairly average numbers (14.6 ppg, 41% FG) in one of the worst conferences in America. Looking for exposure at the Orlando pre-draft camp but its highly unlikely to receive it. Josh Boone, 6-10, PF/C, UConn Junior No First round pick? Boone announced hell be entering the draft without an agent. An up and down season has left his stock in the air, and will likely force him to prove himself at the Orlando pre-draft camp. Would greatly benefit from a productive senior season as an offensive focal point now that UConn has lost almost all of its firepower from last year. Ronnie Brewer, 6-6, PG/SG, Arkansas Junior No Lottery pick? After initially wavering a bit on his decision, Brewer announced hell be entering the draft without an agent in a press conference. Brewer is considered a likely late lottery pick to mid-first rounder pick, as his physical attributes and array of versatile skills on both ends of the floor are highly sought after.",
      "Pinnock will attempt to capitalize on his teams success this year by potentially attending the NBA pre-draft camp in Orlando. Pinnock will have to show better ball-handling and perimeter shooting ability than he did during the regular season. Leon Powe, 6-7, PF, Cal Sophomore No Second round pick Powe announced hell be testing the waters in a statement released by Cal. Where he ends up being projected depends heavily on how his knee checks out. Powe is already considered a serious tweener by NBA scouts, and had a hard time this season gaining back much of the explosiveness he had earlier in his career. Could realistically go undrafted should he decide to stay in. Richard Roby, 6-5, SG, Colorado Sophomore Likely Second round pick As first indicated by DraftExpress Roby has decided to test the waters. Disappeared against any major competition he went up against, particularly towards the end of the season. Roby will likely have to put on weight in the next few months and show off his perimeter stroke in the Orlando pre-draft camp. Sources tell us that he is on the verge of making a huge mistake by hiring an agent. Rajon Rondo, 6-2, PG, Kentucky Sophomore Yes First round pick As expected, Rondo has decided to enter the NBA draft, and has also hired an agent, Bill Duffy. Despite an inconsistent sophomore season, most scouts weve spoken to still had him as at least the #2 point guard on their board because of his intriguing upside. Workouts will be huge for him. Blake Schilb, 6-7, SG/SF, Loyola Chicago Junior No Undrafted Declared his intentions to enter the draft, without an agent, and is hoping for an invite to Orlando. Schlib is sorely lacking in the quickness and explosiveness departments that scouts demand from swingman prospects, but he makes up for it with his skill set to a certain extent. Regardless, sources tell us he wont be invited to Orlando, meaning he has to go back to school. Mustafa Shakur, 6-4, PG, Arizona Junior No Second round pick? According to the Arizona Star, Shakur will likely enter his name in the draft, without an agent.",
      "Athletic and long, but still lacking any type of polish. Donald Jeffers, 6-8, PF, Roxbury Community College Sophomore No Undrafted Anonymous junior college player. Alexander Johnson, 6-9, PF, Florida State Junior Yes First round pick? Sources told DraftExpress, that Johnson will be hiring an agent, mainly because he is already 23 years old. Hes considered intriguing because of his strength, raw offensive tools and freakish athleticism at the 4 position, and could work his way into the 1st round with strong workouts. David Johnson, 6-7, PF, Clinton Junior College Sophomore No Undrafted 6-7 JUCO power forward who averaged 2 points and 3 rebounds per game. Trey Johnson, 6-5, SG, Jackson State Junior No Undrafted Small school prolific scorer and one of the most accurate perimeter shooters in the country will attempt to draw some more attention to himself by testing the waters this summer. Johnson is hoping for a chance to prove himself in the Orlando pre-draft camp in June. Coby Karl, 6-4, PG/SG, Boise State Junior No Undrafted Son of Denver Nuggets head Coach George Karl put up nice numbers (17 ppg, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 39.5% 3P) in the underrated WAC conference. Had surgery in March to remove a cancerous lump from his thyroid. Mark Konecny, 6-10, Center, Lambuth (NAIA) Junior No Undrafted Transfer from Syracuse with mediocre production is looking for any type of exposure he can get before he graduates next season. Kyle Lowry, 6-1, PG, Villanova Sophomore No First round pick NCAA tournament performance showed that he definitely needs another year, but regardless, Lowry is in. For now its without an agent. Considering the lack of quality point guard prospects in this draft, Lowry is likely a first round pick. Says he will attend the Orlando pre-draft camp if invited. Aleks Maric, 6-11, Center, Nebraska Sophomore No Undrafted As exclusively reported by DraftExpress, Maric will be testing the waters. What may have played a role in this is the fact that the assistant coach that recruited him at Nebraska, Scott Spinelli, just moved on to Wichita State."

      "Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary. Seating is luxurious for one. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale. The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front. Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location. The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.",
      "Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd. This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites. Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.",
      "The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it. I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily. When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank."

Although only one social network server 101 is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple social network servers 101 may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature, for example, Google+. The common feature includes friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, such as those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph 179. In some examples, the social graph 179 reflects a mapping of these users and how they are related. In another embodiment, the channel application 103 b is stored on a third-party server 107, which is connected to the network via signal line 106. The third-party server 107 includes software for generating a website (not shown). In one embodiment, the notifying application generates a user interface that is incorporated into the website. Although only one third-party server 107 is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple third-party servers 107 may be present. In yet another embodiment, the channel application 103 c is stored on a user device 115 a, which is connected to the network via signal line 108. The user device 115 a is any computing device that includes a memory and a processor, such as a personal computer, a laptop, a smartphone, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), etc. The user 125 a interacts with the user device 115 a via signal line 110.

The network 105 may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In yet another embodiment, the network 105 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data such as via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, etc. While only one network 105 is coupled to the user devices 115 a, 115 n, the social network server 101, and the third party server 107, in practice any number of networks 105 can be connected to the entities. The channel application 103 receives data for generating a stream of content for a channel from heterogeneous data sources. In one embodiment, the channel application 103 receives data from a third-party server 107, a social network server 101, user devices 115 a, 115 n, a search server 135 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 136, an entertainment server 137 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 138, a ratings server 139 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 140 and an email server 141 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 142.

In one embodiment, the channel application 103 generates a model based on the data from the heterogeneous data sources, identifies a channel category based on a user's activities and historical trends, receives candidate content items that include the channel category from heterogeneous data sources, scores the candidate content items by comparing them to the model, and generates a stream of content for the channel.",
      "For example, the stream of content is derived from friends in a social network such as the social network application 109 or people that the user frequently emails. The more important that the person appears to be to the user, the more likely that the user will be interested in the candidate content item. Thus, in one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 applies a weight to candidate content items based on the social relationship of the user to the friend. For example, users that are friends receive higher weights than candidate content items from second generation friends of the user (i.e., a friend of a friend). In one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 receives information about relationships between users from the social graph 179. The collaborative filtering engine 217 increases the weights applied to candidate content items from friends when the user positively responds to the items. For example, if the user comments on the item or indicates that the user found the item interesting, the collaborative filtering engine 217 increase the weight so that more candidate content items from the friend become part of the stream of content. The user interface engine 260 is software including routines for generating a user interface that, when rendered on a browser, displays a channel generated for a user and enables the user to customize the channel.

      "To take into account the\nabsorbing column along the line of sight, the {\\em wabs} model with\nthe {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table (Wilms et al.\\ 2000) has been\nused throughout the paper. All the errors quoted in the present paper\nare 90\\% confidence intervals, unless otherwise stated. The rev.\\,1210 slew spectrum shows that the source is very soft, and\nappears consistent with a 63$_{-10}^{+12}$\\,eV black body, absorbed by\na hydrogen column density of\n8.2$_{-4.1}^{+5.4}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. The fit is good, with a\nP-statistic value of 0.11, obtained via the XSPEC {\\em goodness}\ncommand for this fit, based on 5000 random simulations. The best-fit\nhydrogen column is equal to the full Galactic hydrogen column in the\ndirection of the source (8.0$\\pm{1.1}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$; Dickey\n\\& Lockman, 1990, calculated via the FTOOL {\\em\n  nh}\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/fhelp/nh.txt}). The slew spectrum, plus the best fit simple black body model and the\ndeviations from the model, are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{slewspec}.

Simple power-law, thermal Bremmstrahlung, and other optically thin hot\nplasma models are unable to fit the spectrum adequately well. Given\nthat we later are able to identify the source as a nova (Section~5.2),\nthen the black-body model will likely be a good approximation. Furthermore, as we have obtained here a moderate number of slew\ncounts, the more physically realistic, though more complex atmosphere\nmodel for CO white dwarfs of MacDonald \\& Vennes (1991), provided by\nK.\\,Page (private communication), was attempted. This model, used\ne.g. to model the nova V1974 Cyg (Balman et al.\\ 1998), yielded a\nmarginal fit (and not formally a more statistically significant fit;\nP-statistic = 0.03, based on 5000 random simulations), with an\neffective temperature of 70$^{+8}_{-6}$\\,eV, an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.7$^{+3.2}_{-2.5}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$, and a PSF-corrected\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) flux of 4.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Note that a smaller $N_{\\rm H}$ (though perhaps\nstill consistent with the full Galactic hydrogen column) is now\nobtained using the white dwarf atmosphere model.",
      "Source spectra, containing single and double events, were extracted\nfrom the datasets from circles (none of the data were now piled up)\ncentred on the source position. An extraction radius, estimated from\nwhere the radial surface brightness profile was seen to fall to the\nsurrounding background level, was set to 30\\arcsec. Background spectra\nwere extracted from each cleaned dataset from a 40\\arcsec$-$80\\arcsec\\\nannulus centred on the source position. Point sources seen to\ncontaminate these larger-area background spectra were removed from the\nbackground spectra to a radius of 60\\arcsec. ARF files were created\nfor the source spectra, and were checked to confirm that the correct\nextraction area calculations had been performed. Finally RMF response\nfiles were generated. Standard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using\nXSPEC. Once again it was obvious that only a very soft model would fit the data; the only\nsimple model that was able to fit the data well (a P-statistic = 0.17,\nbased on 5000 random simulations) was a black-body model of\ntemperature $kT$=70$^{+3}_{-4}$\\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column\nof 6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$.

      "(Note that the\nMacDonald \\& Vennes (1991) ONe white dwarf atmosphere model was also\nattempted, but yielded a marginally worse fit than the CO white dwarf\natmosphere model; only the CO atmosphere model has been used in the\nsubsequent analysis). It is well known (e.g. Krautter et al.\\ 1996) that, because of the\nenergy-dependent opacity in the white dwarf atmosphere, fits to super\nsoft source novae spectra with black body models give larger fluxes\nand lower temperatures than atmosphere models fit to the same spectra,\nand this is seen in the present case. Thus the black body model\nrequires a larger $N_{\\rm H}$ to fit the same data than the atmosphere\nmodel, as is seen. The model normalizations, corrected for the removal\nof the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate\ndistance to the source. If we assume a typical emitting region for\nthe white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10$^{9}$\\,cm,\nthen, for the black body model, this distance turns out to be\n20$^{+31}_{-10}$\\,kpc. The effects discussed above however can lead to\nusage of the black body model giving rise to an underestimation of the\ndistance. For the white dwarf atmosphere model, a larger distance of\n71$^{+27}_{-23}$\\,kpc is obtained. Both estimates are consistent with\nthe distance to the LMC ($\\sim$50\\,kpc, see Section~6), and assuming a\ndistance of 50\\,kpc, the black body derived flux corresponds to a\n(pile-up corrected) 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity of\n1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 20 575 700,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f1.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton Slew spectrum of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from\n  XMM-Newton revolution 1210.

Though great care\nshould be taken in interpreting this result, as the black body model\nis possibly overestimating the luminosity, this obtained radius is\nstill consistent with that of moderately massive ($>$1.1$M_{\\odot}$)\nwhite dwarfs (Hamada \\& Salpeter 1961), i.e.\\,the whole white dwarf\nsurface may still be emitting at 59\\,eV.\n\n\\section{Dedicated XMM-Newton observations}\n\nWe were granted an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation,\nonce the source became again visible to XMM-Newton, and a 10\\,ks\nXMM-Newton EPIC observation was made on 19th June 2007 (see\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}). All the XMM-Newton EPIC data, i.e.  the data\nfrom the two MOS cameras and the single pn camera, were taken in\nfull-frame mode with the thin filter in place. These data from the\nthree EPIC instruments have been reprocessed using the standard\nprocedures in XMM-Newton SAS (Science Analysis System) $-$ v.7.1.0. Periods of high-background, of which there were very few, were\nfiltered out of each dataset by creating a high-energy 10$-$15\\,keV\nlightcurve of single events over the entire field of view, and\nselecting times when this lightcurve peaked above 0.75\\,ct s$^{-1}$\n(for pn) or 0.25\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (for MOS). This resulted in\n$\\approx$9.4(8.0)\\,ks of low-background MOS(pn) data. Details of this dedicated\nXMM-Newton observation, together with source position, and\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) all-EPIC combined (pn, MOS1, MOS2) detected source\ncounts, count rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.",
      "The\n  ratios of the data to the best fit model are shown in the lower\n  panel.}\n\\label{xmmspec}\n\\end{figure}\n\nGiven that, in this XMM-Newton ToO observation, we had obtained a\nlarger number of counts ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}$}$1500 over the 3 EPIC cameras), the\nphysically more realistic CO white dwarf atmosphere model (MacDonald \\&\nVennes 1991) was also attempted. This yielded a marginal fit (and formally\na no more statistically significant fit; P-statistic = 0.04, based on\n5000 random simulations), with an effective temperature of\n73$^{+3}_{-2}$\\,eV, and an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. Again, usage of the black body model results\nin a larger fitted $N_{\\rm H}$ and a lower fitted temperature than\nwith the atmosphere model. As before, the model normalization can be used to obtain a cautious\nestimate of the size of the emitting region. For the assumed distance\nof 50\\,kpc, then the black body model returns an emitting region\nradius of only 1.3$\\pm$0.2$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm. Again care should be\ntaken, as this may be an overestimation, the black body model having\nperhaps overestimated the luminosity. For the white dwarf atmosphere\nmodel, a smaller radius of 0.4$\\pm$0.1$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm is\nobtained. Note further that the assumption of a larger distance (see\nSection~6) would result in a proportionally larger emitting radius. The range in allowed radius therefore is quite large, and it is not\nimpossible for for the whole of the white dwarf surface to be emitting\nat 70\\,eV. If this is the case, then the white dwarf would have to be\nat the high end of the mass range ($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$; Hamada \\&\nSalpeter 1961). It may be the case then that we are at this point at,\nor close to the end of the SSS phase, where the effective temperature\nhas reached a maximum (Sala \\& Hernanz 2005), as is tentatively seen\nin the spectral fitting results, and where the photospheric radius has\nreached a minimum, close to the white dwarf radius.\n\n\n\\subsection{X-ray variability}\n\nThe full (XMM-Newton slew plus Swift-XRT plus XMM-Newton ToO)"

      "Hence, the data obtained for $\\phi$ ranging from $-30^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$ and $\\theta  \\in \\left[ {0^\\circ ,180^\\circ } \\right]$ covers the properties of conduction gap in all possible cases. In Fig. 5, we present the maps of conduction gap with respect to the strain and its applied direction in two particular cases: the transport is either along the armchair ($\\phi = 0$) or the zigzag ($\\phi = 30^\\circ$) directions. Both tensile and compressive strains are considered. Let us first discuss the results obtained in the armchair case. Figs. 5(a,b) show that (i) a large conduction gap up to about 500 meV can open with a strain of 6 $\\%$ and (ii) again the conduction gap is strongly $\\theta$-dependent, in particular, its peaks occur at $\\theta = 0$ or $90^\\circ$ while the gap is zero at $\\theta \\approx 47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\\theta \\approx 43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain. In principle, the conduction gap is larger if the shift of Dirac points in the $\\kappa_y$-axis is larger, as discussed above about Figs. 3-4. We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac points of graphene \\cite{kitt12} and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same $\\kappa_y$ in the two graphene sections.

(9), we find that the Dirac points are determined by the following equations:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  {\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} & =& \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{{t_1}{t_2}}}}, \\\\\n  \\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} &=& \\frac{{{t_1} + {t_2}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\\,\\,\\,\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} = \\frac{{{t_2} - {t_1}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhich simplify into ${\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ and, respectively, $\\cos \\left( {\\frac{{{\\kappa _x}}}{2}} \\right) = \\mp 1$ in the unstrained case. Hence, the zero conduction gap is obtained if\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{4{t_1}{t_2}}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{equation*}\nAdditionally, it is observed that the effects of a strain $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ are qualitatively similar to those of a strain $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$, i.e., the peaks and zero values of conduction gap are obtained at the same $\\theta$ in these two situations.",
      "In particular, the relationship for conduction gap peaks is approximately given by $\\theta = \\theta_A - \\eta_s \\phi$. For tensile strains, $\\eta_s$ takes the values of $\\sim 1.5667$ and $1.4333$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively. On the opposite, it is about $1.4333$ and $1.5667$ for $\\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\\circ$, respectively, for compressive strain cases. All these features are consequences of the rotation of Dirac points in the $k$-space with respect to the transport direction $\\phi$ as illustrated in the diagram on the top and the lattice symmetry of graphene. Finally, we investigate other junctions based on compressive and tensile strained graphene sections. The idea is that in this type of strained junction, the shifts of Dirac points are different in two graphene sections of different strains, which offers the possibilities to use smaller strains to achieve a similar conduction gap, compared to the case of unstrained/strained junction. In Fig. 7, we display the maps of conduction gap with respect to the directions of compressive ($\\theta_c$) and tensile ($\\theta_t$) strains in two cases of transport direction $\\phi = 0$ (armchair) and $30^\\circ$ (zigzag) for given strain strengths. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 7(a,b), with smaller strains $\\left\\{ {{\\sigma _c},{\\sigma _t}} \\right\\} = \\left\\{ { - 2\\% ,2\\% } \\right\\}$ or $\\left\\{ { - 1\\% ,3\\% } \\right\\}$, similar conduction gap of about 310 meV can be achieved (see Figs. 7(a,b)) while it requires a strain of 4 $\\%$ in the unstrained/strained junctions discussed above. However, since the shift of Dirac points is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strains and the transport direction, the properties of conduction gap are more complicated than in the latter case. In particular, our calculations show that the preferred transport directions to achieve a large conduction gap are close to the armchair one. Otherwise, the conduction gap is generally smaller, similarly to the data for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ compared to $\\phi = 0$, as shown in Fig.",
      "The relationship between these two transport directions can be explained as follows. On the one hand, based on the analyses above for $\\phi = 0$, we find that for a given strength of strain, a maximum shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis corresponds to a minimum along the $k_x$-one and vice versa when varying the strain direction $\\theta$. On the other hand, as schematized in the top of Fig. 6 below, the change in the transport direction results in the rotation of the first Brillouin zone, i.e., the $k_x$ (resp. $k_y$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 30^\\circ$ is identical to the $k_y$ (resp. $k_x$) axis in the case of $\\phi = 0$. These two features explain essentially the opposite $\\theta$-dependence of conduction gap for $\\phi = 30^\\circ$, compared to the case of $\\phi = 0$ as mentioned. Again, we found the same qualitative behavior of conduction gap when applying the strains of $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$. Next, we investigate the conduction gap with respect to different transport directions $\\phi$. We display a ($\\theta,\\phi$)-map of conduction gap for $\\sigma = 4 \\%$ in Fig. 6 and, in the top, an additional diagram illustrating the rotation of Dirac points in the $k-$space with the change in the transport direction. It is clearly shown that (i) a similar scale of conduction gap is obtained for all different transport directions, (ii) there is a smooth and continuous shift of $E_{cond.gap}-\\theta$ behavior when varying $\\phi$, and (iii) the same behavior of $E_{cond.gap}$ is also observed when comparing the two transport directions of $\\phi$ and $\\phi+30^\\circ$, similarly to the comparison above between $\\phi = 0^\\circ$ and $30^\\circ$. The data plotted in Fig. 6 additionally shows that $E_{cond.gap}$ takes the same value in both cases of $\\{\\phi,\\theta\\}$ and $\\{-\\phi,-\\theta\\}$ with a remark that the strains of $-\\theta$ and $180^\\circ-\\theta$ are identical. Moreover, the values of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, for which the conduction gap has a peak or is equal to zero, have an almost linear relationship.",
      "We remind as displayed in Fig. 2(a) that a finite bandgap opens only for strain larger than $\\sim 23 \\%$ and the zigzag (not armchair) is the preferred direction for bandgap opening under a tensile strain \\cite{per209}. We extend our investigation to the case of compressive strain and find  (see in Fig. 2(b) ) that (i) the same gap threshold of $\\sigma \\simeq 23 \\%$ is observed but (ii) the preferred direction to open the gap under a compressive strain is the armchair, not the zigzag as the case of tensile strain. This implies that the properties of graphene bandstructure at low energy should be qualitatively the same when applying strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma ,\\theta } \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma ,\\theta + 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. This feature can be understood by considering, for example, strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma , \\theta = 0} \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma , \\theta = 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. Indeed, these strains result in the same qualitative changes on the bond-lengths, i.e., an increased bond-length $r_3$ and reduced bond-lengths $r_{1,2}$. However, for the same strain strength, because of the exponential dependence of hoping energies on the bond-lengths, the compressive strain generally induces a larger bandgap than the tensile one, as can be seen when comparing the data displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). To conclude, we would like to emphasize that a large strain is necessary to open a bandgap in graphene. This could be an issue for practical applications, compared to the use of graphene strained junctions explored in \\cite{hung14}. We now go to explore the properties of conduction gap in the graphene strained junctions. In Fig. 3, we display the conductance as a function of energy computed from Eq. (5) using the Green's function technique. As discussed above, a small strain of a few percent (e.g., 4 $\\%$ here) can not change the gapless character of graphene, i.e., there is no gap of conductance in the case of uniformly strained graphene. However, similar to that reported in \\cite{hung14}, a significant conduction-gap of a few hundreds meV can open in the unstrained/strained graphene junctions.",
      "7. Additionally, it is shown that the preferred directions of applied strains in the case of $\\phi = 0$ are close to ${\\theta _c} \\equiv {\\theta _t} = 0$ or $90^\\circ$.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nBased on the tight binding calculations, we have investigated the effects of uniaxial strain on the transport properties of graphene strained junctions and discuss systematically the possibilities of achieving a large conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction and the transport direction. It has been shown that due to the strain-induced deformation of graphene lattice and hence of graphene bandstructure, a finite conduction gap higher than 500 meV can be achieved for a strain of only 6 $\\%$. Moreover, as a consequence of the shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis, the conduction gap is strongly dependent not only on the strain strength but also on the direction of applied strain and the transport direction. A full picture of these properties of conduction gap has been presented and explained. The study hence could be a good guide for the use of this type of unstrained/strained graphene junction in electronic applications.\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Acknowledgment.}} This research in Hanoi is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.02-1012.42.

      "Only this time the geopolitical stakes are infinitely greater than they were a century ago: control and domination of two-thirds of the world's hydrocarbon resources and thus the very fundament and energizer of the global economic system – oil and gas. The Bush Jr./ Obama administrations have already targeted the remaining hydrocarbon reserves of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia for further conquest or domination, together with the strategic choke-points at sea and on land required for their transportation. In this regard, the Bush Jr. administration announced the establishment of the U.S. Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM) in order to better control, dominate, and exploit both the natural resources and the variegated peoples of the continent of Africa, the very cradle of our human species. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated \"unlimited imperialism\" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all have in common an urge toward expansion which knows no rational limits, feeds on its own successes and, if not stopped by a superior force, will go on to the confines of the political world. This urge will not be satisfied so long as there remains anywhere a possible object of domination--a politically organized group of men which by its very independence challenges the conqueror's lust for power. It is, as we shall see, exactly the lack of moderation, the aspiration to conquer all that lends itself to conquest, characteristic of unlimited imperialism, which in the past has been the undoing of the imperialistic policies of this kind…. On 10 November 1979 I visited with Hans Morgenthau at his home in Manhattan. It proved to be our last conversation before he died on 19 July 1980. Given his weakened physical but not mental condition and his serious heart problem, at the end of our necessarily abbreviated one-hour meeting I purposefully asked him what he thought about the future of international relations.",
      "It is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. Even then I'm sure plenty fitting that description have faced the terror and torment enshrined into an institution that transforms the pride and enthusiasm of youth into a narrow zeal for dominating power relations. And we'll close with this from Francis A. Boyle's \"2011: Prospects for Humanity?\" (Global Research):Historically, this latest eruption of American militarism at the start of the 21st Century is akin to that of America opening the 20th Century by means of the U.S.-instigated Spanish-American War in 1898. Then the Republican administration of President William McKinley stole their colonial empire from Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; inflicted a near genocidal war against the Filipino people; while at the same time illegally annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii and subjecting the Native Hawaiian people (who call themselves the Kanaka Maoli) to near genocidal conditions. Additionally, McKinley's military and colonial expansion into the Pacific was also designed to secure America's economic exploitation of China pursuant to the euphemistic rubric of the \"open door\" policy. But over the next four decades America's aggressive presence, policies, and practices in the \"Pacific\" would ineluctably pave the way for Japan's attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 194l, and thus America's precipitation into the ongoing Second World War. Today a century later the serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III. By shamelessly exploiting the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001, the Bush Jr. administration set forth to steal a hydrocarbon empire from the Muslim states and peoples living in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf under the bogus pretexts of (1) fighting a war against international terrorism; and/or (2) eliminating weapons of mass destruction; and/or (3) the promotion of democracy; and/or (4) self-styled \"humanitarian intervention.\"",
      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society.",

What are you learning? BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, there was very dramatic, very hard-nosed testimony today on Capitol Hill from the top U.S. commander responsible for the U.S. involvement in Libya, saying that Gadhafi forces are becoming increasingly difficult to target, as they are using civilian vehicles, mixing in with local populations, moving next to mosques, schools, hospitals -- all the same tactics we saw for years in Iraq. And now, all of this today leading to a very dramatic exchange between General Carter Ham and one of the most vocal administration critics, Senator John McCain. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Hearing your testimony, General Ham, is almost an Orwellian experience for me. The fact is that if we had imposed the no-fly zone three weeks, four weeks ago, Gadhafi would not be in power today. The fact is that the situation on the ground is basically a stalemate. Would you say that the situation on the ground is a stalemate or an emerging stalemate?\nGEN. CARTER HAM, COMMANDER, U.S. AFRICA COMMAND: Senator, I -- I would agree with that if present on the ground. MCCAIN: So the goal -- our policy objective of the removal of Gadhafi is further from being achieved than it was three or four weeks ago. HAM: Senator, I -- I don't know that I would agree with that. What I -- because that, again, was not a military mission. The military mission of protecting, I think, was not wholly achieved, but achieved in large part. STARR: General Ham also acknowledging another problem -- a key U.S. aircraft, the AC-130, that flies low and slow to target on the ground, is facing what he called \"a significant threat\" from surface to air missiles, which he said remain effective and operational in some cases. And, Wolf, get this. General Ham says there were about 20,000 of those surface to air missiles when the campaign started and they are concerned that an awful lot of them are still out there -- Wolf.\nBLITZER:"

      "The second term corresponds to the second-order nonlinear forced response, which includes the sum frequency and difference frequency responses governed by λ ℓ + λ j . Eq. 26 straightforwardly offers visible information about the possible nonlinear vibrations by the cooperation of excitation frequencies. Particularly, consider a sinusoidal excitation f (t) = sin ω r t, which can be expressed as f (t) = γe λt + γ * e λ * t , where γ = −0.5i and λ = iω r . Substituting these values into Eq.\n26, the second term of Eq. 26 is simplified as where the first term is the difference frequency response, and the second term is the sum frequency response. Numerical studies\n\nIn practical engineering, some systems have an accurate equation of motion. Additionally, some systems have difficulty constructing their equations of motion because of complex nonlinear dynamic behaviours and uncertain system parameters. In this article, a system with a known equation of motion is called a known system, and a system with an unknown equation of motion is called an unknown system for simplicity. In this section, two numerical studies are presented. The first study verifies the proposed method using a known nonlinear oscillator, and the second study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown system. Throughout the numerical studies, the unit system is the metre-kilogramme-second (MKS) system; for conciseness, explicit units for quantities are omitted. A known nonlinear system\n\nThis study chooses a nonlinear oscillator written as: where mass m = 1, damping c = 1, linear stiffness k 1 = 10, quadratic stiffness k 2 = 20 and cubic stiffness k 3 = 20. It is a case that has been studied in a previously published article . The linear natural frequency of the system ω 0 = k 1 /m = 3.16 and the damping ratio ζ = c/(2mω 0 ) = 15.8%. This kind of oscillator occurs in many engineering problems, such as a model of fluid resonance in a narrow gap between large vessels . In the model, k 1 y represents the linear restoring force of the fluid, and k 2 y 2 and k 3 y 3 are respectively the quadratic and cubic nonlinear restoring forces of the fluid.",
      "Volterra kernel functions\n\nGenerally, the first several order responses dominate the total response of a system. Hence, the order of the Volterra series in Eq. 22 is chosen to be 3, namely, N = 3. For computing the first three order responses from Eq. 22, the first three order Volterra kernel functions need to be known. Since Volterra kernel functions and corresponding frequency response functions are related by a specific Fourier transform pair, we can first write the first three orders of frequency response functions directly from Eq. 28. Then, Volterra kernel functions are obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. Based on the harmonic probing algorithm , the linear frequency response function (LFRF) H 1 (ω), the quadratic frequency response function (QFRF) H 2 (ω 1 , ω 2 ) and the cubic frequency response function (CFRF) H 3 (ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ) are analytically given by:\nand Figures show H 1 (ω), H 2 (ω 1 , ω 2 ) and H 3 (ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ), respectively, which agree well with those reported in Ref. . As expected, the modulus of H 1 (ω) in Fig. peaks near the linear natural frequency ω 0 , and the phase angle decreases monotonically from 0 to -π with increasing frequency. Figure shows the sum frequency QFRF, where the energy converges along the line of ω 1 +ω 2 ≈ ω 0 . Therefore, when the sum frequency of a two-tone excitation equals the linear resonant frequency, the second-order response may reach its maximum. Additionally, those pairs of excitations in line ω 1 + ω 2 ≈ ω 0 may produce non-negligible vibration magnitudes due to second-order nonlinear effects. For the difference frequency QFRF in Fig. (b), the energy converges along two main lines, i.e., ω 1 ≈ ω 0 and ω 2 ≈ ω 0 . Figures show moduli of H 3 (ω, ω, ω) and H 3 (ω, ω, −ω), which are diagonal terms of the sum frequency CFRF and the difference frequency CFRF, respectively. While the modulus of H 3 (ω, ω, ω) peaks near ω ≈ ω 0 /3 and ω 0 , that of H 3 (ω, ω, −ω) peaks near ω ≈ ω 0 with a small hump around ω ≈ ω 0 /2. Values at ω ≈ ω 0 /3 and ω 0 /2 may be magnified by higher-order stiffness terms in Eq. 28."

In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive summary information about the event with the request for additional information. (e.g., a video clip of a portion or segment of the media asset, a textual description, etc.), which may help the plurality of users provide additional information. For example, in some embodiments, the media application may instead of (or in addition to) determining the context of an event, determine a particular portion of the event that would be needed for the plurality of users to provide additional information about the event. For example, the media application may use progress information associated with the progress of the media asset (e.g., line 506 (FIG. 5)) to determine at what point during the progression of the media asset the event occurred, and in response, transmit a portion of the media asset beginning ten second before that point and ending ten seconds after that point.

For convenience, S σ i is defined as We perform the CE expansion around the f σ ,seq . That is, the distribution function f σ i can be expanded as where ε is a coefficient referring to Knudsen number. The partial derivatives of time and space can also be expanded to Substituting the above four equations into Eq.\n(C.1), we can obtain (C.6) When retaining to ε terms, the following equation is obtained When retaining to ε 2 terms, we can obtain where M 2,αβ ( f σ ,(1) ) = ∑ i v iα v iβ f σ ,(1) i and M 3,1,α ( f σ ,(1) ) = .

We refer the EHEs derivation based on kinetic equation to as KMM. The necessity of the expanded part, the evolution equations of the relevant non-conserved moments, increases rapidly as increasing the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium. As the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium increases, the complexity will rapidly make KMM simulation studies, deriving and solving EHE, impossible.",
      "So that the values of continuous kinetic moments can be obtained from the summation form of kinetic moments. In this process, it requires the reserved kinetic moments, which are used to characterize the system behaviors, keep their values unchanged after discretizing the velocity space. Namely, f the reserved kinetic moments. According to the CE analysis, f can be expressed by f eq . Therefore, in the process of discretization, the reserved kinetic moments of f eq should keep their values unchanged, i.e., where i represents the kind of discrete velocities and α (α = x or y) is the direction in cartesian coordinate. To simulate the interaction between two different fluids, a two-fluid DBM should be constructed. Based on the singlerelaxation model, the discrete two-fluid Boltzmann equation can be written as : where σ represents the types of material particle and f σ ,eq i = f σ ,eq i (ρ σ , u, T). In two-fluid DBM, the macroscopic quantities of the mixture and each component are\nwhere ρ σ and u σ are the mass density and flow velocity of the component σ , respectively. ρ and u represent the mass density and flow velocity of the mixture, respectively. There exist two kinds of temperature (internal energy) definitions in two-fluid DBM because the definition of temperature (internal energy) depends on the flow velocity to be chosen as a reference. The first definition is by choosing the velocity of the mixture to be a reference, i.e., So that the expressions of temperature of component σ and mixture are where We can also choose the flow velocity of component as a reference, i.e., , where u σ is the flow velocity of component σ . The corresponding definitions of temperature for component σ and the mixture are\nwhere ∆E * I is It is clear to see that these two definitions of temperature for mixture are the same, but for temperature of component σ are different.

Simplification and modification of the Boltzmann equation\n\nAs we know, the collision term in the original Boltzmann contains high dimensional distribution functions. Therefore, the direct solution to it needs too much computing consumption. The most common method to simplify the collision operator is to introduce a local equilibrium distribution function ( f eq ) and write the complex collision operator in a linearized form, i.e., the original BGK collision operator − 1 τ ( f − f eq ), where τ is the relaxation time . The original BGK operator describes the situation where the system is always in the quasi-equilibrium state. Namely, it characterizes only the situation where the Kn number of the system is small enough and f ≈ f eq . The currently used BGK operator for non-equilibrium flows in the field is a modified version incorporating the meanfield theory description . Based on the above considerations, the simplified Boltzmann equation describing the SBI process is where the two-dimensional equilibrium distribution function is ) where ρ, T , v, u, I, R, and η are the mass density, temperature, particle velocity vector, flow velocity vector, the number of the extra degrees of freedom including molecular rotation and vibration inside the molecules, gas constant, and a free parameter that describes the energy of the extra degrees of freedom, respectively. The specific-heat ratio is flexible by adjusting parameter I, i.e., γ = (D + I + 2)/(D + I), where D = 2 represents the two-dimensional space.

      "They are all helpful to characterize the TNE strength and describe the TNE behaviors of a fluid system from their perspectives. But it is not enough only relying on these quantities. Besides the above physical quantities describing the TNE behaviors, in DBM modeling, we can also use the non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) to characterize the TNE state and extract TNE information from the fluid system. Fundamentally, four TNE quantities can be defined in a firstorder DBM, i.e., ∆ σ * 2 , ∆ σ * 3,1 , ∆ σ * 3 , and ∆ σ * 4,2 . Their definitions can be seen in Table , where v * i = v i − u represents the central velocity and u is the macro flow velocity of the mixture. Physically, ∆ σ * 2 = ∆ σ * 2,αβ e α e β and ∆ σ * 3,1 = ∆ σ * 3,1 e α represent the viscous stress tensor (or non-organized momentum flux, NOMF) and heat flux tensor (or non-organized energy flux, NOEF), respectively. The e α (e β ) is the unit vector in the α (β ) direction. The later two higher-order TNE quantities contain more condensed information. Specifically, and it indicates the flux information of ∆ σ * 2 . To describe the TNE strength of the whole fluid system, some TNE quantities contained more condensed information are also defined, i.e.,\nOther TNE quantities can be defined based on specific requirements. All the independent components of TNE characteristic quantities open a highdimensional phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive image for characterizing the TNE state and understanding TNE behaviors . It should be emphasized that: (i) The TNE strength/intensity/degree is the most basic parameter of non-equilibrium flow description; And any definition of non-equilibrium strength/intensity/degree depends on the research perspective. (ii) The physical meaning of D * m,n is the TNE strength of this perspective. (iii) From a certain perspective, the TNE strength is increasing; While from a different perspective, the TNE strength, on the other hand, may be decreasing.

      "In DBM modeling, the CE multiscale analysis is used to determine quickly the reserved kinetic moments. Specifically, when constructing a DBM which only the first order term of Kn number is retained (i.e., only the first order TNE effects are retained), seven kinetic moments should be reserved, i.e., the M 0 , M 1 , M 2,0 , M 2 , M 3,1 , M 3 , M 4,2 . Two more kinetic moments ( M 4 and M 5,3 ) are needed when the second order TNE is considered . However, it should be noted that the function of CE analysis in DBM modeling is only to determine the kinetic moments that need to be preserved. Whether or not to derive the hydrodynamic equations does not affect the DBM simulation. The kinetic moments used in our physical modeling are shown in the Appendix B. Their expressions can be obtained by integrating v and η with continuous-form f eq . For better understanding, the Appendix C gives the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations recovered from the Boltzmann equation. The kinetic moments in Appendix B can be written in matrix form, i.e., C • f σ ,eq = fσ,eq , (\nwhere C is the matrix of discrete velocity and feq represents the kinetic moments. A proper discrete velocity model is needed to confirm the values of f σ ,eq i . The f σ ,eq can be obtained by solving the inverse matrix, i.e., f σ ,eq = C −1 • fσ,eq , where C −1 is the inverse matrix of C. It is very convenient to obtain the inverse matrix of C through some mathematical softwares such as Mathematica, etc. The D2V16 model is chosen in this paper, its sketches can be seen in Fig. .

      "Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) used to show his displeasure towards those who wore ties. He used to tug at their ties and commanded them to abstain from wearing a tie. He also asked them to make Tauba from such acts. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always commanded Muslims to give or take anything with their right hand. He stopped the Muslims from calling the governments as their \"Sarkaar\" or leaders. He never kept any ordinary Kitaab on the books of Tafseer or Hadith. Whenever he sat in a Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) or Mehfil-e-Zikr, he always sat with utmost respect until the very end. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) never spat towards the Qibla. He never stretched his legs in the direction of the Qibla. Whenever he entered the cemetery, he never used his entire feet to walk on the ground. He always walked on his toes. At times, he would stand on his toes for about half an hour in the graveyard making Dua-e- Maghfirat! He always stopped Muslims from doing any false fortune telling. If any death or loss took place in the house of a Muslim, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would go to comfort the people of that house but he would never eat there. He always advised those in sorrow to make Sabr and remember Almighty Allah. He always respected Ulema-e-Ikraam. He respected the Sayeds in such a manner as a slave will respect his King. He prohibited Muslims from keeping un-Islamic names. He preferred such names as Abdullah, Abdur Rahmaan, Muhammad and Ahmad. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always performed his Salaah in Jamaah whether he was on journey or not. The moment he put his foot out of his house to go towards the Masjid, he used to be surrounded by his Mureeds (disciples) and well-wishers who would follow him till the Masjid door which was just a few feet away from his house. While some would be kissing his blessed hands, others tried to talk with him.",
      "When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior. \"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality. Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind\" but he was also known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam\" or The Grand Mufti of the World.",
      "His character was the true embodiment of the Sunnah of Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He shone like a star in the darkness of the night. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) possessed great heights of good character, moral standards, kindness, sincerity, love and humbleness. He never refused the invitation of any poor Muslim. He always stayed away from those who were very wealthy and lavish. He was the possessor of great moral and ethical values. It is stated that once Akbar Ali Khan, a Governor of U.P., came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) did not meet him but left to a place called Puraana Shahar (Old City) to visit a poor Sunni Muslim who was very ill and at the doorstep of death. In another occasion, Fakhruddeen Ali Ahmad, the President of a Political Party, came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but was refused this opportunity. Many other proud ministers had also come to meet Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but met with the same fate. This was due to his extreme dislike for politics and involvement in worldly affairs. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) never fell short in entertaining those who came to visit him. When he was physically fit he used go into the Visitors Section and ask each person whether they had eaten or not. He used to ask them if they partook in tea or not. He used to continuously enquire as to whether they were experiencing any difficulties or not. It was often seen that he would personally carry the dishes into the house for the visitors! He was definitely blessed with the characters of the \"Salfe Saliheen\" or The Pious Servants of Allah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a pillar of hospitality and humbleness. If he reprimanded a certain person for doing something un-Islamic or if he became displeased with anyone for some reason or the other, he used to also explain to the person in a very nice way and also try to cheer that person."

      "\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Joint Prediction and Perception}\nRSU starts predicting the RF signals it expects to receive from each vehicle based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) \\cite{9858012} that combines Particle filter (PF) and Kalman filter (KF) to perform temporal and hierarchical predictions. Since the acquired C-GDBN allows predicting a certain signal's dynamic evolution based on another's evolution, it requires an interactive Bayesian filter capable of dealing with more complicated predictions. To this purpose, we propose to employ an Interactive M-MJPF (IM-MJPF) on the C-GDBN. The IM-MJPF consists of a PF that propagates a set of $L$ particles equally weighted, such that $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}, \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(1)}\\}{\\sim}\\{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(1)}), \\frac{1}{L}\\}$, where $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}$, $l \\in L$ and $(.^{(1)})$ is the RF signal type. In addition, RSU relies on $\\Phi$ defined in \\eqref{interactiveTM_fromRFtoGPS} to predict $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)}$ realizing the discrete cluster of vehicle's trajectory starting from the predicted RF signal according to: $\\{\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)},\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}{\\sim} \\{\\Phi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(.|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(1)}), \\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(2)}\\}$. For each predicted discrete variable $\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t,l}^{(i)}$, a multiple KF is employed to predict multiple continuous variables which guided by the predictions at the higher level as declared in \\eqref{eq_continuousLevel} that can be represented probabilistically as $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$. The posterior probability that is used to evaluate expectations is given by:\n\\begin{multline} \\label{piX}\n    \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})=\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)},\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)})= \\\\ \\int \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) \\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)},\n\\end{multline}\nwhere $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)}){=}\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t-1}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t-1}^{(i)})$. \nThe posterior distribution can be updated (and so representing the updated belief) after having seen the new evidence $\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}$ by exploiting the diagnostic message $\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$ in the following form: $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}, \\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}) { =} \\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})$. Likewise, belief in discrete hidden variables can be updated according to: $\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}{=}\\mathrm{W}_{t,l}^{(i)}\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$ where:\n$\\lambda (\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\lambda (\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)}) {=} \\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)})\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{\\Tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)}|\\mathrm{\\tilde{S}}_{t}^{(i)})$.\n\n\\subsection{Joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection}\nRSU can evaluate the current situation and identify if V2I is under attack, or the satellite link is under spoofing based on a multiple abnormality indicator produced by the IM-MJPF. The first indicator calculates the similarity between the predicted RF signal and the observed one, which is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq_CLA1}\n    \\Upsilon_{\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}} = -ln \\bigg( \\mathcal{BC} \\big(\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}) \\big) \\bigg),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{BC}(.){=}\\int \\sqrt{\\pi(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}),\\lambda(\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}})d\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(1)}$ is the Bhattacharyya coefficient.",
      "In this work, we propose a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in the V2X network. A coupled generalized dynamic Bayesian network (C-GDBN) is employed to learn the interaction between RF signals received by the RSU from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. This integration of vehicles' positional information with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications allows semantic learning while mapping RF signals with vehicles' trajectories and enables the RSU to jointly predict the RF signals it expects to receive from the vehicles from which it can anticipate the expected trajectories. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \\textit{i)} A joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection method is proposed for the V2X scenario, which is based on learning a generative interactive model as the C-GDBN. Such a model encodes the cross-correlation between the RF signals transmitted by multiple vehicles and their trajectories, where their semantic meaning is coupled stochastically at a high abstraction level. \\textit{ii)} A cognitive RSU equipped with the acquired C-GDBN can predict and estimate vehicle positions based on real-time RF signals. This allows RSU to evaluate whether both RF signals and vehicles' trajectories are evolving according to the dynamic rules encoded in the C-GDBN and, consequently, to identify the cause (i.e., a jammer attacking the V2I or a spoofer attacking the satellite link) of the abnormal behaviour that occurred in the V2X environment. \\textit{iii)} Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the vehicles' trajectories from the predicted RF signals, effectively detect any abnormal behaviour and identify the type of abnormality occurring with high detection probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies the joint detection of jamming and spoofing in V2X systems. \\section{System model and problem formulation}\nThe system model depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_SystemModel}, includes a single cell vehicular network consisting of a road side unit (RSU) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{R}=[{x}_{R},{y}_{R}]$, a road side jammer (RSJ) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{J}=[{x}_{J},{y}_{J}]$, a road side spoofer (RSS) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{s}=[{x}_{s},{y}_{s}]$ and $N$ vehicles moving along multi-lane road in an urban area.",
      "More details on the setup can be found in \\cite{gutierrez2011frequency}. Fig. \\ref{fig_2} shows the real part of one of the channels, and the estimate of the proposed algorithm. The shaded area represents the estimated uncertainty for each prediction, i.e. $\\hat{\\mu}_k\\pm2\\hat{\\sigma}_k$. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD). \\hbox{Table \\ref{tab:table_MSD}} shows this steady-state MSD of the estimate of the MISO channel with different methods. As can be seen, the best tracking performance is obtained by standard LMS and the proposed method. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Opened Extensions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\n{We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios. Moreover, it has fewer free parameters than previous approaches and these parameters have a clear physical meaning. Finally, as stated in the introduction, one of the advantages of having a probabilistic model is that it is easily extensible:}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item If, instead of using an isotropic Gaussian distribution in the approximation, we used a Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix, we would obtain a similar algorithm with different step sizes and measures of uncertainty, for each component of ${\\bf w}_k$. Although this model can be more descriptive, it needs more parameters to be tuned, and the parallelism with LMS vanishes. \\item Similarly, if we substitute the transition model of \\eqref{eq:trans_eq} by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, \n\n\\begin{equation}\np({\\bf w}_k|{\\bf w}_{k-1})= \\mathcal{N}({\\bf w}_k;\\lambda {\\bf w}_{k-1}, \\sigma_d^2), \\nonumber\n\\label{eq:trans_eq_lambda}\n\\end{equation}\na similar algorithm is obtained but with a forgetting factor $\\lambda$ multiplying ${\\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}$ in \\eqref{eq:lms}.",
      "This proves that RSU learned the correct dynamic rules of how RF signals and trajectories evolve when the jammer and spoofer are absent (i.e., under normal situations). Also, we can see that the RSU can notice a high deviation on both the RF signal and the corresponding trajectory due to a jamming interference from what it has learned so far by relying on the abnormality signals. In contrast, we can see that under spoofing attacks, RSU notice a deviation only on the trajectory and not on the RF signal since the spoofer has affected only the positions without manipulating the RF signal. In addition, it is obvious how the proposed method allows the RSU to identify the type of abnormality occurring and to explain the cause of the detected abnormality (i.e., understanding if it was because of a jammer attacking the V2I link or a spoofer attacking the satellite link). \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{Results/trajectories_underJamming_andSpoofing}\n   \n    \\caption{Vehicle's trajectory under: normal situation, jamming and spoofing.}\n    \\label{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n        \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onRF}\n        \\\\[-1.5mm]\n        {\\scriptsize (a)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        \\begin{minipage}[b]{.92\\linewidth}\n            \\centering\n            \\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{Results/abnSignal_onGPS}\n            \\\\[-1.5mm]\n            {\\scriptsize (b)}\n        \\end{minipage}\n        %\n        \\caption{Abnormality Signals related to the example shown in Fig.\\ref{fig_exNormal_Spoofed_JammedTrajectories}: (a) abnormality indicators related to the RF signal, (b) abnormality indicators related to the trajectory.}\n            \\label{fig_abnormalitySignals_JammerSpoofer}\n    \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[height=3.2cm]{Results/Detection_Probability_RFfromGPS_versusPj}\n    \\caption{Detection probability ($\\mathrm{P_{d}}$) versus jammer's power ($\\mathrm{P_{J}}$) using different number of clusters $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$.}\n    \\label{fig_jammerDetectionProb}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]",
      "\\end{equation}\nAlso, we evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method in predicting and estimating the vehicles' trajectories and the expected RF signals by adopting the root mean square error (RMSE) defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n    RMSE = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\bigg( \\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}}_{t}^{(i)}-\\mathrm{\\tilde{X}}_{t}^{(i)} \\bigg)^{2} },\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $T$ is the total number of predictions. \\section{Simulation Results}\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method to jointly detect the jammer and the spoofer using extensive simulations.

      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads.",
      "When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out. At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees. You can also send me email at: mikemims@pacbell.net if you have any questions or want to share your ideas.

      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough."

      "The committee heard reports on letter-writing efforts by the ACS president to government officials in Libya and Mexico expressing concerns about challenges to the scientific freedom and human rights of scientists there. The Committee on Minority Affairs (CMA) approved new vision, mission, and values statements at the Chicago national meeting. The mission of CMA is to increase the participation of minority chemical scientists and influence policy on behalf of minorities in ACS and the chemical enterprise. An aggressive new strategic plan was approved by CMA to guide its activities over the next three years. By the end of 2009, CMA will increase the number of ACS Scholars that graduate to 100 per year, add 100 new minorities to leadership positions in ACS, engage in several collaborations, and increase the number of minority members of ACS by 5,000. CMA will focus initially on increasing minorities in ACS leadership. In working toward this goal, CMA began work on two new leadership-development programs for minority chemists. CMA continues to support the work of the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity (JSD) in developing programs, products, and services to ensure full participation of all members in ACS. In Chicago, JSD premiered a diversity booth at the meeting exposition hall and cosponsored symposia. The Committee on Patents & Related Matters (CPRM) discussed proposed legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. patent system as well as open-access legislation and the potential effects such matters might have on industry and academia as well as on ACS. CPRM also continued its work on several new educational tools to assist and inform members on patent issues and other intellectual property matters important to a successful career in the chemical enterprise. Many of these tools are now available on the committee's expanded website, membership.acs.org/C/CPRM/.\nAt the March 2007 meeting, the Committee on Professional Training (CPT) reviewed 42 new and additional information reports from ACS-approved chemistry programs.",
      "Task force members also commented on the recent Environmental Protection Agency Proposed Rule for Hazardous Waste in Academic Laboratories. Our Video Safety Resources Task Force is developing video resources to be distributed over the Web.\nCCS has been involved in collaborations for the updating of publications like \"Prudent Practices in the Laboratory\" and \"ACS Guidelines for the Teaching of High School Chemistry.\" Along with other ACS units, CCS is exploring participating in the EPA's School Chemicals Cleanout Campaign. The Committee on Chemists with Disabilities (CWD) met at the 233rd ACS national meeting, Chicago, on Monday, March 26. Judy Summers-Gates reported on the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity meeting. This subcommittee is made up of representatives of the five committees that support people in chemistry (as opposed to a category of the profession): CWD, Committee on Minority Affairs, Committee on Technician Affairs, Women Chemists Committee, and Younger Chemists Committee, and its goal is to develop ways to coordinate the efforts of the five groups. The CWD Ambassador Program that was announced at CWD's 25th anniversary celebration at the Washington, D.C., meeting was discussed. Zelda Wasserman reported on the status of the letter from CWD to the ACS Board regarding captioning of ACS video materials. Janelle Kasper-Wolf, of ACS staff, discussed adding new questions to the ACS annual employment salary survey to obtain information for the committee. At the Chicago national meeting, the Committee on Community Activities (CCA) partnered with the ACS Education Division and the Office of the President to host \"Chemistry In Action—It's Easy Being Green\" at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum on Saturday, March 24. More than 250 children participated in the hands-on activities focused on recycling. ACS President Hunt presented a Salutes to Excellence plaque to the museum for its dedication to community outreach. The Chemists Celebrate Earth Day celebration occurred in 120 local sections with 138 coordinators leading the efforts within their communities.",
      "This represents an increase of more than 30% in local section and coordinator participation from 2006. CCA was featured in C&EN's April 16th issue on page 53. A shortcut to CCA's homepage was created: chemistry.org/committees/cca.html. During the Boston national meeting, CCA and the Office of Community Activities will celebrate National Chemistry Week's 20th Anniversary and its theme, \"The Many Faces of Chemistry.\" A special outreach event is being planned for Sunday, Aug. 19. Hands-on activities will focus on health and wellness. The Committee on Corporation Associates (CCA) advises and influences ACS to ensure that its products and services are of value to industrial members and their companies. CCA vice chair, Roslyn White (SC Johnson), provided an overview of recent interactions between Corporation Associates and the U.K.-based Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). CCA gave feedback to a recommendations report from the ACS Board Committee on Professional & Member Relations Task Force on Globalization. Presentations were also received from the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and SCI. Staff reported on the Department of Industry Member Programs' activities since the San Francisco meeting. The report covered the Regional Industrial Innovation Awards, the World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology, the Analytical Pavilion sponsored by C&EN, and the ACS/Pharma Leaders Meeting. The Awards/Finance & Grants Subcommittee reported that CCA received two funding proposals that total $7,500. Funding was provided to the following: The Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs at $3,000 for the Chicago symposium on \"Benefits Trends for the Chemical Workforce\" and the Office of Graduate Education and the Department of Career Development & Management at $4,500 for a workshop on \"Preparing for Life after Graduate School,\" to be held in conjunction with the 39th Central Regional Meeting. The subcommittee also requested that ACS staff provide CCA with an official annual statement of Corporation Associates' financial reserves as of Jan. 1 of each year.",
      "CEI was also pleased to participate in the meeting theme on sustainability through the ACS presidential programming. CEI cohosted the Monday presidential luncheon to discuss sustainability issues with the Committee on Science and is leading the follow-up to that luncheon, which will include recommendations on advancing sustainability in the three focal areas of the meeting—energy, food, and water. The committee also continued its dialogue with the Committee on Corporation Associates about a collaborative workshop. This activity, tentatively slated for the New Orleans meeting, will seek additional insights from chemical and allied products companies about public policy barriers that limit adoption of more sustainable products and practices as well as policy incentives that would lead to increased sustainability in the chemical enterprise. At its Chicago meeting, the committee welcomed the president of the Jordanian Chemical Society and the past-president of the Arab Union of Chemists. The committee was briefed on Pittcon 2007, where, with financial support from the Society of Analytical Chemists of Pittsburgh, ACS coordinated participation of a scientific delegation from Adriatic nations. The committee heard reports on the 2007 Frontiers of Chemical Science III: Research & Education in the Middle East meeting; the 2007 Transatlantic Frontiers of Chemistry meeting, which was jointly sponsored by ACS, the German Chemical Society, and the Royal Society of Chemistry; planned workshops to engage U.S. and Chinese early-career scientists in chemical biology, supramolecular, and new materials chemistry; and ACS Discovery Corps U.S./Brazil Research Collaboration Project in Biomass Conversion to Biofuels, Biomaterials & Chemicals. The committee discussed Latin American engagement opportunities created through Puerto Rico's involvement in three key chemical science events there: the 2009 ACS Southeast Regional Meeting, the 2008 Federation of Latin American Chemical Associations (FLAQ) meeting, and the proposed IUPAC 2011 Congress & General Assembly."

      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D), D.C. DELEGATE: It's one thing to beat up on the District of Columbia. It's another thing drop a bomb on the city. And that's what this Congressional -- C.R. does. It takes the route of authoritarian governments and dictatorships by dictating to a local government how it may spend its local funds. And it may force the District of Columbia government to shut down, although our government had a balanced budget.\nBLITZER: And get this -- the members of Congress charged with reaching a deal, they'll still be receiving a paycheck if there's a shutdown, despite the hundreds of thousands of government employees who won't be receiving any paychecks. The current Congressional salary, by the way, $174,000 a year. Our CNN senior Congressional correspondent, Dana Bash, is up on Capitol Hill with the latest developments -- Dana, specifically, where are the sticking points right now?\nDANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, Wolf, this is effectively a bill to fund the government. And the sticking points certainly are about how much spending to cut. That's what this whole issue has been about. However -- however, one of the main issues, I am told, that were just -- that was discussed at the White House meeting this afternoon with the president, the House speaker and the Senate majority leader, was over not necessarily spending measures, but over lightning rod issues like regulating greenhouse gases and abortion. BASH (voice-over): One of the biggest disagreements is not over government spending, but policy. REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Some 40 or 50 policy restrictions that were attached to -- to our bill.\nBASH: So-called policy riders Republicans call essential and Democrats call nonstarters. The most divisive is over abortion. A GOP plan to cut all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion procedures in addition other women's health services. SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MAJORITY LEADER: This is a budget.",
      "She is joining us live in THE SITUATION ROOM to tell us why. Plus, no budget deal, no food -- the extreme tens of thousands of people are going to as a government shutdown looms. BLITZER: Let's get back to the outrage boiling over on Capitol Hill, only hours before a potential government shutdown. Joining us now, the Democratic delegate representing the city of Washington, D.C., Eleanor Holmes Norton. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D), D.C. DELEGATE: Of course, Wolf.\nBLITZER: I think it's fair to say that Washington, D.C., a city of a population of about 600,000 people, the only major metropolitan -- the only major city in the United States that's going to foal the direct impact of a federal government shutdown so dramatically, so powerfully, because it is a federal district. Give me an example of what's going to happen if there's a government shutdown.\nNORTON: Absolutely, although your viewers will be shocked by what they are about to hear. They know a little bit about taxation without representation -- we pay our taxes, then we have full representation in the House and the Senate. But I bet they didn't know that our local budget, without a dime of federal money in it -- and we support ourselves almost entirely -- has to be sent to the masters in the Congress to sign off on it before we can spend our own local money. Well, listen to this, Wolf. We passed our budget in -- last spring. The appropriators signed off on it last summer. So, why are we in a federal budget fight over their money when it is our money I am talking about? I have put forward amendments that said the district can spend its own local funds. BLITZER: What's going to happen in the District of Columbia Saturday, Sunday, Monday, if there is a government shutdown? Give me an example or two.\nNORTON: I will give you some dramatic ones. How about the shutdown of the D.C. government itself? Because since the final gavel hasn't fallen on all the federal appropriations, then the district government has now prepared to shut down on Saturday morning just because the federal government is shutting down.",
      "We are at the height of the tourist season, the Cherry Blossom Festival. That has been severely curtailed because of the federal shutdown. That's going to -- three million people come here just in one month for the cherry blossoms. Our mayor has had to put out a list of agencies that will be open and a list of agencies that won't be open.\nBLITZER: Trash collection -- will there be any trash collection in the District of Columbia?\nNORTON: No trash collection, and some residents have started up a Facebook page that says if they close down the District of Columbia, we're carrying our trash to Speaker Boehner's House.\nBLITZER: You don't support that do you?\nNORTON: I do not.\nNORTON: And let me just say right here, I do not. But let me tell you, I am only expressing a little of the rage that the taxpaying residents of the District of Columbia are feeling. BLITZER: But let me ask you this, Congresswoman, because the Democrats were in control, they had a large majority in the House all of last year; in the Senate, a significant majority. They failed to pass a budget. Don't the Democrats deserve a lot of the blame for this current impasse?\nNORTON: Absolutely not, because the Democrats would never have held our budget up here. LISA BLOOM, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Why didn't they pass the budget?\nNORTON: Well, that doesn't have anything to do with us. This is our local money. All it would take is -- the Democrats in the Senate are ready to agree. The president is ready to sign an amendment --\nBLITZER: But they could have done this any time last year.\nNORTON: Wait a minute, Wolf. Wait a minute -- an amendment that said while we're fighting it out on the federal budget, we will let the district spend its own local funds. So that's all I'm asking. I'm not in this fight, so don't ask me why the Democrats didn't pass the Democratic budget. I passed -- we passed our budget. Our budget is balanced. The only issue before the Senate and the House is, can we spend our local money? It doesn't have anything to do with their budget."

(D) Class distribution of repeat subfamilies belonging to differential expression clusters, compared to all genomic repeat subfamilies (first column). Class DNA includes DNA transposons; SINE includes Alu; LINE includes L1 an L2; LTR includes endogenous retroviruses and solitary LTRs; Satellite includes centromeric acrosomal and telomeric satellites; Others includes SVA, simple repeats, snRNA, and tRNAs. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enriched among repeats that are downregulated. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 (Fisher exact test). As shown in Fig 1C, the clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions, i.e. upregulation upon starvation and no change in regular medium (Cluster 1 and 2).",
      "In particular, a large fraction of ribosomal protein mRNAs is downregulated upon Met/Cys starvation (Fig 2A and 2C; S1 File), consistent with the notion that their genes–despite being scattered throughout the genome—are coordinately expressed in a variety of conditions . This reduced expression may depend on multiple pathways that control ribosome biogenesis in response to external stimuli, including the downregulation of Myc activity , the downregulation of mTORC1 [42, 44], or possibly the activation of the ISR, as described in yeast . By contrast, upregulated genes show a significant enrichment for transcription and gene expression (Fig 2B). Similar results were obtained by the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) database (S1 File), overall indicating a general downregulation of translation and metabolism, and upregulation of transcription, during the time interval of Met/Cys starvation corresponding to the transgene upregulation. Fig 2. Gene set enrichment analysis of Met/Cys-deprived HeLa cells. Differentially expressed genes between three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change of at least 2, leading to a total of 996 upregulated, and 1037 downregulated genes. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, using the EnrichR tool and the KEGG (A) and REACTOME (B, C) databases. Ranking is based on the combined score provided by EnrichR, and categories are displayed up to 20 items with an Adjusted P value <0.05. No significant categories were found with upregulated genes against the KEGG database. All data are shown in S1 File. The enrichment analysis using all differentially expressed genes together did not reveal any additional enriched process. To characterize the pathway leading to the reactivation of silenced transgenes, we used HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, as described . In addition, to test cell types relevant for AA metabolism, such as liver and muscle, we generated clones of HepG2 human hepatoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells, stably transfected with plasmids for OA1 and GFP transgenes, respectively (HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells; endogenous OA1 is not expressed in any of these cell types).",
      "Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it. The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells. Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1–3 μM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4–16 mM), either alone or in combination for 24–48 h, compared to full medium. Mean ± SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post-test vs. full medium). PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 μM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively. Specifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown).",
      "In particular, Cluster 1 contains sequences that, similarly to the OA1 transgene, are progressively upregulated upon starvation (Fig 1A and 1C) , while Cluster 2 contains sequences that are upregulated at early time points. Interestingly, repeat families that are significantly enriched in these two clusters belong mostly to the group of LTR-retrotransposons, including ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR and other LTR sequences (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). By contrast, DNA transposons (such as TcMar-Tigger) and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons are enriched among repeats that are downregulated during starvation, particularly at late time points (Clusters 3 and 4) (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). Consistent results were obtained by selecting significantly up- or downregulated genomic repeats (overall 181 species), based on their average expression out of three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h, when the transgene upregulation is more homogeneous) and controls, and on a P value <0.05 (S1B and S2B Figs). These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that—among major repeat classes—it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs. In addition, to obtain a general overview of main gene pathways changing their expression together with the transgene during AA starvation, we performed gene expression and enrichment analyses of regular genes, by considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Differentially expressed genes were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change between means of at least 2, and analyzed with the EnrichR tool . As shown in Fig 2 and S1 File, enrichment analyses against the KEGG and Reactome databases reveals a predominance of downregulated pathways, namely ribosome and translation, proteasome, AA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways related to mitochondrial functions, which are affected in Huntington, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)."

The channel engine 240 receives the stream of content from the scoring server 262 and generates the channel. The user interface engine 260 generates a user interface for displaying a user interface that includes the channel and transmits it to the user device 115. In addition, the user interface engine 260 generates a user interface to allow the user to customize the channel or define a new channel. These user interfaces are explained in greater detail below with regard to FIGS. 4-5. In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 transmits a query based on the channel category to the scoring server 262. The scoring server 262 queries and receives candidate content items from the data storage server 265. The scoring server 262 also queries and receives candidate content items from the social network server 101. The candidate content items from the social network server 101 are pre-scored by the collaborative filtering engine 217 and, in one embodiment, the unread candidate content items are saved to a cache on the social network server 101. These items are saved to a cache because the quantity of social updates can be large enough that performing the scoring during write time enables faster reads.

      "However, it came into management and strategic management literature as a research interest from the mid-1990s [29, 30]. Although business model had its roots in IS and ICT, the amount of research work on cyber security as a context is still quite negligible harnessing the potential of business model concept. The concept of business models lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, it can be observed as a bridge between abstract strategies and the practical implementation of strategic decisions and actions amidst the uncertainties of the modern business context [11–14, 31]. For instance, Zott and Amit  conceptualize business model as a ‘boundary-spanning’ set of activities aimed at creating and appropriating value. Morris et al.  viewed the concept of the business model as a set of decisions related to the venture strategy, architecture, and economics of firm (value creation and capture) that need addressing to create sustainable competitive advantage in the chosen markets and specific contexts. As a boundary-spanning unit of analysis, business models , connects an organization with its business environment, other organizations, customers, individuals and society as well; with the overall ecosystem at large [34, 35]. Trying to bridge business models and cyber security under current context, there are two core issues. First, as almost all of the entities operating within the digital sphere face multifaceted cyber threats, how can business model approach help organizations to respond to such situations? Second, how can business model approach help to identify opportunities and monetize security in future 5G? In the next two sub-chapters, we present two business model approaches that are suitable for ICT contexts, and, can help find answers to the above mentioned questions. As the mobile telecommunications industry advanced, so did business model related discussions in the literature about extending organizational boundaries through vertical and horizontal integration in industries .",
      "We will briefly open up the concept of MDM and IoT-MDM. The purpose of this study is to identify business potential for IoT-MDM service providers as cybersecurity vendor in the context of the future digital hospital. In doing so, we apply the concept of business model in order to make sense of a ICT-oriented business environment . Among various available conceptualizations, business model is considered as a boundary-spanning unit of analysis that explain the underlying business logic and the value creation and value capturing logic of an organization [11–15]. Traditionally, device management has been associated with management and configuration of handheld mobile devices , thus, mobile device management (MDM). Gartner  perceives MDM software to be a policy tool to configure and manage mobile handheld devices. They also mark that MDM services need to ensure security in reference to connectivity and content that is being transmitted. Along with surge of smart mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is growing large during the last few years and promises to flood the market with billions of devices in the coming years too . Zhang et al.  states scalability, transparency and reliability as important issues that differentiates IoT from the conventional Internet. To that end, there are several IoT platforms available currently in the market for managing, updating and configuring IoT nodes, e.g. IBM Bluemix, Cumulocity, ARM mbed OS, etc. . However, the transition raises the question about the differences and similarities between MDM and IoT device management as approaches. Takalo  marks MDM and IoT device management to be quite close on a conceptual level: both need solution for automated management of large device fleets consisting different form factors, device models, and operating system. Additionally, such systems conceptually needs to support various communication channels like: WiFi, cellular network and Ethernet. However, on practical level, MDM is more strictly controlled by operating systems and device vendors.",
      "Also, since this research is based on a conceptual phenomenon, thus its empirical validation, both qualitatively and quantitatively is still yet to come, which can be considered as a limitation of the study. All in all, we consider that applying a business perspective to IoT-MDM systems can solve many challenges of a modern mobile IT environment, not only in healthcare but also in other kinds of critical infrastructures . These IoT-MDM systems can be provided by various kind of vendors through a balanced and timely business model.

      "Though in this research, we adopt a high-level stance on cybersecurity from a technical perspective, the overall discussions on business potential are relevant to issues like information security, communication security, storage security, security at vulnerable touchpoints in hospital context (end user interface layer, IoT nodes, system layer, network layer). Futures digital hospitals will be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats because of its data-dependency and digital-intensive device network. Thus, the business opportunity for cybersecurity providers in this case can be considered as the need for automated and centralized IoT-MDM service. To that end, this paper presents four distinct players who can provide such service to a critical infrastructure like a digital hospital. The mixed-source business model options further open up multiple alternatives that each type of vendor can consider while tailoring services for the future digital hospital . This paper also connects the 4C ICT business model archetypes to cybersecurity business context which can be used as an analytical tool to identify customer needs and scope for value creation . Academically, this work contributes by filling up the void in discussing business models for cybersecurity as an industry. In addition, in the existing literature the hospital context has also been less discussed from a cybersecurity business perspective. From an industrial point of view, the business model options discussed in this research are timely and relevant to the market context and need. As mentioned, the mixed source business model options show how cybersecurity providers can extend their offering for different kinds of need for the hospital context based on their core businesses. This study can prove to be helpful for cybersecurity business entities and at the same time hospital managers. The scope of this paper explains business potential of cybersecurity vendors to an emerging industry from a higher level. In this paper, authors do not attempt to analyze the technical aspect of cyber security provisioning in healthcare context, however that is a forthcoming research possibility of this study."

As they reached the police barricade (erected to prevent them from chaining themselves to the gate, a plan they announced on their web site), the activists stood shoulder to shoulder, their bodies forming a human link across the 'picture postcard' tableau in front of the White House.\" Maria Chutchian (Arlington Advocate) quotes, participant Nate Goldshlag (Vietnam veteran) stating, \"\"There was a silent, single file march around Lafayette Park to a drum beat. Then we went in front of the White House,. There were barricades set up in front of white house fence. So when we got there, we jumped over barricades and were able to get right next to the White House fence.\" Participant Linda LeTendre (Daily Gazette) reports: At the end of the rally, before the silent, solemn procession to the White House fence, in honor of those killed in Iraq and Afghan wars of lies and deceptions, the VFP played taps and folded an American flag that had been left behind at a recent funeral for the veteran of one of those wars. Two attendees in full dress uniform held and folded the flag. I had the image of all of the people who stood along the roads and bridges when the bodies of the two local men, Benjamin Osborn and David Miller, were returned to the Capital District. I thought if all of those people were here now or spoke out against war these two fine young men might still be with us.",

It's always a man with Terry. Always. And somebody tell her that a snotty, snooty TV critic really doesn't make for good programming. This is C.I.'s \"Iraq snapshot:\" Thursday, December 23, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that \"war is not the answer.\" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, \"How is the war economy working for you?\"While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N. Environmental Sustainability Index on being most livable and greenest benefits. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead. The US military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent. Linda Pershing (Truthout) reports, \"Responding to a call from the leaders of Stop These Wars(1) - a new coalition of Veterans for Peace and other activists - participants came together in a large-scale performance of civil resistance.",
      "The demonstration, initiated and led by the ANSWER Coalition, broke the routine of holiday shopping and garnered support from activists and even passers by, who joined in chanting \"Money for jobs and education -- not for war and occupation!\" and \"Occupation is a crime -- Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine!\" Protesters held banners reading, \"U.S./NATO Out of Afghanistan!\" and \"Yes to jobs, housing and education -- no to war, racism and occupation!\"Speakers at the demonstration included representatives of Korean Americans for Peace, ANSWER Coalition, KmB Pro-People Youth, Veterans for Peace, Party for Socialism and Liberation and National Lawyers Guild. Tuesday, Nouri al-Maliki managed to put away the political stalemate thanks to a lot of Scotch -- tape to hold the deal together and booze to keep your eyes so crossed you don't question how someone can claim to have formed a Cabinet when they've left over ten positions to be filled at a later date. One group speaking out is women. Bushra Juhi and Qassmi Abdul-Zahra (AP) report, \"Iraq's female lawmakers are furious that only one member of the country's new Cabinet is a woman and are demanding better representation in a government that otherwise has been praised by the international community for bringing together the country's religious sects and political parties.\" As noted Tuesday, though represenation in Parliament is addressed in Iraq's Constitution, there is nothing to address women serving in the Cabinet. Aseel Kami (Reuters) notes one of the most damning aspects of Nouri's chosen men -- a man is heaing the Ministry of Women's Affairs. Iraqiya's spokesperson Maysoon Damluji states, \"There are really good women who could do wel . . . they cannot be neglected and marginalized.\" Al-Amal's Hanaa Edwar states, \"They call it a national (power) sharing government. So where is the sharing? Do they want to take us back to the era of the harem? Do they want to take us back to the dark ages, when women were used only for pleasure.\" Deborah Amos (NPR's All Things Considered) reports that a struggle is going on between secular impulses and fundamentalist ones."

      "At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third. He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK). English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.",
      "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash. In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.",
      "The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand. On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal. During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters. At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. Opposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017."

      "D) A mobile network operator bundling connectivity with IoT-MDM services as a proprietary package."

      "And, in other cases, they are selling the service through MNO’s bundled with connectivity and/or infrastructure. While as network infrastructure-driven security, a ‘mobile network operator/carrier’ or a ‘network infrastructure vendor’ can build own IoT-MDM system to offer their clients as well. And, finally, a location-specific micro operator can offer location-driven security. Micro operators offer mobile connectivity combined with specific, local services. The operation of a micro operator is spatially confined to either its premises or to a defined area of operation. As a part of the location-specific services, these micro operators can also offer IoT-MDM services for the users through outsourcing. Further, we attempt to connect the aforementioned classification and examples of different players offering IoT-MDM services with the mixed source business model approach. Table 2 summarizes our understanding on how each kind of cybersecurity provider can open and mix the core value creation logic for end users. As mentioned previously, the mixed-source business model options are: open source (open core, open extensions), open core (open core, closed extensions), open extensions (closed core, open extensions), and proprietary (closed core, closed extensions). In relation to these mixed-source options, we analyze the plausible options for each of the four distinct cybersecurity providers in the context of this study. Secure device manufacturer/provider Secure devices Proprietary (own device, own IoT-MDM platform), Open extensions (own device, outsourced IoT-MDM service). From a secure device manufacturer perspective, device business can be considered as the core operation whereas IoT-MDM services would be extended solution. A secure device manufacturer/provider can have either a proprietary model or an open extensions model. In the proprietary model, the secure device manufacturer will offer their own devices alongwith their own IoT-MDM system/service. This is a viable case in a sense that customers who are purchasing the fleet of secure devices might prefer the IoT-MDM service from the same vendor, which is ideally less risk prone.",
      "Generally, when a customer organization buys a fleet of secure devices, they would expect the device management functions to be offered by the same service provider since integration of multiple systems/interfaces might increase vulnerability and reduce the customer’s confidence on the system. However, in practice, not all secure device manufacturer will specialize in automated device management solutions, and new R&D expenses to develop the IoT-MDM systems could result to be financially unfeasible. So, the second option for a secure device manufacturer is to have an open extensions model, where they will still offer the secure devices but outsource the IoT-MDM services to other vendors. A micro operator’s core business relates to location specific network, while they are offering additional location specific services as extensions. Ideally, a micro operator’s business model in this case can be considered to be open source. At one hand micro operators are dependent on appropriate available spectrum resources on carriers and NIVs, and on the other hand, outsourcing the IoT-MDM services to other vendors seems more economically feasible than building own system. In contrast, a traditional IoT-MDM system/ service provider can have either a direct-open extensions business model or an indirect-open extensions business model. Unlike the other three archetypes in this discussion, IoT-MDM system/services are the core business for this kind of actor, as device and network related issues can be considered as extensions. An IoT-MDM system/service provider is characteristically dependent on connectivity providers, i.e. MNOs, NIVs. In a direct-open extensions business model, while they are selling the IoT-MDM service directly to the end users, they are using the operator connectivity, but delivering their core value directly. Alternatively, in an indirect-open extensions business model, these IoT-MDM vendors can sell the services through MNOs/NIVs/device vendors to the end users. Finally, a mobile network operator can either have an open extensions business model, or less likely a proprietary business model for IoT-MDM services.",
      "In an open extensions business model, operators will offer own connectivity to end users while outsourcing the IoT-MDM service to vendors. In very few cases though, operators might have their own IoT-MDM system on offering and thus they can sell both connectivity and IoT-MDM service as a proprietary bundle. Looking back at the case of futures digital hospital, it is deemed to comprise various advanced technology-aided devices, let it be for clinical purposes or communications purpose that support healthcare. With the presence of devices like smartphones, tablets, wearables, connected TVs, VR touchpoints, AR touchpoints, robotic assistance for surgeries, thousands of smart IoT devices, makes the overall device network of the digital hospital complex and need automated centralized management. This centralized management of numerous IoT and mobile devices can be delivered through IoT-MDM system/services. Using the IoT-MDM system/service, the hospital organization can configure, secure, and time-to-time update their device network. While procuring IoT-MDM services, the above analysis shows that futures digital hospitals can source it either directly from IoT-MDM service providers or through MNOs. Alternatively, if a digital hospital also plays the role of a micro operator, besides offering other location-specific services, the micro operator can also offer device management services by sourcing it from other vendors. In other cases, the future digital hospital can procure fleet of secure devices for the hospital from whom they can also source the device management service as a bundle. From the 4C business models perspective, the hospital organization seems to be a single organizational entity where different activities can be categorized in the 4C layers. Cybersecurity providers can specify and address such issues to highlight and customize their service offering for the future digital hospital. In this article, we have looked at the futures digital hospital context from a device management perspective, and attempted to portray business model options based on how to create and capture economic value from cybersecurity business.",
      "While these service provisioning scenarios are relevant to overall 5G, they are also significantly related to the case of IoT-MDM system/services. Figure 3 Scenarios for 5G cybersecurity provisioning [Adapted from 35]. As a result, we find four major drivers of security, which potentially will come with new business opportunities in the 5G era. Device driven security comprises distributed and D2D security techniques. Platform driven security will focus on centralized and D2D security techniques. Whereas, network infrastructure driven security should focus on centralized and infrastructure security methods. Lastly, location driven security should harness distributed and infrastructure security techniques. In a quest to identify potential business entities operating in each of the quadrants relevant to device management, we recognize a ‘secure device manufacturer/provider’ focuses on device-driven security. Currently, multiple device manufacturers are developing devices where security features are built-in, regardless of which network or websites the users are accessing. This built-in security can be offered to multiple kinds of devices including smartphones, tablets, pcs, wearables, and even to IoT devices with communication and computation capability. These secure devices are built in a way that it will control access to potentially harmful networks, websites, and content; even without any commercially available security applications installed. However, when a customer enterprise (e.g. the future digital hospital) is buying a fleet of hundreds of such secure devices, the question raises how to manage and configure all these devices from time-to-time. In such a case, even the secure devices will need IoT-MDM services for proper management and seamless upgrading when needed. For the platform-driven security, we observe a ‘traditional IoT-MDM system provider’ can be a good example. In many cases, IoT-MDM system providers are selling there device management systems to enterprises directly."

      "Generally, there are three kinds of physical modeling methods (or models) for SBI numerical research, i.e., the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic modeling methods. Most of the existing numerical researches on SBI are related to the macroscopic modeling methods (such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes (NS) models) based on the continuous hypothesis (or equilibrium and nearequilibrium hypothesis) . For example, presented the computational results on the evolution of the shock-accelerated heavy bubbles through the multi-fluid Eulerian equation . There also exist a few SBI works based on the mesoscopic modeling method, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method . The microscopic modeling methods such as the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is capable of capturing much more flow behaviors but restricted to smaller spatiotemporal scales because of its huge computing costs. In the numerical research on SBI, three points need to be concerned. (i) Investigation of kinetic modeling that describes the non-continuity/non-equilibrium flows. Most of the current researches are based on macroscopic models. However, there exist abundant small structure (and fast-changing patterns) behaviors and effects such as the shock wave, boundary layer, material defects, etc. For cases with small structures, the mean free path of molecules cannot be ignored compared to the characteristic length, i.e., the non-continuity (discreteness) of the system is pronounced, which challenge the rationality and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the continuity hypothesis. For cases with fast-changing patterns, the system dose not have enough time to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium state, i.e., the system may significantly deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Therefore, the rational-ity and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium (or near thermodynamic equilibrium) will be challenged. (ii) Improvement of method that describes the evolution characteristics of bubbles and flows morphology.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "Most of the studies describe bubble characteristics and flows morphology from a macroscopic view. The mesoscopic characteristics such as the kinetic effects which help understand the kinetic process, are rarely to be studied. (iii) Further studies of effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI process. The specific-heat ratio is an essential index for studying the compressibility of the gas. Research from Igra et al. has shown that the differences in the specific-heat ratio of bubbles would cause various wave patterns and pressure distribution inside the bubbles during the interaction process . Besides, many works on hydrodynamic instability have also demonstrated the importance of investigating the specific-heat ratio effect . Among these, Chen et al. investigated the specific-heat ratio effects on temperature gradient and the TNE characteristics of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) system . For the above three points, in this work we apply the recently proposed discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) . The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) research has two complementary branches . One aims to work as a kind of new scheme for numerical solving various partial differential equation(s). The other aims to work as a kind of new method for constructing kinetic model to bridge the macro and micro descriptions. The two branches have different goals and consequently have different rules. The current DBM is developed from the second branch of LBM and focusing more on the Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE) behaviors that the macro modeling generally ignore. It breaks through the continuity and near-equilibrium assumptions of traditional fluid modeling, discards the lattice gas image of standard LBM, and adds various methods based on phase space for checking, exhibiting, describing and analyzing the non-equilibrium state and resulting effects. More information extraction technologies and analysis methods for complex field are introduced with time. The numerical simulation includes three parts, as shown in Fig. .",
      "As a fundamental research method, theoretical research can provide a clear understanding of physical processes. In 1960, Rudinger et al. developed a theory that permits computing the response of bubbles to accelerations . In order to describe the formation and evolution processes of vortex structure quantitatively, many scholars have developed circulation models . However, theoretical works provide limited information. Meanwhile, in the late stage of SBI evolution, the bubble deformation and flow morphology dominated by the developed Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are difficult to be predicted accu-rately. As the research method closest to engineering application, the experimental results are often regarded as standard results to verify the rationality and accuracy of theoretical and numerical works. To study the SBI process accurately, the scholars have made a series of improvements to experimental equipment or technique, including the generation techniques of different types of shock waves, interface formation methods, schlieren facilities, and image recognition techniques . Among these, two of important and valuable works are performed by Ding et al.. Based on the soap film technique, they formed kinds of initial interfaces with different curvatures through the wire-restriction method and captured the wave patterns and interface evolution with high-speed schlieren photography . Other works, such as evolutions of a spherical gas interface under reshock conditions , developments of a membrane-less SF 6 gas cylinder under reshock conditions , and interactions of a cylindrical converging shock wave with an initially perturbed gaseous interface , are also performed by many other scholars. However, we know that the experimental studies mainly depend on the experimental platform. When studying some complex and demanding condition problems, it takes much work to build the experimental platform. In this situation, numerical simulation research becomes an option."

      "As each archaeological deposit is a unique occurrence, ensuring that the data resulting from excavation and analysis are preserved and accessible is crucially important. Currently, there is a general perception of a low level of data sharing and reuse. Such a low level of data availability would prevent the assessment of research findings and the reuse of data in meta-analysis (Kansa & Kansa 2013; Moore & Richards 2015). As observed across scientific disciplines, there is a major problem in the reproduction of scientific findings, commonly known as the ‘replication crisis’ (Costello et al. 2013). A range of intersecting debates contribute to this, including access to academic findings (open access), open data, access to software and access to methodologies, which can be broadly grouped as open science practices. Without these, the way that scientific findings can be verified and built upon is impaired. Questions of reproducibility have been raised in recent years in archaeology, with considerations of a range of practices which can improve the reproducibility of findings, and a recent call for the application of open science principles to archaeology (Marwick et al. 2017). Discussion has so far focussed on access to grey literature (Evans 2015), data sharing (Atici et al. 2013), data citation practices (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018) and computational reproducibility (Marwick 2017), with a focus on lithics, zooarchaeological evidence, and archaeological site reports. Quantitative assessments of current levels of data sharing, data citation and reuse remain limited in archaeology. The focus of evaluation has been on the uptake of large-scale digital archives for the preservation and dissemination of digital data, such as the Archaeology Data Service (ADS), utilised by developer-led and research projects, and recommended for use by many research funders in the UK (Richards 2002; Wright and Richards 2018). Much less focus has been paid to the data-sharing practices of individuals or small-groups of university-based researchers who may be disseminating their research largely through journal articles.",
      "So-called ‘grey literature’ results from the initial evaluation stage of developer-funded investigations and accompanying post-excavation assessment often contain a semi-quantitative evaluation of archaeobotanical samples on a scale of abundance. Whilst paper reports were initially deposited with county Historic Environment Records, a process of digitisation focussing on the Roman period has meant many pdfs are now available through the ADS (Allen et al. 2018), whilst born-digital reports are now deposited through OASIS (Online AccesS to the Index of archaeological investigationS), as part of the reporting process (Evans 2015), althought the extent to which specialist appendices are included is variable. These varying ‘publication’ strategies means archaeobotanical data is often available somewhere for recent developer-funded excavations and large-scale developer-funded excavations, even if much of this data is as a printed table or .pdf file (Evans 2015; Evans and Moore 2014). However, academic journals are typically perceived as the most high-status publication venue for archaeobotanical data, and a crucial publication venue for academics in order to comply with institutional requirements and the norms of career progression. Aside from the problem of access to pay-walled journals by those without institutional subscriptions to all journals, the publication of primary data alongside research articles faces various problems, from the outright lack of inclusion of data, to problematic curation of supplementary data and a lack of peer review of data (Costello et al. 2013; Warinner and d’Alpoim Guedes 2014: 155; Whitlock, 2011). The extent of these problems for archaeobotany is currently unknown. Given the growth in archaeobotanical data production as methodologies are introduced into many new regions and periods over the last decade, it is vital that we know whether the mass of new data being produced is made available and is being reused. Recent important advances within archaeobotanical data sharing have focussed on the construction of the ARBODAT database, developed by Angela Kreuz at the Kommission für Archäologische Landesforschung in Hessen.",
      "Recent work on the availability of data on lithics assemblages found a low level of data sharing (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018) and there are perceptions of low levels of data reuse (Huggett 2018; Kintigh et al. 2018). Within zooarchaeology numerous studies have explored issues of data sharing and reuse (Kansa & Kansa 2013, 2014), and the sub-discipline is seen as one of the most advanced areas of archaeology in regards to open science (Cooper & Green 2016: 273). Beyond zooarchaeology, however, explicit discussion has remained limited. This paper assesses data sharing and reuse practices in archaeology through the case study of archaeobotany – a long established sub-discipline within archaeology which has well-established principles of data recording. Archaeobotany is an interesting case study for data sharing in archaeology as it straddles the division of archaeology between scientific and more traditional techniques. Quantitative data on archaeological plant remains are also of interest to a range of other fields, including ecology, environmental studies, biology and earth sciences. The key issues of data sharing and data reuse (Atici et al. 2013) have been touched upon in archaeobotany over the past decade within broader discussions on data quality (Van der Veen, Livarda & Hill 2007; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). These earlier studies focussed on the quality and availability of archaeobotanical data from developer-funded excavations in Britain and Cultural Resource Management in North America (Vanderwarker et al. 2016: 156). However, no discussion of data-sharing and reuse in academic archaeobotany occurred. A recent review of digital methods in archaeobotany is the notable exception, with discussions of the challenges and methods of data sharing (Warinner & d’Alpoim Guedes 2014). Currently, we have no evidence for the levels of data sharing and reuse within archaeobotany. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of 1) data publication in recent archaeobotanical journal articles 2) data citation in recent archaeobotanical meta-analysis 3) the reuse of archaeobotanical datasets, in order to assess whether practices need to change and how such changes can take place.",
      "The production of an archaeobotanical dataset is very time-consuming, and interim publication on notable aspects of an assemblage may be considered as a necessary publication strategy. More broadly, one important aspect is issues of equity in access to digital archiving resources (Wright & Richards 2018), such as differential access to funds, training and knowledge. A recent study in Sweden found that we need to know concerns, needs, and wishes of archaeologists in order to improve preservation of archaeological data (Huvila 2016), especially when control of ones data may be linked to perceptions of job security. In order to make improvements in data sharing and reuse across archaeology, we need improved training in data sharing and the reuse of data in higher education (Touchon & McCoy 2016; Cook et al. 2018), improved training in data management (Faniel et al. 2018), and crucially, the necessary software skills to make the reuse of archived datasets attainable (Kansa & Kansa 2014: 91). Examples of good practice in archaeobotany are the Vaihingen and Gordion datasets which demonstrate how datasets can be archived in data repositories to accompany a monograph (Bogaard 2011b; Marston 2017b), whilst Farahani (2018) provides an excellent example of a journal article, where the primary data is supplied as a .csv in a cited data repository along with the R script for the analysis. In tandem with the need to encourage authors to share their data, is the need for journals to create and implement research data policies. Given the existence of research data policies in many of the journals included here, this reflects other findings of the poor enforcement of data policies by journals (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018), supporting arguments that journals should not be relied upon to make data accessible, and data should instead by deposited in digital repositries. In order to implement change in data sharing, there is a role to play for learned societies and academic organisation in lobbying funding bodies, prioritising data sharing in research projects."

      "I just want things to be able to sort themselves out in a much more equitable fashion. We have this enormous, artificial scarcity today over the means of communication, because the government awards licenses which self-perpetuate. They are about to do the same thing, and give every broadcast television station another license for HDTV. So if you've got a license today, you get a second one; if you don't have one, you get nothing. That is going to be our policy about HDTV. I think it would be a lot better if we had more markets, more choices, and better values. I don't know how to do better values, but we know how to do more choices. So the point is, we'll wind up with some new regime which I don't think that we can particularly predict. I don't think that it is going to be chaotic or anarchic. I think there is something about people as social animals or creatures -- we will create some new forms of social organization. There will be information middlemen; there will be the equivalent of editors and packagers. There will be trusted intermediaries who help organize these new media. If you open it up and equalize things so that everybody can participate, you will get more diversity of points of view, you will get less homogenization. One of the reasons that tons of people have just dropped out, or are in terminal couch-potato-dom is that the sets of choices and the values that come across the tube are not ones that stir the human heart. And people know that. They can't figure out what to do about that, so they sort of fuzz out on drugs and alcohol. I say let's edit TV, which is the electronic drug. Let's do something about that. DAVIES: I like your idea, Mitch. I think it's sweet. (laughter) The problem is that I really worry that the ultimate test of the future is going to be the outcome of the quest, the battle between those who are looking for the sort of vision you've got of the right of the individual, the individual being the producer. And that, probably, is the way we solve our problems on this planet.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "And I am talking about an economic restructuring that results in a much more decentralized society, and social restructuring in an affirmation of the simple right to be left alone. I think Cyberspace is good for individuals, and I think that's important. I also think that the flip side of the coin, the creation of community, which we so sorely lack in this country today, can be facilitated through these technologies. I have experienced that for myself, as many of you have on your various computer networks on conferencing systems like the WELL. It is enormously liberating to overcome the artificial boundaries of space and time. We are prisoners of geography in the physical world, and our communities are largely a product of who we can see face to face each day, even though our real comrades and colleagues may be scattered all over the world and our interests -- whether they are hobbies or political interests or religious interests, whatever they might be -- can be facilitated if we are able to get in touch with, to form bonds with, to exchange views and ideas with other kindred spirits. And I believe this technology is an enabling technology for the formation of community. My hope is that we will have the wisdom to create policies which enable individuals to flourish free from the chains of mass society, and which enable voluntary communities of people, individuals, groups who come together to be with each other and to work together. I hope both of those become possible. DAVIES: I feel very warmed by the various visions of the future that have come out of this conference, but I am a cynic, and cynicism is good, because it adds fiber. (laughter) How nice the world would be if everyone was like Mitch, but they're not, because the future is in the hands of ruthless, greedy little men. I want to paint the vision of the future that I have, and I hope it's not too depressing because there is a future, a good future... possibly. I agree, as many of you do, that the future is going to be like some giant informational Yggdrasil* *Reference from Old Norse mythology -- the Yggdrasil was a giant ash tree whose roots held together the universe.. We'll all be part of interconnectivity, the likes of which we can scarcely imagine right now.",
      "It's a debate and should be a debate about who does what best. It should be revised from time to time, but the important question is, If we get a significant distribution system like cable television, how should we classify it? I speak here from the heart, because 20 years ago, I was trying to fasten onto, or gain the recognition for, cable as a broadband distribution system which was only trivially in the program production and publishing business, but was very much in the distribution business and ought to have been treated as a common carrier open to all information suppliers. Had that happened, we would have been very much further along in the vision that some of us had 20 years ago. (applause) It tends to support what I said about not going in for premature freezing or characterization of how things look. It was decided, because the broadcasters felt threatened, to treat cable as a species of broadcasting. That's the greatest frittering away of resources in my lifetime, and perhaps in the lifetime of the United States of America. Let's not make that mistake again. Let's be clear-eyed and ask the broad-scale questions about public use and benefit. Thank you. LIASSON: Let's open it up to the audience. If you have any questions ... oh my God, wrestle your way to the microphone!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Let us not forget the history of the commons in which a wealthy society creates in its overflowing abundance structures on which all people can participate. This was originally, back in medieval society, the structure that was created for the support of the poor. In the abundance of the land in which the overpopulation was not a question, and there was much agriculture to go around, and the poor were supported out of the commonly-owned things that were jointly owned by all society. That's all I have to say. LIASSON: Who wants to start?\nDAVIES: Sticking to my apocalyptic vision just for the moment, because that's how I'm characterized, what I would like to see, just as my own social experiment, if you like, is for the various groups that this room represents and groups that you are all involved in, is to actually set up the apocalyptic vision, and then see how you as part of the information technology community can utilize it, stop it, or reverse it.",
      "And I think that -- I'm not espousing utopian vision -- there needs to be an utopian vision out there, so people have something to give them some inspiration. But values are a lot more important than technology. There are some values in this community -- and I'm not sure if it's an elite or a minority or both -- but it's really in the propagation of a sense of values about openness and tolerance, acting on that basis and living one's life, and saving capitalism from itself and things like that where we can make a difference. If some of the expressions are technological, that's fine. We are living in an era where people like buttons, and so on. If we do that well, the presidential candidates are going to be coming to us. LIASSON: You talk about Cyberspace not being ready for prime time -- I still want a definition of Cyberspace in 25 words or less -- but I think you want to transform prime time to a certain extent. DYSON: Mostly I agree with this, but the press does have two roles: one is collecting information and uncovering things, and the other is setting the agenda. If 12,000 voices are crying out, who's going to listen to them? Who's going to notice when they do discover that the President did something wrong? Again, it's a check and balance sort of thing, but there is a certain community that is created by collective media.\nKAPOR: Esther, what makes you believe that in Cyberspace Mara won't have two hours a day of her own that everyone listens to. (laughter) She might get more time than she gets today, because people trust her. DYSON: But then she becomes prime time. LIASSON: But you said before that instead of one global village, we have a lot of little global villages. I'm wondering if instead, we won't have millions of little huts. I mean individual huts. There are just so many different choices. LIASSON: What I'm wondering is, if everybody becomes their own producer, publisher, what does that mean for the future?

      "Although blood supplies in the United States are very safe, particularly relative to the past and to other areas of the world, there remains an increased risk of exposure to such blood-borne infections as hepatitis. Additionally, the body is not able to get rid of the excess iron that accompanies each transfusion. An additional medication called desferoxamine is administered, usually five nights per week over a period of several hours, using an automatic pump that can be used during sleep or taken anywhere the person goes. This medication is able to bind to the excess iron, which can then be eliminated through urine. If desferoxamine is not used regularly or is unavailable, iron overload can develop and cause tissue damage and organ damage and failure. The heart, liver, and endocrine organs are particularly vulnerable. Desferoxamine itself may rarely produce allergic or toxic side effects, including hearing damage. Signs of desferoxamine toxicity are screened for and generally develop in individuals who overuse the medication when body iron levels are sufficiently low. Overall, however, transfusion and desferoxamine therapy have increased the life expectancy of individuals with the most severe types of beta thalassemia major to the 4th or 5th decade. This can be expected to improve with time and increased developments in treatment, as well as for those with more mild forms of the disease. New treatments offer additional options for some individuals with beta thalassemia major. There are various medications that target the production of red blood cells (i.e. erythropoeitin) or fetal hemoglobin (i.e. hydroxyurea and butyrate). Their effectiveness in ameliorating the severity of beta thalassemia is currently being investigated. Another promising new treatment is bone marrow transplantation, in which the bone marrow of an affected individual is replaced with the bone marrow of an unaffected donor. If successful, this treatment can provide a cure. However, there is an approximately 10-15% chance the procedure could be unsuccessful (i.e. the thalassemia returns); result in complications (i.e. graft-versus-host disease); or result in death.",
      "Although transfusion therapy prevents many of the complications of severe anemia, the body is unable to eliminate the excess iron contained in the transfused blood. Over time, the excess iron deposits in tissues and organs, resulting in damage and organ failure. Another medication must be administered to help the body eliminate the excess iron and prevent iron-over-load complications. Beta thalassemia intermedia describes the disease in individuals who have moderate anemia that only requires blood transfusions intermittently, if at all. Alpha thalassemia is the result of changes in the genes for the alpha globin component of hemoglobin. There are two main types of alpha thalassemia disease: hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major. The two diseases are quite different from beta thalassemia as well as from one another. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease can experience events of hemolytic anemia—anemia caused by the rapid breakdown of the red blood cells. These events are thought to be triggered by various environmental causes, such as infection and/or exposure to certain chemicals. Hemoglobin H disease is in most cases milder than beta thalassemia. It does not generally require transfusion therapy. Alpha thalassemia major is a very serious disease that results in severe anemia that begins even before birth. Most affected babies do not survive to be born or die shortly after birth. The thalassemias are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Both alpha and beta thalassemia have been described in individuals of almost every ancestry, but the conditions are more common among certain ethnic groups. Unaffected carriers of all types of thalassemia traits do not experience health problems. In fact, the thalassemia trait is protective against malaria, a disease caused by blood-borne parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. According to a widely accepted theory, most genetic changes—mutations—that cause thalassemia occurred multiple generations ago. Coincidentally, these mutations increased the likelihood that carriers would survive malaria infection."

      "This sketching can help us significantly to identify which particular hand gesture is being performed in the time segment. \\subsubsection{EES Datasets: EDA and PPG Sensor Datasets} We used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed physiological signal processing approaches \\cite{picard01}. The dataset consists of measurements of four physiological signals (PPG/Blood Volume Pulse, electromyogram, respiration and Skin Conductance/EDA) and eight affective states (neutral, anger, hate, grief, love, romantic love, joy, and reverence). The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study. \\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}\nThough no frameworks ever combined all modalities together into real-time automated cognitive health assessment, we evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For hand gesture and postural activity recognition, we consider \\cite{alam17} proposed method as baseline. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network \\cite{zhu12} framework. For activity performance estimation, activity performance based cognitive health assessment; and EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment, we have considered \\cite{alam16} proposed method as baseline. \\subsection{Activity Recognition Evaluation}\nThe standard definition for \\emph{accuracy} in any classification problem is $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ where $TP,TN,FP$ and $FN$ are defined as true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. For complex activity recognition evaluation, we additionally consider \\emph{start/end duration error} as performance metric that can be explained as follows: consider that the true duration of ``cooking'' is 30 minutes (10:05 AM - 10:35 AM) and our algorithm predicts 29 minutes (10.10 - to 10.39 AM).",
      "\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures.

      "Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults. \\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation} In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity.",
      "We validate and compare \\emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets. \\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation} For collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent.

Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \\emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability. We follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario.

      "The minimax optimal convergence rate for nonparametric estimators of Hölder continuous spectral densities from Gaussian stationary time series was obtained by under the L p , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, norm. Only few works on spectral density estimation show the optimality of the corresponding estimators. In particular, and derived convergence rates of their estimators for the log-spectral density under the L 2 norm, while neglecting the Whittle likelihood approximation error. In general, most works on spectral density estimation do not exploit further the close connection to the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation. In particular, an upper bound for the L ∞ risk of a spectral density estimator automatically provides an upper bound for the risk of the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator under the spectral norm. This fact is used to establish the minimax optimality of our nonparametric estimator for the Toeplitz covariance matrices. The main contribution of this work is to show that our proposed spectral density estimator is not only numerically very efficient, but also achieves the minimax optimal rate in the L ∞ norm, which in turn ensures the minimax optimality of the corresponding Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the model is introduced and ap-proximate diagonalization of Toeplitz covariance matrices with the discrete cosine transform is discussed. Moreover, an alternative version of the Whittle's likelihood is proposed. In Section 3, new estimators for the Toeplitz covariance matrix and the precision matrix are derived, while in Section 4 their theoretical properties are presented. Section 5 contains simulation results, Section 6 presents a real data example, and Section 7 closes the paper with a discussion. The proofs are given in the appendix to the paper. Set up and diagonalization of Toeplitz matrices\n\nLet Y 1 , . . . , Y n i.i.d. ∼ N p (0 p , Σ), where Σ is a (p × p)-dimensional positive definite covariance matrix with a Toeplitz structure, that is, Σ = {σ |i−j| } p i,j=1 0.",
      "The sample size n may tend to infinity or to be a constant. The case n = 1 corresponds to a single observation of a stationary time series, and in this case the data are simply denoted by Y ∼N p (0 p , Σ). The dimension p is assumed to grow. The spectral density function f , corresponding to a Toeplitz covariance matrix Σ, is given by so that for f ∈ L 2 (−π, π) the inverse Fourier transform implies Hence, Σ is completely characterized by f , and the non-negativity of the spectral density function implies the positive definiteness of the covariance matrix. Moreover, the decay of the autocovariance σ k is directly connected to the smoothness of f . Finally, the convergence rate of a Toeplitz covariance estimator and that of the corresponding spectral density estimator are directly related via Σ ≤ f ∞ := sup x∈ |f (x)|, where • denotes the spectral norm (see . As in , we introduce a class of positive definite Toeplitz covariance matrices with Hölder continuous spectral densities. For β = γ + α > 0, where The optimal convergence rate for estimating Toeplitz covariance matrices over P β (M 0 , M 1 ) depends crucially on β. It is well known that the k-th Fourier coefficient of a function whose γ-th derivative is α-Hölder continuous decays at least with order O(k −β ) (see . Hence, β determines the decay rate of the autocovariances σ k , which are the Fourier coefficients of the spectral density f , as k → ∞. In particular, this implies that for β ∈ (0, 1], the class P β (M 0 , M 1 ) includes Toeplitz covariance matrices corresponding to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities, since the sequence of corresponding autocovariances is not summable. A connection between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities is further exploited in the following lemma. Lemma 1. Let Σ ∈ P β (M 0 , M 1 ) and let x j = (j − 1)/(p − 1), j = 1, ..., p, then where δ i,j is the Kroneker delta, O(•) terms are uniform over i, j = 1, . . . , p and divided by √ 2 when i, j ∈ {1, p} is the Discrete Cosine Transform I (DCT-I) matrix.",
      "However, it turns out that the right choice of the subseries length is crucial for this approach, but there is no data-based method available for this. In this work, an alternative way to estimate a Toeplitz covariance matrix and its inverse is chosen. Our approach exploits the one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz covariance matrices and their spectral densities. First, the given data are transformed into approximate Gaussian random variables whose mean equals to the logarithm of the spectral density. Then, the log-spectral density is estimated by a periodic smoothing spline with a data-driven smoothing parameter. Finally, the resulting spectral density estimator is transformed into an estimator for Σ or its inverse. It is shown that this procedure leads to an estimator that is fully data-driven, automatically positive definite and achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the spectral norm over a large class of Toeplitz covariance matrices. In particular, this class includes Toeplitz covariance matrices that correspond to long-memory processes with bounded spectral densities. Moreover, the computation is very efficient, does not require iterative or resampling schemes and allows to apply any inference and adaptive estimation procedures developed in the context of nonparametric Gaussian regression. Estimation of the spectral density from a stationary time series is a research topic with a long history. Earlier nonparametric methods are based on smoothing of the (log-)periodogram, which itself is not a consistent estimator . Another line of nonparametric methods for estimating the spectral density is based on the Whittle likelihood, which is an ap-proximation to the exact likelihood of the time series in the frequency domain. For example, estimated the spectral density from a penalized Whittle likelihood, while used polynomial splines to estimate the log-spectral density function maximizing the Whittle likelihood. Recently, Bayesian methods for spectral density estimation have been proposed (see , but these may become very computationally intensive in large samples due to posterior sampling.",

This estimator is based on a data transformation that translates the problem of Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation to the problem of mean estimation in an approximate Gaussian regression. The resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix estimator is positive definite by construction, fully data-driven and computationally very fast. Moreover, this estimator is shown to be minimax optimal under the spectral norm for a large class of Toeplitz matrices. These results are readily extended to estimation of inverses of Toeplitz covariance matrices.

      "The way the staff yo-yo'd Mark Spinney and others at Center the past two years hurt our consistency. And it impacts the QB position too. White's new to the role, so this could lead to more chaos. I hope not. We need him to be good from Day 1. He needs to set the tone for the OL and communicate with Rettig. Other players are important, but White -- or whoever starts at Center -- will be the keystone to the offense. Why I like his chances to shine: Like Cleary, I think White is one of those guys who would have thrived under old BC regimes. He's been smart and tough from the minute he was eligible to play. He might not be as powerful as needed, but now as a redshirt JR, he should be fully matured. Plus playing Center doesn't require as much power and is more reliant on smarts and quickness. I don't know if White will be our starting Center for Miami or even later into the season. Under Devine positions and the depth chart were constantly being tweaked. I pray things are different with Bollman. Let White learned to be a Center. He has a chance to be a great one. Labels: 2012 Preview, Ian White, Jim Bollman, Key Players, Preseason, Sean Devine\nHow I talk myself into thinking we are going to be good... You can see it on the BC message boards. You can see it on twitter and on the blogs. Optimism is rising. People are looking forward to the BC Football season. On Eagle Outsider they sarcastically call this \"10-2 season.\" It is that time of year when every aspect of the team and season still has hope and promise. Despite my best judgement and spending half of my posts speculating on Spaz's future, I am falling into this same trap. The closer we get to kickoff and the more I read, the more I think BC might surprise people this year. I am not ready to post my predictions for the season, but here are a few reasons why I do think this team should be bowl bound. It looks tougher on paper than it really is. Our toughest opponents come to us. We play three of our first four at home. Playing FSU and Georgia Tech on back-to-back weeks is a bit rough, but playing Georgia Tech any time forces a team to regroup.",
      "When he first arrived, Jags said that he could be the next Costanzo. Tall and lean (for a lineman) Cleary's been a consistent contributor like Costanzo (playing in 36 games and starting 26) yet he's never been the consistently great like Costanzo. How much of Cleary's occasional mistakes or setback are due to talent, coaching or the offense? I think it's been a bit of everything. What he needs to be: Good isn't good enough anymore. Cleary takes on the big responsibility of left tackle this year. Rettig has been running for his life the past three years. If the offense is ever going to take off, they need to improve pass protection. That will start with Cleary. And in the ACC, he'll be facing some of the top defensive linemen in the country on a weekly basis. Cleary's always been good with speed guys on the edge. He'll also need to improve on run blocking. If Martin uses more stretches and zones like Logan, that will leave Cleary often sealing off edges on run plays. Why I like his chances to shine: We've seen offensive lineman make huge leaps from season to season before. Part of it is maturing into their bodies and understanding the position. But a lot is coaching. I think Cleary has been underserved in that department. Even if Bollman is not some OL guru, I think Cleary playing in a more pass happy, up tempo offense will play to his strengths. I think his leadership position and the coaching staff's confidence in him will make him shine at LT. I think he will live up to his potential and have multiple games where he dominates and plays mistake free football. Plus he still has the NFL on his horizon. If he can perform at an elite level, he can jump up from a late round afterthought to a high-round pick. I think if Cleary stays healthy, he shoot up draft boards. If BC's offense breaks out of its doldrums he'll be named an all conference player. Labels: 2012 Preview, emmett cleary, Jim Bollman, Key Players\nBC using coordinators as face(s) of the program?

      "Appiah was new to the inside but he showed natural ability and moved very well considering he played nearly 30 pounds lighter in high school. What he needs to be: We need Appiah to be like B.J. Raji or Ron Brace. We don't have as many difference makers in other areas of the defense. If Appiah and Ramsey partner to become a dominant force -- like Brace and Raji -- it will create all sorts of opportunities for the rest of the defense. If the two of them can control the line of scrimmage we can become one of the elite DLines in the ACC. Why I like his chances to shine: It feels like I am head of the Appiah fan club. Spaz doesn't even have him at the top of the preseason depth chart. Of all the guys I have profiled, he would probably be viewed as the least likely to make an impact. He's still young. He's still learning the position and he's still getting used to moving with his added bulk. But I saw enough moments that I believe Appiah can be a great DT. He has the push, the leverage and surprising speed for big guy. Other teams had trouble handling him last year. If Appiah remains focused and works hard, he is going to dominate every interior lineman in the conference. And if Ramsey and Appiah both play well, BC will be a bowl team again.

That's not particularly surprising since the majority of the reporters are from Carolina and still view us as a secondary program. Although I teased him on twitter, even Meter avoided his usual \"BC: 1st\" vote. The recurring question for Spaz was regarding Kuechly. He handles it well and points to Ramsey as the type of player who can fill the void. Not too many asked Spaz about the \"Hot Seat.\" (I didn't embed that video due to the auto play issues.) It will be interesting to see if BC benefits from the looming exodus at Penn State. We are positioned well since we have scholarship space and recruited many of their kids.",
      "That he would some how save the Spaz era from its offensive funk and lead BC to unexpected glory. Instead, he's been mediocre. He completed just over half of his passes last year and never put together back-to-back great games nor enough sustained drives. Apologists for Rettig like me blame the system, the talent around him and of course the way his Spaz has screwed up the offense. But even the biggest Rettig cheerleaders have to admit he's yet to have a memorable BC moment or done anything to get on an NFL radar. What he needs to be: Someone who can put the team on his back. I know the offensive line has been terrible, leaving Chase running for his life. I know plenty of passes have been dropped and no one is making big plays. But a truly great QB would show more by now. He's started 21 games. He's finally is a simplified offense that will get the ball out of his hands. If Chase does have an accurate arm, if he is as cerebral as people say, if he can get off throws in a collapsing pocket, now is his chance to show it. Why I like his chances to shine: I don't know if Doug Martin is going to be a miracle worker, but QB's can make huge leaps with a new offense. Just look at Dominique Davis. He went to East Carolina and became one of the most accurate passers in the country. Last year I thought Rettig would be great. I thought his toughness and preparation would overcome the offensive limitations. Here I am a year late thinking the same thing. But the difference is Doug Martin. We finally have an experienced OC running a current, simple offense. Rettig will be asked to make quick decisions and get the ball out fast. I think he can do it. I also think that throwing 400+ passes will give him a rhythm and a confidence that he's never had at BC.

I love some of the young DBs (Keyes, Asprilla) and think with a healthy Noel and improved ALJ, we can be solid defensively. I still think Chase Rettig can be great. I have real hope for Doug Martin and think our WR and TE talent is good enough. The biggest question is the offensive line. But as someone who has preached for a OL coaching change, I keep telling myself that Bollman will make a difference.\nEmotion and Pride\nFootball is an emotional game and emotional sport. Point fingers at whomever you like, but BC had awful team and coaching chemistry last season. When I see Al Washington posting on Facebook about his excitement, when I hear about the 5th year Seniors wanting to end their careers on a high note, when I look at the new field, I think that positive energy and emotion will carry us to an extra win or two.

You know, I don't know of any incidences where I, first hand, have seen evidence of him committing human rights violations, and if he did, he has to be held accountable like everyone else. And I have said that publicly and I will say that privately. So my judgment is just based upon my experience with him, the fact that he is a knowledgeable person, he understands the need to interact and interface with the West. I think he could be a viable candidate. But ultimately, my opinion is hopefully going to be the opinion of the Libyan people. BLITZER: Because you probably have seen all of the articles, the reports over the past month, month and a half, of mass murder, of killings, not only by Saif Al-Islam, but some of his brothers that have gone on, the atrocities that have been so widely reported. I hear what you're saying about his role over the recent years when the Bush administration, and later the Obama administration, was trying to improve relations with Libya, but over the past several weeks, based on all of the international reporting we have seen, it's been a brutal record that he has accomplished. WELDON: Well, again, I don't have firsthand evidence of that. I just got here two days ago. And I fully support an international tribunal to look at human rights violations on everyone in this country. That's necessary. And if they find evidence that he has been involved in that, then he should suffer the consequences of his actions.

What I am hoping for is what the president wants, which is a free and fair election to take place, hopefully sooner rather than later. But having been involved with Libya for seven years, I was a witness to the work that Saif did in the Lockerbie case, the La Bella nightclub bombing. I personally witnessed through the Gadhafi Foundation the work that Saif did to free up the Bulgarian nurses who were sentenced to death twice, along with a Palestinian doctor. I have seen the work that Saif and Dr. Salani (ph) at the foundation have done in dealing with chemical weapons destruction and with the elimination of landmines and humanitarian efforts worldwide. I have been out to (INAUDIBLE), the chemical weapons plant, and I have actually seen visibly how they have removed the chemical weapons production materials. He was behind all of that. Believe me, Wolf, I'm not happy with some of the statements and the actions that he's made over the past month, and he knows I'm not happy. But I think in a fair election, up until now, he should be given the opportunity to seek office where he can run against other candidates, perhaps, for the presidency. And so I would at this time think that he should be allowed that opportunity. That's not to say I condone anything that he said or his actions. He will have to be accountable for those on his own.\nBLITZER: Because you make him sound like he's a decent guy when so many people think he is a killer, a murderer, especially given the statements that he recently made, that if he goes into Benghazi, if he finds these rebels, he will go and kill them all. You make it sound like he's a decent guy. WELDON: Well, I -- you know, I haven't been with him on a continual basis.

      "Topography images have been recorded in constant current mode with a grounded sample, using mechanically cut Pt/Ir tips. Differential conductance $dI/dV$ spectra, proportional in first approximation to the local density of states (LDOS)~\\cite{Tersoff85} have been recorded using a lock-in amplifier technique. The LDOS spatial evolution along a nanotube axis is obtained by $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps built by a series of equidistant $dI/dV$ spectra. Spatial extent mismatches between topography images and consecutive $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps have been systematically corrected~\\cite{Buchs_Ar}, and the metallic nature of the tip has been systematically checked on the gold substrate to prevent any tip artefacts before recording STM or/and STS data sets. \\\\\n\\indent Nanotube samples were made of extremely pure high-pressure CO conversion (HiPCo) SWNTs~\\cite{Smalley01} with a diameter distribution centered around 1 nm, FWHM $\\sim$ 0.3 nm~\\cite{Buchs_conf}.

      "\\\\\n\\indent Another technique for achieving confinement in SWNTs makes use of artificial defects such as covalently bound oxygen or aryl functionalization groups on the side walls of semiconducting SWNTs, inducing deep exciton trap states allowing for single-photon emission at room temperature~\\cite{Htoon_2015,tunable_QD_defects}. Also, carrier confinement between defect pairs acting as strong scattering centers has been reported for mechanically induced defects~\\cite{Postma_SET} as well as for ion-induced defects with reported level spacings up to 200 meV in metallic SWNTs~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. The latter technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and localization~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} offers a high potential for engineering a broad set of SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature. \\\\\n\\indent Here, we demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducting SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations. \\section{Experimental section}\n\nThe experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum.",
      "This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests that a better contrast of the experimental quantized states, especially in the valence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction through $e.g.$ the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl films~\\cite{Ruffieux_Nature_2016}. This would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well as in the associated scattering physics at the confining defects~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. \n\n\\section{Conclusions and outlook} In summary, using low-temperature STM/STS measurements supported by an analytical model and ab-initio simulations, we have demonstrated that intrananotube quantum dots with confined electron and hole states characterized by energy level spacings well above thermal broadening at room temperature can be generated in semiconducting SWNTs by structural defects such as vacancies and di-vacancies, as well as nitrogen ad-atoms. These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} as well as chirality control~\\cite{tunable_QD_defects}, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices. These include $e.g.$ electrically driven single-photon emitters operating at room temperature and telecom wavelength. In this context, the observation of quantum confinement effects in the emitted light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs~\\cite{Dai_2008} shall be seen as an additional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our \"QD with leads\" building-blocks. These would include $e.g.$ studying optical transitions selection rules for different types and configurations of defect pairs~\\cite{sel_rules_2006} associated with experimental studies such as photoluminescence~\\cite{Lefebvre06} combined to $g^{(2)}$ correlation measurements~\\cite{Hofmann_2013} in suspended SWNT devices as well as photocurrent imaging~\\cite{Buchs_Nat_comm} and spectroscopy~\\cite{Gabor_2009}.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThe authors thank Ethan Minot, Lee Aspitarte, Jhon Gonzalez, Andres Ayuela, Omjoti Dutta and Arkady Krasheninnikov for fruitful discussions.",
      "In particular Mn incorporation is highly inhomogeneous. For very low growth temperatures (below 120$^\\circ$C) the diffusion of Mn atoms leads to the formation of Mn rich, vertical nanocolumns. Their density mostly depends on Mn concentration and their mean diameter is about 2 nm. These results can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Fukushima \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Fuku06}: they proposed a model of spinodal decomposition in (Ga,Mn)N and (Zn,Cr)Te based on layer by layer growth conditions and a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms which leads to the formation of nanocolumns. This model may also properly describe the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns in our samples. Layer by layer growth conditions can be deduced from RHEED pattern evolution during growth. For all the samples grown at low temperature, RHEED observations clearly indicate two-dimensional growth. Moreover, Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructures have been grown and observed by TEM (see Fig. 5). Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge (as well as Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$) interfaces are very flat and sharp thus confirming a two-dimensional, layer by layer growth mode. Therefore we can assume that the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns is a consequence of 2D-spinodal decomposition. \\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\center\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig5.eps}\n    \\caption{Cross section high resolution micrograph of a Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructure.

      "Also, the simulated LDOS displays a pattern with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right, as observed experimentally, due to a left barrier with a larger scattering strength.

We find a good agreement with the experimental LDOS with the parameters: $V_{d3'}=V_{d4}\\simeq$ 0.47 eV, $a_\\mathrm{d6'}=1.5$ nm, $a_\\mathrm{d7}=2.6$ nm and $U_\\mathrm{C}=V_\\mathrm{L}-V_\\mathrm{R}\\simeq 47$ meV. Note that in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(b) the barrier and potential heights are multiplied by $\\alpha$ to allow a direct comparison with the experimental LDOS. The simulated LDOS shows a pattern with curved stripes oriented from bottom left to top right, as observed experimentally, due to a right barrier exhibiting a larger scattering strength. Also, the spatial profile of the obtained bound states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_N}(a) and (b)) reproduces the experimental features quite well. Note also that one can distinguish an isolated state in the experimental LDOS at an energy level between m1 and m2, about in the middle of the QD. This state that prevented an accurate fit of the state m2 in the right QD part is attributed to a spatial feature visible in the STM topography image in Fig.~\\ref{exp_data_Ar}(d) (see also supplementary information, Fig.S2(f)), probably a physisorbed impurity which does not affect the LDOS significantly. \\\\\n\\subsection{Ab-initio calculations}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figure_4.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{num_data} (a)-(c) LDOS ab-initio simulations of a semiconducting $(16,0)$ SWNT with combinations of vacancies defects separated by 11.1 nm."

      "Operator Phillips Petroleum Company moved its offices from the Dusavik base outside Stavanger to Tananger in Sola, and Shell could finally start refining Norwegian rather than imported crude.

Phillips and Shell became cornerstone companies. A large part of their workforce, particularly in Phillips, worked offshore. In addition came newly established oil supply firms. More jobs were also created in retail, public administration, education, health and social care, personal services and so forth. Although traditional agriculture remained important for the local authority, the number of farmers gradually declined as a result of mechanisation.[REMOVE]Fotnote: This article is based on the chapter “Elverket i Oljealderen” in I det regionale spenningsfelt.

Tax revenues rose even faster than population and jobs. To give an indication, the local authority’s overall income from wealth and income taxes rose from NOK 9.3 million in 1966 to NOK 198 million in 1990. The biggest growth came in 1978-82, when it averaged 39 per cent a year.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Sola local authority, plans. The secret behind this sharp increase was the tax paid by the oil companies – primarily Phillips – on agio, or the percentage fee charged when exchanging one currency for another. Under Norwegian law at the time, the companies paid tax on their interest income to the local authority where they had their head office. In making this rule, however, the government had failed to take account of the considerable sums involved.",

These deposits yielded substantial interest payments, and tax was payable on converting this income into Norwegian kroner.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Toralv Torstenbø, former chief executive officer in Sola local authority, interviewed by Kristin Øye Gjerde, 22 February 2001. Sola council is said to have almost gone into shock the first time Phillips paid this agio tax. It suddenly had more money than it could spend. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Sola’s municipal income always exceeded the budgeted amount. Large sums could be transferred every year to a capital fund. Since the local authority was in a growth phase, additional funding was needed for the big developments it faced. While the rest of Norway experienced a slump in the late 1970s, Sola continued in top gear without a sign of unemployment. Net income tax revenues came to NOK 55.5 million in 1978, while net spending was NOK 31.9 million. And these fantastic results went on improving. By 1982, wealth and income taxes yielded NOK 203.4 million – compared with a budget of NOK 146 million, which was upgraded to NOK 190 million during the year. According to Toralv Torstensbø, the financial controller, agio tax accounted for almost half this amount – in other words, as much as the tax paid by all other enterprises, private individuals and industry in Sola. Its chief executive officer became a little overweening. In his comments on the 1982 budget, he declared that it would be “natural for Sola local authority to feel a strong regional responsibility and not to be too strict about the traditional division of costs between state, county and local authority.” In line with this open-handed policy, Sola paid for both road projects and an upper secondary modern school which the county council was supposed to fund.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer’s budget proposal for Sola local authority covering 1974-85.",
      "Such equipment had been tried out on the seabed earlier, but on a limited scale and not in the deep and rough waters found on Ekofisk. This challenge was overcome by having the wellheads manufactured and then reinforced at the Phillips base in Dusavik outside Stavanger. Flowlines and control cables would also be laid from each well to Gulftide, with production comingled in a single riser to the topsides. Weather conditions also represented a major problem when designing the loading buoys. Phillips itself had experience with such facilities, but the concept had only been used before in harbour-like conditions and waters no deeper than 27 metres. They were now to stand in 70 metres in the middle of the North Sea. Gulftide was converted in the Åmøy Fjord outside Stavanger to cope with conditions on Ekofisk. The processing facilities were installed and reinforcements made to the derrick, helideck, hangar and leg structures.

Brown & Root won this contract, with the first oil pipelines on the Norwegian continental shelf laid by the Hugh W Gordon laybarge. The production principle on Gulftide was relatively simple. Output flowed from the subsea wellheads to the rig, where it passed through two separation levels to be split into oil and gas while the huge pressure was reduced. Gas was flared off and the oil was piped to one of the loading buoys where a shuttle tanker was moored. Production could only take place when a ship was present.

It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage.

      "(1) Physical modelling, (2) Algorithm design, (3) Numerical experiments and analysis of complex physical fields. The research of equation algorithm corresponds to the part (2) of the above three parts. The DBM aims at parts (1) and (3) of the three mentioned above. It belongs to a physical model construction method rather than a numerical solution for the equations. The tasks of DBM are to: (i) Ensure the rationality of the physical model (theoretical model) and balance the simplicity for the problem to be studied; (ii) Try to extract more valuable physical information from massive data and complex physical fields. Based on the coarse-grained modeling method of nonequilibrium statistical physics, the DBM aims to solve the following dilemma: (i) The traditional hydrodynamic modelings are based on the continuous hypothesis (or near-equilibrium hypothesis). They only concern the evolution of three conserved kinetic moments of the distribution function, i.e. the density, momentum and energy, so their physical functions are insufficient. (ii) The situation that the MD can be used is restricted to too small spatial-temporal scales. The physical requirement for the modeling is that except for the Hydrodynamic Non-Equilibriums (HNE), the most related TNE are also needed to be captured. Theoretically, the Boltzmann equation is suitable for all-regime flows, including the continuum regime, slip regime, transition regime, and free molecule flow regime. Based on the Chapman-Enskog (CE) multiscale analysis , through retaining various orders of Kn number (or considering different orders of TNE effects), the Boltzmann equation can be reduced to the various orders of hydrodynamic equations. They can be used to describe the hydrodynamic behaviors, i.e., the conservations of mass, momentum and energy , in corresponding flow regimes. Because what the traditional hydrodynamic equations describe are only the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. Consequently, it should be pointed out that, the information lost in the traditional hydrodynamic equations increases sharply with increasing the Kn number.",
      "Generally, there are three kinds of physical modeling methods (or models) for SBI numerical research, i.e., the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic modeling methods. Most of the existing numerical researches on SBI are related to the macroscopic modeling methods (such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes (NS) models) based on the continuous hypothesis (or equilibrium and nearequilibrium hypothesis) . For example, presented the computational results on the evolution of the shock-accelerated heavy bubbles through the multi-fluid Eulerian equation . There also exist a few SBI works based on the mesoscopic modeling method, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method . The microscopic modeling methods such as the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is capable of capturing much more flow behaviors but restricted to smaller spatiotemporal scales because of its huge computing costs. In the numerical research on SBI, three points need to be concerned. (i) Investigation of kinetic modeling that describes the non-continuity/non-equilibrium flows. Most of the current researches are based on macroscopic models. However, there exist abundant small structure (and fast-changing patterns) behaviors and effects such as the shock wave, boundary layer, material defects, etc. For cases with small structures, the mean free path of molecules cannot be ignored compared to the characteristic length, i.e., the non-continuity (discreteness) of the system is pronounced, which challenge the rationality and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the continuity hypothesis. For cases with fast-changing patterns, the system dose not have enough time to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium state, i.e., the system may significantly deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Therefore, the rational-ity and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium (or near thermodynamic equilibrium) will be challenged. (ii) Improvement of method that describes the evolution characteristics of bubbles and flows morphology.",
      "With increasing the Kn number, to ensure the describing capability not to decrease significantly, the more appropriate hydrodynamic equations should be the Extended Hydrodynamic Equations (EHEs) which include not only the evolution equations of conserved kinetic moments but also the most relevant nonconserved kinetic moments of distribution function. For convenience of description we refer the modeling method that derives EHEs from the fundamental kinetic equation to Kinetic Macroscopic Modeling (KMM) method. It is clear that, the complex process of CE expansion is necessary and the simulation is still based on the macroscopic equations in KMM. As a comparison, the DBM is a kind of Kinetic Direct Modeling (KDM) method. In DBM modeling, the CE analysis is only used to quickly determine which kinetic moments should keep values unchanged, the final EHEs are not needed, and the simulation is not based on the complicated EHEs. As the TNE degree of the flow to be described rises gradually, the complexity of the derivation process and difficulty of numerical simulation in the KMM method increase sharply. However, in the DBM method, to describe flows in a one-order more deeper depth of TNE, only two more related kinetic moments need to be added. Since without needing to derive and solve the EHEs, as the TNE degree deepens, the complexity of the DBM approach increases much slower than that of KMM method. The core step in DBM modeling is to provide a feasible scheme for detecting, describing, presenting, and analyzing TNE effects and behaviors beyond traditional macroscopic modeling. Based on the non-equilibrium statistical physics, we can use the non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) to describe how and how much the system deviates from the thermodynamic equilibrium state and to check corresponding effects due to deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The non-conservative moments of ( f − f eq ) open a phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive geometric correspondence for describing complex TNE system properties.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "(ii) Discretization of the particle velocity space under the condition that the reserved kinetic moments keep their values unchanged. (iii) Checking the TNE state and extracting TNE information. (iv) The selection/design of the boundary conditions. Simplification and modification of the Boltzmann equation\n\nAs we know, the collision term in the original Boltzmann contains high dimensional distribution functions. Therefore, the direct solution to it needs too much computing consumption. The most common method to simplify the collision operator is to introduce a local equilibrium distribution function ( f eq ) and write the complex collision operator in a linearized form, i.e., the original BGK collision operator − 1 τ ( f − f eq ), where τ is the relaxation time . The original BGK operator describes the situation where the system is always in the quasi-equilibrium state. Namely, it characterizes only the situation where the Kn number of the system is small enough and f ≈ f eq . The currently used BGK operator for non-equilibrium flows in the field is a modified version incorporating the meanfield theory description . Based on the above considerations, the simplified Boltzmann equation describing the SBI process is where the two-dimensional equilibrium distribution function is ) where ρ, T , v, u, I, R, and η are the mass density, temperature, particle velocity vector, flow velocity vector, the number of the extra degrees of freedom including molecular rotation and vibration inside the molecules, gas constant, and a free parameter that describes the energy of the extra degrees of freedom, respectively. The specific-heat ratio is flexible by adjusting parameter I, i.e., γ = (D + I + 2)/(D + I), where D = 2 represents the two-dimensional space. Discretization of the particle velocity space and determination of f σ ,eq i\n\nThe continuous Boltzmann equation should be discretized for simulating.

Such a departure is not entirely surprising.",
      "\\section*{Dynamical Behaviour of $O$ in Lattice Gases}\n\nThe dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order parameter  $m$ [see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-m} in the Letter] following a quench to the critical point is well described by\nthe Gaussian theory for all the three lattice gas models studied, $i.e.,$ driven lattice gas with either constant (IDLG) or random (RDLG) infinite drive and equilibrium lattice gas (LG). In other words, in the short-time regime, $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:mt}] and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode [defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:binder}] is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter $O,$ however, distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. In order to understand  this, we first write the phenomenological scaling form for $O$,  analogous to Eq. \\eqref{eq:scalingass} in  the Letter,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO (t, L_{\\parallel} ; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O (t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)} ; S_\\Delta).\\quad\n\\label{eq:Oscalingass}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe already remarked that, in the LG, this scaling form is not compatible with the prediction $O \\sim t^{1/8}  L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$ of the Gaussian theory. However, following Ref. \\cite{AS2002}, it can be argued that, at short times, the only dependence of $O$ on the system size $L_{\\parallel}$ is of the form $O \\sim L_\\parallel^{-1/2}$ which is very well confirmed by numerical simulations. Accordingly,  the generic behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_\\parallel^{-1/2}, \\label{eq:O}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined.

      "(\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases. The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}. With \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices. For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal. Otherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$.

      "In comparison, the outof-plane field is coupled to the interlayer dipole moment p in the form of −E ⊥ p, where p = ed 0 σz with σz as the Pauli matrix in the layer index subspace and d 0 the interlayer distance. When the system has a more than twofold rotational axis in the z direction, as in tBG and tTMDs, any in-plane current driven by the out-of-plane field alone is forbidden. It also prohibits the off-diagonal components of the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor σ ab = ∂j a /∂E ||,b with respect to the in-plane input and output. Since the antisymmetric part of σ ab is not allowed by the Onsager reciprocity in nonmagnetic systems, all the off-diagonal components of σ ab is forbidden, irrespective of the order of out-of-plane field. On the other hand, as we will show, an in-plane Hall conductivity σ xy = −σ yx can still be driven by the product of an in-plane field and the time variation rate of an outof-plane ac field, which is a characteristic effect of chiral bilayers. To account for the effect, we make use of the semiclassical theory . The velocity of an electron in a bilayer system is given by where k is the 2D crystal momentum. Here and hereafter we suppress the band index for simplicity, unless otherwise noted. The three contributions in this equation come from the band velocity, the anomalous velocities induced by the k -space Berry curvature Ω k and by the hybrid Berry curvature Ω kE ⊥ in the (k, E ⊥ ) space. For the velocity at the order of interest, the k-space Berry curvature is corrected to the first order of the variation rate of out-of-plane field Ė⊥ as Here A = u k |i∂ k |u k is the unperturbed k-space Berry connection, with |u k being the cell-periodic part of the Bloch wave, whereas is its gauge invariant correction , which can be identified physically as an in-plane positional shift of an electron induced by the time evolution of the out-of-plane field. For a band with index n, we have whose numerator involves the interband matrix elements of the interlayer dipole and velocity operators, and ε n is the unperturbed band energy.",
      "As such, χ int is allowed if and only if the system possesses a chiral crystal structure, which is the very case of twisted bilayers . Moreover, since twisted structures with opposite twist angles are mirror images of each other, whereas the mirror reflection flips the sign of χ int , the direction of Hall current can be reversed by reversing twist direction. Hall rectification and frequency doubling. This effect can be utilized for the rectification and frequency doubling of an in-plane ac input E = E 0 cos ωt, provided that the out-of-plane field has the same frequency, namely E ⊥ = E 0 ⊥ cos (ωt + ϕ). The phase difference ϕ between the two fields plays an important role in determining the Hall current, which takes the form of j = j 0 sin ϕ + j 2ω sin(2ωt + ϕ). ( Here ω is required to be below the threshold for direct interband transition in order to validate the semiclassical treatment, and σ H has the dimension of conductance and quantifies the Hall response with respect to the in-plane input. In experiment, the Hall output by the crossed nonlinear dynamic Hall effect can be distinguished readily from the conventional nonlinear Hall effect driven by in-plane field alone, as they are odd and even, respectively, in the inplane field. One notes that while the double-frequency component appears for any ϕ, the rectified output is allowed only if the two crossed driving fields are not in-phase or antiphase. Its on/off, chirality (right or left), and magnitude are all controlled by the phase difference of the two fields. Such a unique tunability provides not only a prominent experimental hallmark of this effect, but also a controllable route to Hall rectification. In addition, reversing the direction of the out-of-plane field switches that of the Hall current, which also serves as a control knob. Application to tTMDs. We now study the effect quantitatively in tTMDs, using tMoTe 2 as an example (see details of the continuum model in ). For illustrative purposes, we take ω/2π = 0.1 THz and E 0 ⊥ d 0 = 10 mV in what follows.",
      "Such layer pseudospin structures can underlie novel quantum geometric properties when coupled with out-ofplane field. Recent studies have found layer circular photogalvanic effect and layer-contrasted time-reversaleven Hall effect , arising from band geometric quantities. In this work we unveil a new type of nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal symmetric twisted bilayers, where an intrinsic Hall current emerges under the combined action of an in-plane electric field E and an out-of-plane ac field E ⊥ (t): j ∼ Ė⊥ × E [see Fig. ]. Having the two driving fields (inputs) and the current response (output) all orthogonal to each other, the effect is dubbed as the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect. This is also the first nonlinear Hall contribution of an intrinsic nature in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic field, determined solely by the band structures, not relying on extrinsic factors such as disorders and relaxation times. The effect arises from the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers, and has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Having two driving fields of the same frequency, a dc Hall current develops, whose on/off, direction and magnitude can all be controlled by the phase difference of the two fields, which does not affect the magnitude of the double-frequency component. Such a characteristic tunability renders this effect a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. As examples, we show sizable effects in small angle twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) and twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), as well as tBG of large angles where Umklapp interlayer tunneling dominates. Geometric origin of the effect. A bilayer system couples to in-plane and out-of-plane driving electric fields in completely different ways. The in-plane field couples to the 2D crystal momentum, leading to Berry-phase effects in the 2D momentum space .",
      "Such a small moiré scale implies that the exact crystalline symmetry, which depends sensitively on fine details of rotation center, has critical influence on lowenergy response properties. To capture the Umklapp tunneling, we employ the tight-binding model . Figures ) and (c) show two distinct commensurate structures of tBG at θ = 21.8 • belonging to chiral point groups D 3 and D 6 , respectively. The atomic configurations in Figs. ) are equivalent, which are constructed by twisting AA-stacked bilayer graphene around an overlapping atom site, and that in Fig. ) is obtained by rotating around a hexagonal center. Band structures of these two configurations are drastically different within a low-energy window of ∼ 10 meV around the κ point . Remarkably, despite large θ, we still get σ H ∼ O(0.001) e 2 /h (D 3 ) and ∼ O(0.1) e 2 /h (D 6 ), which are comparable to those at small angles (cf. Fig. in the Supplemental Material ). Such sizable responses can be attributed to the strong interlayer coupling enabled by Umklapp processes . Apart from different intensities, the Hall conductivities in the two stacking configurations have distinct energy dependence: In Fig. , σ H shows a single peak centered at zero energy; In Fig. (f), it exhibits two antisymmetric peaks around zero. The peaks are centered around band degeneracies, and their profiles can be understood from the distribution of [∂ k × G] z . Figure (d) illustrates the atomic structure of tBG with a twist angle slightly deviating from θ = 21.8 • , forming a supermoiré pattern. In short range, the local stacking geometries resemble the commensurate configurations at θ = 21.8 • , while the stacking registries at different locales differ by a translation. Similar to the moiré landscapes in the small-angle limit, there also exist high-symmetry locales: Regions A and B enclose the D 3 structure, and region C contains the D 6 configuration. Position-dependent Hall response is therefore expected in such a supermoiré. As the intrinsic Hall signal from the D 6 configuration dominates [see Figs.\n3(e) vs (f)], the net response mimics that in Fig. ."

      "The query generator 301 queries the data storage server 265 or memory 237 depending upon the embodiment. The following is an example query generated by the query generator 301: ((Category: Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)). The content stream generator 304 receives candidate content items that include the channel attributes. The content stream generator 304, for the above mentioned query, receives text based articles that include the channel category politics and have a global score greater than 80. Additionally, the text based articles are from the source NewsWebsite. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 generates the stream by ordering the content items in order of their scores. In another embodiment, the content stream generator 304 determines an interestingness of each candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 determines the interestingness by comparing the candidate content items with a model generated for the user by the model generation engine 207 and scoring them.\nwhere p is a property, that is, a setting A=a of the attributes. The latter quantity, Pr(p|user) is approximated from the user's history of interactions with content items as well as the user's search history and other opt-in data. Similarly, the former quantity, Pr(item|p) is approximated by the (suitably weighted) reciprocal of the number of items with property p (e.g., if it is expected that p=((Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)) to generate 300 items, take Pr(item|p) to be 1/300).\nwhere the properties p are summed over single-attribute properties (as opposed to all possible settings of an entire collection of attributes), and G is an exponential function of the form G(x)=2(100 x), so that when applied in this form, if there are several values of p for which Pr(item|p) Pr(p|user) is large, the sum of their G-values slowly increases. Once the scores are calculated, the content stream generator 304 generates a stream of content for the channel that is ordered according to the candidate content item scores.",
      "In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 also uses contextual information of the user to identify the channel category. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel category and the channel attributes and queries 710 the new content items stored on the data storage server 265. The content stream generator 304 receives 712 candidate content items that include the channel category and channel attributes. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 receives additional candidate content items from the collaborative filtering engine 217. The content stream generator 304 scores 714 each candidate content item by comparing it to a model generated by the model generation engine 207. The score is calculated by determining an interestingness of the candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 then generates 716 the stream of content based on the scores for each candidate content item. The channel engine 240 then generates 718 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user.

      "The channel generator 378 then resubmits the request based on the changes made by the user. In response to the request, the channel generator 378 receives a stream of content from the scoring engine 211 and generates the channel for the user. The generated channel is either public or private depending upon the user's preferences. In one embodiment, the user shares the channel to a community, a group of people or any internet user. The channel is then displayed to the user with an interface generated by the user interface engine 260. Referring now to FIG. 3B, one embodiment of a scoring engine 211 is shown in more detail. The scoring engine 211 includes a query generator 301, a global scorer 302 and a content stream generator 304 that are each coupled to signal line 228. The global scorer 302 is used to rank new content items that are stored in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 (depending upon the embodiment). The global scorer 302 uses signals from the different verticals to compute a global user-independent score for each item to approximate its popularity or importance within the stream that produced it. The global scorer 302 normalizes the score across streams so that items from various streams are comparable to aid in generating a quick yet reasonable ranking of items. The global score is a combination of its quality specific to the source stream (depending on the rank of the source, number of known followers of a source, etc.) and its global popularity (trigger rate on universal search, relevance to trending queries, number of clicks, long clicks received, etc.). The global scorer 302 transmits the global score to storage where it is associated with the item. The global score helps rank the items for faster retrieval. For example, if the query generated by the query generator 301 includes a request for the top ten items about skiing, those items are already organized in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 according to the global score. The query generator 301 receives a request for a stream of content for a channel from the channel engine 240. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel attributes that are included in the request."

    "question": "Given the KR-2S's tendency to develop a \"banana\" shape in the top longeron, how does the specific design choice of \"tumbling home\" the side panels contribute to this curvature, and how does this relate to the challenges of achieving a straight and true fuselage?",

      "D) The application of side and bottom panels after forming the fuselage box section prevents the longerons from maintaining a straight alignment."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later. Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately. Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline. Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans. Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end. Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.",
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time.",
      "Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference. Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully. At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line. At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line. Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction. After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side. Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape. Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs."

      "All of a sudden that Mujahhid of Islam rose with the torch of knowledge and light against the winds of enmity and destruction - Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He immediately issued the true Fatawa on vasectomy and said, \"Vasectomy is Haraam, Haraam, Haraam.\" This news spread throughout India. Through the Dua and firmness of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) on this issue, the Government that wished to pass this law had lost power, and a new government came into power. The law on Vasectomy was abolished! Once, Maulana Abdul Hadi Al Qaderi and Soofi Iqbal Sahib asked Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) the following question: \"Huzoor! Can one remember his Sheikh in Namaaz?\" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) answered by saying, \"If you need to remember anyone in Namaaz then you should remember Tajedare Do Aalam, Habbibe Khuda (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Yes, just as people tend to gaze here and there in Namaaz - if, in this way, the thought of one's Peer comes into the mind, then there is no hindrance\". Subhan-Allah! Such caution is in this answer! This answer has also contradicted the Deobandi belief. By looking at the life of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and reading his Fatawas, one would see his status and excellence in the spiritual domain. His spiritual life was according to that of his renowned and distinguished father, Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). When the Americans were announcing there journey to the moon, a few Ulema were present with Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). Amongst these Ulema were Shamsul Ulema Hazrat Maulana Shamsud'deen and Allamah Ghulam Jilani Mirati (radi Allahu anhum). They were discussing the concepts concerning the sun and the moon. Mufti-e-Azam-e- Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said that the sky and the earth are both stationary and that the moon and the sun are in motion. On hearing this Allama Ghulam Jilani Mirati (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"In the Holy Quran it is said, 'Wash Shamsu Tajri Li Mustaqaril'laha'.",
      "Those present thought that the Chaadar had just got caught between Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers. They tried to remove the Chaadar from between his fingers but it would not move. The first person to notice this Karaamat was Hazrat Allamah Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari. He showed this to everyone. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers did not move until the area was properly covered. \"Zinda hojate he jo marte he haq ke Naam par, Allah, Allah Maut ko kis ne Masiha Kardiya\"\n\"Janaaze se utha kar haath Pakri Chaadare Aqdas, He too Zinda He ye Zinda Karaamat Mufti e Azam\"\nAs he had wished, the Janaza Salaah of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was performed by Maulana Sayed Mukhtar Ashraf Jilani at the Islamia Inter College grounds in Bareilly Shareef. Two and a half million (2 500 000) Muslims attended his Janazah Salaah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) is buried on the left-hand-side of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). Those who lowered Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) in his Qabr Shareef have stated that they were continously wiping out perspiration from the forehead of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) right up to the last minute. \"Maangne Waala sub kuch paaye rota aaye hasta Jaaye\", \"Ye He Unki Adna Karamat Mufti Azam Zinda Baad\"\nWealth, presidency, minister ship, worldly satisfaction and happiness can be given to a person by anyone, but such people do not have the spiritual insight to give tranquility to a disturbed heart and they cannot put a smile onto the face of a depressed person. But Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave both the treasures of the physical world and the spiritual worlds to those in need. To be his servant was not less than kingship. Every day hundreds and thousands of people in need of spiritual, physical and academic needs would come to him and each one of them returned with complete satisfaction. \"Jhuki Hai Gardane Dar Par Tumhare, Taaj Waalo Ki, Mere Aqa Mere Maula Wo Taajul Auliyah Tum Ho\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) is that light of such an illustrious family whose radiance reflected itself in his character and manners that he displayed - such qualities that very few would be able to reach perfection.",
      "When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior. \"Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at \"Darul Uloom Manzare Islam\", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him \"Mufti-e-Azam\" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name \"Mufti Azam Hind\" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality. Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind\" but he was also known as \"Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam\" or The Grand Mufti of the World."

      "Senate Floor Amendments of 8/20/10 revise the statute of\nlimitations and remedies for specified housing-related\nANALYSIS : The Planning and Zoning Law requires cities\nand counties to prepare and adopt a general plan, including\na housing element, to guide the future growth of a\ncommunity. Following a staggered statutory schedule,\ncities and counties located within the territory of a\nmetropolitan planning organization (MPO) must revise their\nhousing elements every eight years, and cities and counties\nin rural non-MPO regions must revise their housing elements\nevery five years. These five- and eight-year periods are\nknown as the housing element planning period. Before each revision, each community is assigned its fair\nshare of housing for each income category through the\nregional housing needs assessment (RHNA) process. A\nhousing element must identify and analyze existing and\nprojected housing needs, identify adequate sites with\nappropriate zoning to meet its share of the RHNA, and\nensure that regulatory systems provide opportunities for,\nand do not unduly constrain, housing development. The\nreviews both draft and adopted housing elements to\ndetermine whether or not they are in substantial compliance\nwith the law. The Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision Map Act\nalso includes a number of sections governing zoning and\nentitlements specifically related to housing, including:\n? The Housing Accountability Act, which requires a city or\ncounty to make one or more specified findings in order to\ndisapprove a particular housing development.\n? A provision requiring cities and counties, when adopting\nan ordinance which limits the number of housing units\nwhich may be constructed on an annual basis, to make\nfindings as to the public health, safety, and welfare\nbenefits that justify reducing the housing opportunities\nof the region. ? Density bonus law, which requires cities and counties to\ngrant a developer a density bonus, incentives, and\nconcessions when the developer proposes to include\nspecified percentages of affordable housing within a\ndevelopment. ?",

The Committee on Chemists with Disabilities (CWD) met at the 233rd ACS national meeting, Chicago, on Monday, March 26. Judy Summers-Gates reported on the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity meeting. This subcommittee is made up of representatives of the five committees that support people in chemistry (as opposed to a category of the profession): CWD, Committee on Minority Affairs, Committee on Technician Affairs, Women Chemists Committee, and Younger Chemists Committee, and its goal is to develop ways to coordinate the efforts of the five groups. The CWD Ambassador Program that was announced at CWD's 25th anniversary celebration at the Washington, D.C., meeting was discussed. Zelda Wasserman reported on the status of the letter from CWD to the ACS Board regarding captioning of ACS video materials. Janelle Kasper-Wolf, of ACS staff, discussed adding new questions to the ACS annual employment salary survey to obtain information for the committee. At the Chicago national meeting, the Committee on Community Activities (CCA) partnered with the ACS Education Division and the Office of the President to host \"Chemistry In Action—It's Easy Being Green\" at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum on Saturday, March 24.

The Committee on Minority Affairs (CMA) approved new vision, mission, and values statements at the Chicago national meeting. The mission of CMA is to increase the participation of minority chemical scientists and influence policy on behalf of minorities in ACS and the chemical enterprise. An aggressive new strategic plan was approved by CMA to guide its activities over the next three years. By the end of 2009, CMA will increase the number of ACS Scholars that graduate to 100 per year, add 100 new minorities to leadership positions in ACS, engage in several collaborations, and increase the number of minority members of ACS by 5,000. CMA will focus initially on increasing minorities in ACS leadership. In working toward this goal, CMA began work on two new leadership-development programs for minority chemists. CMA continues to support the work of the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity (JSD) in developing programs, products, and services to ensure full participation of all members in ACS. In Chicago, JSD premiered a diversity booth at the meeting exposition hall and cosponsored symposia. The Committee on Patents & Related Matters (CPRM) discussed proposed legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. patent system as well as open-access legislation and the potential effects such matters might have on industry and academia as well as on ACS. CPRM also continued its work on several new educational tools to assist and inform members on patent issues and other intellectual property matters important to a successful career in the chemical enterprise. Many of these tools are now available on the committee's expanded website, membership.acs.org/C/CPRM/.\nAt the March 2007 meeting, the Committee on Professional Training (CPT) reviewed 42 new and additional information reports from ACS-approved chemistry programs.",

Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice.",
      "Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them. Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\" Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress. Born resigned on June 1, 1999. The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets. As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.

Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms. An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.",
      "\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis. According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\" One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings. In 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk. Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter). She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren.

      "Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father. Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school. For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population. Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods. One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition. Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau.",
      "Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God. Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice. Characters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible. Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression. Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi. Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II). Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting).",
      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man.

      "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement. Plot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty. One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed."

      "Because the space of opportunity for people to engage in transactions with each other has been so enormously enlarged during the past decade, faith in marketplace democracies is on the rise worldwide; correspondingly faith in central management mechanisms is on the decline. This shift has brought with it a shift of the power of institutions. Government institutions tend to try to hold onto their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways. This can produce big tensions and even promote breakage. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the cryptographic area which we have just been talking about in the previous hour. This technology, cryptography, produces mechanisms for digital signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and private communication -- all offering a way for standard business practices now based on paper to be shifted into the electronic media. The success of worldwide enterprises depends on this shift being completed rapidly and effectively. As more people realize this, the momentum for incorporating cryptographic technology into the information infrastructure is accelerating. In this country, the National Security Agency has long been given the authority to regulate cryptography. This authority was granted in another time when the success of the country depended upon the ability of its government to gather intelligence and communicate in secret. These premises made sense in a world where most of the power resided in governments, but the world is changing. Much economic power is now accumulating in large apolitical transnational corporations. These corporations place their own concerns and strategies ahead of those of governments of the countries in which they do business. Like governments, they are interested in gathering intelligence about competitors and in conducting business in private. Unlike governments, they want open access to the technologies of authentication, electronic money, digital signatures, and certificates that will allow them to conduct business transactions across the network.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "Lastly, we find that the trends in power-law exponents usually point to mixed directions, and that large price variations are likely to become less frequent only in about 28% of the cryptocurrencies as they age and grow in market capitalization. Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008 , various different cryptoassets have been developed and are now considered to be at the cutting edge of innovation in finance . These digital financial assets are vastly diverse in design characteristics and intended purposes, ranging from peer-to-peer networks with underlying cash-like digital currencies (e.g.\nBitcoin) to general-purpose blockchains transacting in commodity-like digital assets (e.g. Ethereum), and even to cryptoassets that intend to replicate the price of conventional assets such as the US dollar or gold (e.g. Tether and Tether Gold) . With more than nine thousand cryptoassets as of 2022 , the total market value of cryptocurrencies has grown massively to a staggering $2 trillion peak in 2021 . Despite long-standing debates over the intrinsic value and legality of cryptoassets , or perhaps even precisely due to such controversies, it is undeniable that cryptocurrencies are increasingly attracting the attention of academics, investors, and central banks, around the world .

Esther Dyson, at the end of the panel, is among the most respected commentators on developing technology trends in the personal computer business.

Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their governments to regulate commerce, erase inequities, and build societies of better human beings. For over a hundred years, many people, from peasants to intellectuals, had faith that strong governments would bring them a better life. This faith was part of the clearing in which Communist governments flourished; although the United States took an anti-Communist stand, the same faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by great national programs including Social Security, welfare, food stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society. This faith is now shattered. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life. The dramatic collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people for federal, state, and local governments. The poor track record of government is not the only reason for the shift. Information technology has accelerated the process. Communications that took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions. Radio, TV, fax, and now E-mail are common worldwide, so much so that not even a powerful government can control what information its citizens have.",
      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society."

      "Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square. A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times. Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.",
      "The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system. Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering. Thus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances. Early 20th-century alternator made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of a hydroelectric station (photograph by Prokudin-Gorsky, 1905–1915). In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged.",
      "Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh. A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals. The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points."

These great Ulema were from amongst the students of Sayed Yahya Almaan (radi Allahu anhu). A few of the Ulema that he met were Allamah Sayed Ameen Qutbi; Allamah Sayed Abbas Alawi and Allamah Sayed Noor Muhammad (radi Allahu anhum) - to mention just a few. They narrated many incidents which had taken place during Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu's) visit to Haramain Sharifain. They then requested Khilafat from Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, (radi Allahu anhu) which he bestowed upon them. Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was aware of the actual time of his Wisaal. On the 6th of Muharram (1981) he said, \"All those who intended to become my Mureed but for some reason or the other could not come to me, I have made all of them Mureed and I have given their hands into the hand of Sayidduna Ghousul Azam (radi Allahu anhu). \"\nOn the 12th of Muharram (1981) Hazrat said, \"All those who asked me to make Dua for them, I have made Dua for their Jaiz (permissible) intentions to be fulfilled. May Allah accept this Dua.\" On this day he asked those that were present concerning date. They told him that it was the 12th of Muharram. On hearing this he became silent. On the 13th of Muharram, he again asked concerning the date and the Mureedeen present said that it was Wednesday, the 13th of Muharram. On hearing this Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"Namaaz will be held at Nau Mahla Musjid\". Those present did not understand what he meant, but remained silent out of respect. After some time again Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, \"Did anybody tell you about the Namaaz. I will read Jumma Namaaz in Nau Mahla Masjid.\" After some time Hazrat said, \"Did anybody say anything about the Fatiha.\"",
      "Those present thought that the Chaadar had just got caught between Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers. They tried to remove the Chaadar from between his fingers but it would not move. The first person to notice this Karaamat was Hazrat Allamah Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari. He showed this to everyone. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers did not move until the area was properly covered. \"Zinda hojate he jo marte he haq ke Naam par, Allah, Allah Maut ko kis ne Masiha Kardiya\"\n\"Janaaze se utha kar haath Pakri Chaadare Aqdas, He too Zinda He ye Zinda Karaamat Mufti e Azam\"\nAs he had wished, the Janaza Salaah of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was performed by Maulana Sayed Mukhtar Ashraf Jilani at the Islamia Inter College grounds in Bareilly Shareef. Two and a half million (2 500 000) Muslims attended his Janazah Salaah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) is buried on the left-hand-side of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). Those who lowered Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) in his Qabr Shareef have stated that they were continously wiping out perspiration from the forehead of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) right up to the last minute. \"Maangne Waala sub kuch paaye rota aaye hasta Jaaye\", \"Ye He Unki Adna Karamat Mufti Azam Zinda Baad\"\nWealth, presidency, minister ship, worldly satisfaction and happiness can be given to a person by anyone, but such people do not have the spiritual insight to give tranquility to a disturbed heart and they cannot put a smile onto the face of a depressed person. But Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave both the treasures of the physical world and the spiritual worlds to those in need. To be his servant was not less than kingship. Every day hundreds and thousands of people in need of spiritual, physical and academic needs would come to him and each one of them returned with complete satisfaction. \"Jhuki Hai Gardane Dar Par Tumhare, Taaj Waalo Ki, Mere Aqa Mere Maula Wo Taajul Auliyah Tum Ho\"\nMufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) is that light of such an illustrious family whose radiance reflected itself in his character and manners that he displayed - such qualities that very few would be able to reach perfection.",
      "The respect and honour that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) showed towards him was out of this world. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to walk bare feet behind him with great respect. \"\nThe great Ulema of the time have stated that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was lost to such an extent in the love for Sayyiduna Ghousul Azam, Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu) that even physically he began to resemble Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu). \"Dekh Kar Shakle Mufti Azam, Ghause Azam ki Yaad Aayi he\"\nGhousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had great respect and love for the Ulema and for Sayeds (Descendants of Sayyiduna Rasulullah sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). The respect which he showed towards them is beyond explanation. One day, in 1979, a lady came with her little child to ask for Ta'weez. It was a very hot day and she was informed that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was resting. The lady, however, was in great need for the particular Ta'weez. She asked someone to see if Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was awake but nobody had the nerve of going near him while he was resting as they considered this to be disrespectful. Taking her child she commented, \"What did we know that the words of Sayeds will not be heard in this place\". It is not known how Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) heard this, but he immediately summoned one of the Mureeds. He instructed him to call the lady and not give her grief. The woman then sent her child to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He asked the child's name and showed great love and respect towards this young child. With great affection, he placed his hand on the child's head. He even asked someone to bring an apple for the child. From behind the curtain, he spoke to the lady concerning her problem and immediately wrote a Ta'weez for her. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then sent a message to his family requesting that the mother and child should only be allowed to leave after the heat became less intense; that they should be well entertained and that no shortage should be spared in entertaining these Sayeds.",
      "When Allamah Sadru Shariah Maulana Amjad Ali Al Qadri (radi Allahu anhu), the author of the famous \"Bahare Shariah,\" used to come to Bareilly Shareef for the Urs Shareef of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to go to the railway station to welcome him and showed great respect towards this Scholar of Islam. He also showed great respect towards Sayyidi Hafiz-e-Millat and Hazrat Maulana Hasmat Ali Khan Sahib (radi Allahu anhum). He also showed respect towards his own Mureeds and Khalifas who were Alims. \"Hawa he Gotand wa Tez lekin Chiraagh Apna Jala Raha he, Wo Marde Durwesh jis ko Haq ne diye the Andaze Khusrawana\"\nThe sign of a true Mo'min is that he never submits himself before an enemy. In the worst of circumstances a Mo'min announces that which is the truth. Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said, \"To speak the truth before a tyrant King is a great Jihad.\" So imagine the excellence of a person who always spoke the truth at all times, a person who always raised the flag of truth and honesty, and a person who never left the path of truth in his entire life! Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was one such person. He is one of the greatest leaders of the Sunnis. His boldness and fearlessness is difficult to explain. His entire life was spent speaking against Deobandis, Wahabis and all the other misleading sects, whether is was against the West, Qadianism, or Najdism he always challenged them right till the very end. He always propagated the true Deen and the Path of the Ahle Sunnah Wa Jamaah. With his Fatawas, he helped protect the Imaan of not only the Muslims in India and Pakistan, but of Muslims throughout the world. He attacked the enemies of Islam through his writings, sayings, actions, etc. He did everything in his capacity to challenge the enemies of Islam. No person in his presence could say or do anything against Shariah. No person could speak against that which was the truth. It is stated by one of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Khaadim's, who accompanied him on a journey by train, that there were some people in the train who were consuming alcohol."

Over the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage. Please Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future. Thank you for listening and your site. I have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate. I did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she’s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn’t want to come home (the next day after school). By this stage, I also had enough and didn’t go get her. I thought I am not begging. You will run out of money soon. It was quite a relief to have some peace. Daughter’s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it). I didn’t really want this but made a compromise that daughter would go there Tues morning – Friday afternoon as the friend is an A student whereas my daughter is failing. They do the same subjects. I made the decision at the end of the day based on what is good for me – some time away from the daughter.",
      "We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying). It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior. I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too. She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your \"Launching Adult Children With Aspergers\" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations.",
      "He’s highly intelligent and successful, a pattern seeker, has a tendency to focus on the project to hand to the total exclusion of all else for as long sit takes (work or home) socially awkward (has learned coping strategies), sensitive to loud noise, high anxiety with control strategies, black and white thinking etc. He’s currently not working and I’ve seen a slow withdrawal over the last 6 weeks, including the need to ‘escape’ and leave a situation at least once. He also has a bipolar ex overseas who has primary custody one daughter where there has been ongoing patterns of drama which has recently increased. Over the past couple of months (since stopping work and drama increase) I’ve gone from being ‘wonderful’ in his eyes to him now being sorry and not having the ‘urge’ to spend close/intimate time with me and offering friendship. Since he shared that with me in a message he’s stonewalled and has retreated to the safety of minimal messages and talks about not knowing what best to say and not being able to find the right words somehow. He’s a good kind man who I feel is struggling. I’m concerned about his anxiety and possibly the risk of depression. I’m fairly resilient and whilst i’m disappointed he doesn’t want to pursue a relationship with me, i’m concerned for him and his well being. One of his very few close friends is also just leaving the country to live overseas. The strategy I’ve used so far is simply to back off and give him space. I’ve asked to take him up on an original offer he made to talk but haven’t pushed it. I also haven’t been aggressive or accusatory in the few messages i’ve sent. Any advise you could give would be greatly appreciated,\nCarli who is 10 years old and has had behavioral issues her whole life. The other night she came home very upset after having a conflict with a friend. She was at her friend's house and her and her friend wanted to get on the computer and the older sister was using it. Carli made up a story that someone was at the door to get the older sister off the computer. Her friend didn't understand that she was making up a story to get the sister off the computer.",
      "It has really helped me understand the last 32 years of our marriage and get a grasp on how to move forward. One area that is of primary concern to me, that I did not see addressed, is stimming. I believe that is the behavior my husband is showing through constant vocal singing, repetition of words, shouting out, as well as slapping himself in the chest and general nervous activity. It is very loud and disruptive to our household and it is often a relief when he is not at home. I think there may be a level of Tourette's syndrome as well. I did some searches on the Internet and could not find anything that really describes his behavior. Most of what I found was flapping or children's behavior. I understand that it is a release of nervous tension but I am really trying to find some strategies to help him stop this behavior as it is extremely frustrating and builds my resentment in dealing with it daily. A lot of it is embarrassing as well and sounds childish to me. He usually does this when close family members are around and will reign himself in if he is around other people besides us. When we are home it is constant. He also has a lot of anger, mostly at himself, and blows up at unimportant things, it is as if he has a ton of negative energy inside him that need to get out and stimming is one outlet. I will try to build my acceptance of it, but I also would just like him to stop especially the loudest and most annoying portions. Would you have any resources you could point me to?"

      "An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.:494–98 The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage. For practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable. Electric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface. Ørsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.",
      "Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh. A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals. The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points.",
      "For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines. Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed. Since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories.",
      "For other uses, see Electricity (disambiguation). \"Electric\" redirects here. For other uses, see Electric (disambiguation). Lightning is one of the most dramatic effects of electricity. Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts. electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution."

It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement. Plot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty. One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed.",
      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.",
      "Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God. Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice. Characters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible. Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression. Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi. Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II). Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting).",
      "Early life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden. English attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented. English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively. Fourth National Government (1990–1999) At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.",
      "Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father. Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school. For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population. Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods. One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition. Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau."

      "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University. The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.

Haas, Hendrik Wildner, Roberta Azzarelli, Donald M. Bell, Djoher Nora Abrous, François Guillemot. Institutions: MRC National Institute for Medical Research, National Institute for Medical Research, Université de Bordeaux. In utero electroporation (IUE) has become a powerful technique to study the development of different regions of the embryonic nervous system 1-5. To date this tool has been widely used to study the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and neuronal migration especially in the developing cerebral cortex 6-8. Here we detail our protocol to electroporate in utero the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus and provide evidence that this approach can be used to study dendrites and spines in these two cerebral regions. Finally, IUE provides a useful tool to identify functional interactions between genes involved in dendrite, spine and/or synapse development. Indeed, in contrast to other gene transfer methods such as virus, it is straightforward to combine multiple RNAi or transgenes in the same population of cells. In summary, IUE is a powerful method that has already contributed to the characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying brain function and disease and it should also be useful in the study of dendrites and spines.

      "Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping provided specific hardware and methodological criteria are followed. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices and stable micromanipulation allowing independent attainment of pre- and postsynaptic whole cell recordings. While CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell pairs are most widely used in the organotypic slice hippocampal preparation, this technique has also been successful in CA3-CA1 pairs and can be adapted to any neurons that are synaptically connected in the same slice preparation. In this manuscript we provide the detailed methodology and requirements for establishing this technique in any laboratory equipped for electrophysiology.

Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles. Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia.",
      "Aging and amyloid pathology may also exacerbate hippocampal damage sustained during the dissection procedure, again complicating any inferences drawn from physiologic assessment. Here, we discuss the steps taken during the dissection procedure to minimize these problems. Examples of synaptic responses acquired in \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" slices from rats and mice are provided, as well as representative synaptic plasticity experiments. The possible impact of other methodological factors on synaptic function in these animal models (e.g. recording solution components, stimulation parameters) are also discussed. While the focus of this article is on the use of aged rats and transgenic mice, novices to slice physiology should find enough detail here to get started on their own studies, using a variety of rodent models.

Bridges, Cicely L. Williams, Mildred A. Pointer, Emmanuel M. Awumey. Institutions: North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina Central University, Durham, Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Proximal resistance vessels, such as the mesenteric arteries, contribute substantially to the peripheral resistance. These small vessels of between 100-400 μm in diameter function primarily in directing blood flow to various organs according to the overall requirements of the body. The rat mesenteric artery has a diameter greater than 100 μm. The myography technique, first described by Mulvay and Halpern1, was based on the method proposed by Bevan and Osher2. The technique provides information about small vessels under isometric conditions, where substantial shortening of the muscle preparation is prevented. Since force production and sensitivity of vessels to different agonists is dependent on the extent of stretch, according to active tension-length relation, it is essential to conduct contraction studies under isometric conditions to prevent compliance of the mounting wires."

      "It is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. Even then I'm sure plenty fitting that description have faced the terror and torment enshrined into an institution that transforms the pride and enthusiasm of youth into a narrow zeal for dominating power relations. And we'll close with this from Francis A. Boyle's \"2011: Prospects for Humanity?\" (Global Research):Historically, this latest eruption of American militarism at the start of the 21st Century is akin to that of America opening the 20th Century by means of the U.S.-instigated Spanish-American War in 1898. Then the Republican administration of President William McKinley stole their colonial empire from Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; inflicted a near genocidal war against the Filipino people; while at the same time illegally annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii and subjecting the Native Hawaiian people (who call themselves the Kanaka Maoli) to near genocidal conditions. Additionally, McKinley's military and colonial expansion into the Pacific was also designed to secure America's economic exploitation of China pursuant to the euphemistic rubric of the \"open door\" policy. But over the next four decades America's aggressive presence, policies, and practices in the \"Pacific\" would ineluctably pave the way for Japan's attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 194l, and thus America's precipitation into the ongoing Second World War. Today a century later the serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III. By shamelessly exploiting the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001, the Bush Jr. administration set forth to steal a hydrocarbon empire from the Muslim states and peoples living in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf under the bogus pretexts of (1) fighting a war against international terrorism; and/or (2) eliminating weapons of mass destruction; and/or (3) the promotion of democracy; and/or (4) self-styled \"humanitarian intervention.\"",
      "Only this time the geopolitical stakes are infinitely greater than they were a century ago: control and domination of two-thirds of the world's hydrocarbon resources and thus the very fundament and energizer of the global economic system – oil and gas. The Bush Jr./ Obama administrations have already targeted the remaining hydrocarbon reserves of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia for further conquest or domination, together with the strategic choke-points at sea and on land required for their transportation. In this regard, the Bush Jr. administration announced the establishment of the U.S. Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM) in order to better control, dominate, and exploit both the natural resources and the variegated peoples of the continent of Africa, the very cradle of our human species. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated \"unlimited imperialism\" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all have in common an urge toward expansion which knows no rational limits, feeds on its own successes and, if not stopped by a superior force, will go on to the confines of the political world. This urge will not be satisfied so long as there remains anywhere a possible object of domination--a politically organized group of men which by its very independence challenges the conqueror's lust for power. It is, as we shall see, exactly the lack of moderation, the aspiration to conquer all that lends itself to conquest, characteristic of unlimited imperialism, which in the past has been the undoing of the imperialistic policies of this kind…. On 10 November 1979 I visited with Hans Morgenthau at his home in Manhattan. It proved to be our last conversation before he died on 19 July 1980. Given his weakened physical but not mental condition and his serious heart problem, at the end of our necessarily abbreviated one-hour meeting I purposefully asked him what he thought about the future of international relations.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",
      "It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so. Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians. \"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day. And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen. What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again. \"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children? Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur? And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive."

      "This fundamental debate reveals what is a stake in the basic architecture of the American regime. The second part of the course is a close study of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Regarded by many as the best book ever written on democracy and the best book written on America, Tocqueville sees our polity whole because he looks at it from the vantage point of Europe, in general, and France, in particular. In the third part of the seminar we think about American politics from the perspective of thoughtful commentators who feel only nominally included in the polity. Half in and half out, these extraordinary black American writers reveal fissures and fault lines in the American regime. We end the class with a discussion of America’s place in the world today – examining a speech by a writer who articulately raises challenges to our self-understanding that are inarticulately expressed today in rage and ranting from enemies of the United States.

It is designed for students of American politics and political theory. The principal themes include: 1) the nature of founding and its constitutive significance; 2) the relation of structure and power in American politics; 3) the meaning and significance of the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debate; 4) the philosophic background of the American founding; and 5) the relevance of the founding to debate to prospects for, and pathologies of, American politics today. We will conduct a close reading of the Madison’s Notes, of The Federalist, and selected Anti-Federalist writings. We will also study a larger and growing body of secondary literature on the constitutional convention, ratification and early American political thought."

      "This issue has been fixed. Captain America WW2 has started to become outpaced by his non-WW2 counterpart and while we want the two to feel different and each have their own specific uses, we also want to ensure they are kept within range of each other in terms of balance. To accomplish this, we’ve given WW2 Cap the ability to Stun with his Special 1 and Special 3 attacks, but kept his Bleed on Special 2 the same, giving him options during combat against non-bleeding champions. A bug that prevented Daredevil from triggering Armor Breaks from Heavy Attacks has been fixed and is now working as intended. Against non-bleeding champions: Critical Hits have a chance to Armor Break on Special Attacks. Increase range of Signature to 25% from 20%. Many players found Elektra’s signature ability lacked enough opportunities to use it. To remedy this, we’ve increased the range from 20% to 25%. Additionally, to help make Elektra unique from other skill champions, we’ve given her the ability to deal with naturally Bleed Immune champions. Note: This Armor Break only applies to champions naturally immune to bleed, such as Colossus and Ultron, and not to champions granted Bleed Immunity from Local or Link Nodes. Guillotine’s Bleed effect used to have a chance to activate from any given attack, meaning that it had to be kept quite weak to compensate for the frequency of triggers. We’ve made the switch to have her Bleed behave closer to existing champions, and in doing so have boosted the strength of the Bleed and have allowed it to stack. Norman Osborn overloads the Arc Reactor in his chest if Health drops below 10%, granting a large burst of power, with (18% - 48% ) Armor, Regeneration, and Power Gain. After that, his suit burns out and cannot trigger Armor Up, Armor Break or Stun and loses all base Armor. Many players didn’t like Iron Patriot’s old signature ability, feeling that due to the lack of Regeneration, it was considerably weaker than Iron Man’s. While we agreed, we didn’t want to just copy and paste his signature ability, but rather give him his own unique twist on the ability.",
      "New Summoner Boosts have arrived in the Loyalty Store; NEW Boost types, purchasable with Loyalty Points. Class specific Boosts, such as Mystic Champions restoring power after using Special Attacks 2 and 3, or Skill Champions boosting their Special Attack Damage. Defensive Boosts, where your Champions take reduced incoming Special 3 Attack Damage. Gain a temporary Arena Point boost with new Arena Boost items! Fixed an issue where, after Parrying certain Champion’s Special Attacks, your Champion would be stuck in a blocking state until the Special Attack finished. Fixed an issue where 90s Cyclops’ Armor Breaks would not remove Armor Ups. Fixed an issue with Scarlet Witch’s Signature Ability proc rate (previously, the % chance displayed did not match in-game functionality; this is now fixed). (Netflix) Daredevil’s Heavy Attack now has a chance to apply 2 stacks of Armor Break, instead of the previous 1 stack. When spending Battlechips to enter an Arena (such as the Tier 4 Basic or Alpha Catalyst Arena), there is now a confirmation popup. The Alliance Crystal now has a purchase limit that resets daily. Permanently increased the Alliance Crystal’s points in Summoner Advancement (from 30 to 300). Updates to Champion Special Attack animations, flow, and timing. 7.0.1 will be released within the next few days. A celebration message is sent to the War Room when an Alliance War battlegroup is cleared. Players can now tap directly on another node icon while the tile info popup is open (previously, the popup had to be closed before selecting another node). Alliance’s reward tier position is now highlighted in the Alliance War tier breakdown. In Attack Phase, players can view the score breakdown for both the battlegroup and overall. The “Place Your Defenders” text now disappears much faster after tapping on the screen. Mail messages now display the date they were sent. It should be much harder to accidentally tap the Units Store when closing a screen. Players can tap to skip the point animation in Versus mode again.",
      "• Payback and Unbreakable now display their maximum potential damage bonus. • Added detailed descriptions for Bleed Immunity and Poison Immunity. • Gamora: We’ve adjusted the scaling of her base Special Attack damage to ensure they scale up more similarly to other heroes. This also makes Gamora more reliant on her high Bleed damage, and improves the chances of opponents able to deal with her high Bleed. Vital Strike and Jade Assassin damage decreased by 10%. Godslayer damage increased by 10%. • Magik: Rewind is a game-changer for Magik that allows her to go up against foes like Gamora and Rewind off big Critical Hits and Bleed damage; however, the frequency of Rewind triggering was too low to be there when she needed it. Increased the likelihood Rewind triggers by +20% at all levels. Rewind now heals over one second instead of instantly. Fixed a bug allowing Magik to break out of an enemy combo using Rewind. It now only removes Status Effects. • Hulk: Given the riskiness of losing Health in certain game modes, Hulk’s anger-management provided too little help too late in the game. We’ve increased the Attack boost to ensure he’s appropriately scary in all game modes – as long as he’s angry! Increased Hulk Rage by +20% Attack at all ability levels. Arc Overload no longer causes Armor Break when it expires. • Vision: Added Poison Immunity to our robot friend. Arena tuning is an ongoing process. The team is continually making adjustments to Arenas to improve the experience. Ultron has infected The Contest! Many new Champions join the battle against Ultron. Quest through the new Ultron’s Assault Event. Wield new power with Summoner Masteries. Grow your Friend’s List with the new Social Hub.\nTeam up with your Alliance in new Events, Arenas, and more! Filter and sort your Stash. Fights have been optimized for performance improvements on all devices. Users can now filter through the items in their Stash. Fixed several issues where Hero Rating would fluctuate. Fixed a bug with Rhino and Juggernaut having 11-20% more Armor than intended.",
      "Overall, her PI has decreased by about 2%. • Decreased base Health and Attack by 2% each to bring his PI in line with other Champions without compromising Special Attack effectiveness. • Slightly increased base Health by 2% to bring his PI in line with other Champions. This change may result in a PI increase of up to 1%. • Fixed a bug with her Bleed ability scaling incorrectly. This has no effect on PI. • User's on iPhone 4 devices will no longer encounter a progression blocker after fighting Iron Man in the tutorial. • Fixed an issue where player's Hero would disappear after using a special move. • Fixed an issue where very rarely a character would lose all functionality when dashing. • Added additional Network support to better diagnose disconnects. The game should resolve and recover much more gracefully than in previous updates. • Adjusted some of the touch sensitivity while fighting. Heroes moves should feel more responsive. This is something that is going to be an ongoing process. Please let us know how you think it feels. • Fixed various issues with Chat. • We have updated Open GL versions/drivers for iOS devices that support Open GL 3.0. • User's will no longer receive delayed Game Center notifications. This caused some weirdness to occur while opening Crystals in the Crystal Vault. • The Crystal Vault has received another polish pass and should now feel much more responsive, thank you for all your feedback on this feature! • Many more minor bug fixes were included in this update. • Special Attack 1 base damage increased by +25% Attack Rating. • Heavy Attack base Power gained reduced to 63 points. We recently improved the functionality of Heavy Attacks, so they’re easier to use. Their base Power has been reduced to normal levels – previously, they generated Power at a higher rate to compensate for their difficult execution. Special Attacks have been adjusted to give the unlucky recipients more of a fighting chance. These changes bring these attacks in line with existing damage-to-power ratios.",
      "Resolved an issue with Class Masteries (specifically Mystic Dispersion) not functioning. The Juggernaut issue with his linked nodes not appearing in Act 4, Chapter 3, Quest 3 (4.3.3) has been fixed. Fixed a crash that occurs when a player who is not in an Alliance enters Alliance Wars through an outside link. Fixed a text issue where Alliance War specific descriptions would appear on the Alliance Quest “Select a Battlegroup” screen. Resolved ~20 various rare crashes and additional minor issues in different game modes. Fixed and optimized performance on the new Samsung S7. Fixed an Unknown Error that occurred rarely after a device was woken after going to sleep. Improved Performance(Frames Per Second) tracking per fight to help diagnose hitches/pauses/lag spikes during gameplay. Improved gesture tracking(Swipe, Tap, Hold) during low performance moments in combat. Fixed a rare crash that would sometimes occur when receiving a phone call while in combat. Tuned and updated many Champion Special Attack animations to improve timing and combat flow. Please see the expanded forum post HERE for a full list. Fixed She-Hulk’s Special Attacks being marked as a projectile (allowing Daredevil to evade them). Fixed an issue where the player would be stuck in place after parrying Captain America’s Special 1. Fixed an issue where chaining 2 medium attacks into Old Man Logan’s Special 2 would cause the first 2 strikes to miss opponents. Fixed an issue with Daredevil or Spider-man missing with a dash attack if Vision charges a heavy attack during the dash. Fixed an issue where some hidden information in Alliance Wars was visible. Fixed a display issue where Defender Placement percentage was not displaying all placed Alliance members. Resolved minor issue with the total Alliance’s score being displayed on the War Progress widget (now only displays the score of the battlegroup being viewed). Multiple minor Alliance War issues have also been fixed in this patch. Fixed a display issue where Shard amounts provided by defeating a boss displayed as double."

    "question": "Given the potential risks associated with bone marrow transplantation and the ongoing research into alternative treatment options, what is the most likely reason researchers are exploring umbilical cord blood as a potential donor source, considering the unique characteristics of both adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood?",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "The risk for specific individuals depends on current health status, age, and other factors. Because of the risks involved and the fact that beta thalassemia is a treatable condition, transplant physicians require a brother or sister donor who has an identically matched tissue type, called HLA type. HLA type refers to the unique set of proteins present on each individual's cells, which allows the immune system to recognize \"self\" from \"foreign.\" HLA type is genetically determined, so there is a 25% chance for two siblings to be a match. Transplant physicians and researchers are also investigating ways to improve the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation. Using newborn sibling umbilical cord blood—the blood from the placenta that is otherwise discarded after birth but contains cells that can go on to make bone marrow—seems to provide a safer and perhaps more effective source of donor cells. Donors and recipients may not have to be perfect HLA matches for a successful transplant using cord blood cells. Trials are also underway to determine the effectiveness of \"partial transplants,\" in which a safer transplant procedure is used to replace only a percentage of the affected individual's bone marrow. Other possible treatments on the horizon may include gene therapy techniques aimed at increasing the amount of normal hemoglobin the body is able to make. Hemoglobin H disease is a relatively mild form of thalassemia that may go unrecognized. It is not generally considered a condition that will reduce one's life expectancy. Education is an important part of managing the health of an individual with hemoglobin H disease. It is important to be able to recognize the signs of severe anemia that require medical attention. It is also important to be aware of the medications, chemicals, and other exposures to avoid due to the theoretical risk they pose of causing a severe anemia event. When severe anemia occurs, it is treated with blood transfusion therapy. For individuals with hemoglobin H disease, this is rarely required.",
      "Hemoglobin electrophoresis — A laboratory test that separates molecules based on their size, shape, or electrical charge. Hepatomegaly — An abnormally large liver. HLA type — Refers to the unique set of proteins called human leukocyte antigens. These proteins are present on each individual's cell and allow the immune system to recognize 'self' from 'foreign'. HLA type is particularly important in organ and tissue transplantation. Hydroxyurea — A drug that has been shown to induce production of fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin has a pair of gamma-globin molecules in place of the typical beta-globins of adult hemoglobin. Higher-than-normal levels of fetal hemoglobin can ameliorate some of the symptoms of thalassemia. Iron overload — A side effect of frequent blood transfusions in which the body accumulates abnormally high levels of iron. Iron deposits can form in organs, particularly the heart, and cause life-threatening damage. Jaundice — Yellowing of the skin or eyes due to excess of bilirubin in the blood. Mutation — A permanent change in the genetic material that may alter a trait or characteristic of an individual, or manifest as disease, and can be transmitted to offspring. Placenta — The organ responsible for oxygen and nutrition exchange between a pregnant mother and her developing baby. Red blood cell — Hemoglobin-containing blood cells that transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues. In the tissues, the red blood cells exchange their oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is brought back to the lungs to be exhaled. Screening — Process through which carriers of a trait may be identified within a population. Splenomegaly — Enlargement of the spleen. Because alpha thalassemia major is most often a condition that is fatal in the prenatal or newborn period, treatment has previously been focused on identifying affected pregnancies in order to provide appropriate management to reduce potential maternal complications. Pregnancy termination provides one form of management. Increased prenatal surveillance and early treatment of maternal complications is an approach that is appropriate for mothers who wish to continue their pregnancy with the knowledge that the baby will most likely not survive.",
      "For those with the hemoglobin H/Constant Spring form of the disease, the need for transfusions may be intermittent or ongoing, perhaps on a monthly basis and requiring desferoxamine treatment. Individuals with this more severe form of the disease may also have an increased chance of requiring removal of an enlarged and/or overactive spleen. Anemia — A blood condition in which the level of hemoglobin or the number of red blood cells falls below normal values. Common symptoms include paleness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Bilirubin — A yellow pigment that is the end result of hemoglobin breakdown. This pigment is metabolized in the liver and excreted from the body through the bile. Bloodstream levels are normally low; however, extensive red cell destruction leads to excessive bilirubin formation and jaundice. Bone marrow — A spongy tissue located in the hollow centers of certain bones, such as the skull and hip bones. Bone marrow is the site of blood cell generation. Bone marrow transplantation — A medical procedure used to treat some diseases that arise from defective blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Healthy bone marrow is extracted from a donor to replace the marrow in an ailing individual. Proteins on the surface of bone marrow cells must be identical or very closely matched between a donor and the recipient. Desferoxamine — The primary drug used in iron chelation therapy. It aids in counteracting the life-threatening buildup of iron in the body associated with long-term blood transfusions. Globin — One of the component protein molecules found in hemoglobin. Normal adult hemoglobin has a pair each of alpha-globin and beta-globin molecules. Heme — The iron-containing molecule in hemoglobin that serves as the site for oxygen binding. Hemoglobin — Protein-iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells and carries carbon dioxide away from the cells. Hemoglobin A — Normal adult hemoglobin that contains a heme molecule, two alpha-globin molecules, and two beta-globin molecules.",
      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts."

      "We have the Holy Spirit, but we still choose to disobey. In theory you should be able to live a perfect life after you’re saved, but because we’ve already been marked by sin in our lives and live in an imperfect world, we will never be perfect under our own power. What do we do then? Give up? Of course not! We beat our bodies into submission. We learn right and wrong from Scripture, and we challenge our motives day to day. But if we want to go the extra mile, we can’t do it alone. There will be times you trick yourself into thinking you’re doing what’s right. There will be times you misread Scripture and misunderstand what God expects. And to guard against those times you need to surround yourself with fellow believers. You need people who know you, who know the Word, and who are committed to following Jesus with you. They can provide that outside check to make sure sin isn’t getting the best of you. Because let’s face it: some days it’s hard to tell the difference between the Holy Spirit’s promptings and our own desires. Nothing can do better to counter that than other Spirit-filled people who bring a different perspective. We ended up talking a lot about sanctification today, but that’s because it’s how we cope with the effects of the Fall in our lives. I don’t ever want to teach about sin and suffering and death without also pointing to the hope we have in Christ! The sin we as Christians struggle with is our bad choices day to day. If you’re saved, all you can do is persevere in what’s right and help others to do the same. We’ll say more about suffering and death another time. My challenge to you is this: who do you have in your life who can give you that outside angle to your struggles and decisions? Where can you go to make sure you’re on the right path? If you’re not sure, start looking! We need each other more than ever. Isn’t it interesting how hard it is to remember the details of a story we’ve heard dozens of times? Our memories aren’t perfect. It sure helps having other people to lean on…\nHistorically speaking, the discussion of the effects of the Fall gets really fun with Augustine and Pelagius.",
      "It took a long time to get there. No, extreme depravity wasn’t the result of the Fall, but total depravity still is. Total depravity is the doctrine that says sin bent every part of man. Sin pollutes man’s reason, man’s emotions, man’s willpower, man’s desires, man’s imagination, man’s memories, man’s senses, man’s body, and even man’s conscience. Nothing is safe. Nothing is pure. And this is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. Remember that man was made in God’s image, unique among all creation. But sin now pollutes that image. It’s still present—we still can’t help but “image” our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God’s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil. Comparing Theories\nNow if we take a step back, we all recognize that we live in a broken world. Very few people would argue that everything is perfect, that sin, suffering, and death somehow don’t exist or aren’t really bad. We (generally) all agree that there’s a problem. But there’s little agreement about why it is the way it is. People who don’t believe in a literal Adam and Even tanking the human race are generally stuck. For example, if you only believe in the natural world, evil is just a part of nature. Death is a part of life. Suffering is a biochemical response to destructive conditions. And if you’re just one organism out of millions competing for resources, all you can really say is that you don’t like these things. They are distasteful. Maybe you’re hard-wired to show empathy with others because of some evolutionary imperative, but objectively speaking what can you say? Well, you can say lots I suppose, but you can’t be consistent without ending up a nihilist. Other religions have the same problem: either evil belongs as some part of the bigger cosmic plan or it’s an illusion. Either way, it’s hard to take evil seriously. Either it belongs in some way, or it doesn’t exist at all.",
      "Jesus, being fully God, lives a perfectly sinless life—a life not meriting death—and dies on our behalf, paying for all the sin of the world. Let that sink in for a moment: God dies. But the death of God becomes the death of sin, and the death of sin becomes the death of death. And death’s final defeat is announced through the resurrection of God back from the dead. The God of life is alive! And He offers eternal life to all. As Tim Keller likes to put it, Jesus died the death we deserved so that we could live the life He deserved. Because Jesus submitted to death on our behalf, our relationship with death gets really complicated. It’s still the enemy. It’s still the wages of sin. It’s still not good. But every good thing—salvation, resurrection, eternal life, peace with God—these all came from one great death: the Crucifixion. So now all death is bad, but that one death brought us everything good. We praise the God of life, but we celebrate His death. God took a horrible, terrible, rotten, no-good thing and redeemed it. I suppose that shouldn’t surprise us either. We may sometimes look like we’re rejoicing in death itself, but really we rejoice in that one death that God used to bring eternal life. Our problem isn’t that we sing about death too much—we probably don’t sing about it enough! But we have to keep it in the context of the bigger story. We can’t make any sense of the Crucifixion apart from the Fall, the Resurrection, and Return of Christ. This is the theme we see in the Book of Acts: God raised Jesus from the dead. It’s all about resurrection now! We baptize in the likeness of His death—and resurrection. We take the bread and cup to remember His death—all the while waiting for His return. In Romans, death takes on a whole new meaning: since our sins were buried with Christ, we are now alive to God and dead to sin. Spiritual death is over now. Death has become just a metaphor for our relationship with sin. But make no mistake, death didn’t just die spiritually. We might think that because we still see death all around us.",
      "(John 16:7–15 ESV) There’s a lot to unpack here, but first I just want you to notice: when we lost the Savior, we gained the Helper, and He’s exactly what we needed next. Even though Jesus fully paid for our sins, we need a Helper to teach us the perfect obedience that Jesus modeled, to realize the change that Jesus purchased for us. Now we get a fuller picture of what the Spirit of Truth has come to do. To the unbelieving world, He is a source of conviction, confronting sinners with the reality of who Jesus really was and what He did. To believers, He is a source of wisdom and knowledge. This is a ministry of words and truth. We usually call Him the Holy Spirit, which rightly emphasizes His character and the work that He does in our hearts, but He is also called the Spirit of Truth. He draws us back to the words Jesus spoke, which bear the Father’s authority. The Sanctifying Word\nThese days we’ve become cautious about putting our trust in words or staking claim to truth. We’re allowed to have our own truth, and we’re expected to have our own interpretations. But to go beyond this is to invite conflict. Some of us have also grown weary of knowledge because we’ve seen people devote themselves to a dead orthodoxy that devours truth and then does nothing with it. So we associate the Christian walk with a ministry of love and compassion and holiness—which it is—and try not to get too distracted by the rest. But it’s clear that Jesus spent a good deal of time ministering in words and teaching truth, and that the Holy Spirit is also committed to a ministry of words and truth. “Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me. These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” (John 14:24–26 ESV) When Jesus prays, He even emphasizes this before the Father: “Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.”",
      "Does this surprise you? He would much rather see the wicked turn from their ways—to repent and live. But those who will not get what they deserve. Sometimes if we’re not careful this is a way that we distort God’s character, as though God somehow hungers for death and blood. God isn’t pleased by animal sacrifice, but He requires some recompense for sin. God didn’t send the Flood on a whim but because evil on the earth had become unbearable. If we take death out of the context of grace and patience and kindness, we get a very wrong view of God. But because death is part of life in a fallen world, we sometimes get confused about our relationship with death on the one hand and God’s sovereignty on the other. The author of Ecclesiastes notes that people are just as dead as animals in the end. The wise man for all of his wisdom still ends up just as dead as the fool. The nice thing about being dead is you don’t have to live in fear of death anymore! It’s a bleak way to look at things, but not wrong. What’s the point of life if the only thing we can be sure of is death? If this is getting depressing, good! Sin is serious business and so is death. Christianity has a lot to say about death because it takes sin seriously. But there’s a whole lot left to be said. It turns out contrary to popular belief, death can be undone. Yes, you heard me: the end might not really be the end after all. Elijah and Elisha are both able to raise the dead. Jesus raises the dead. Jesus’ disciples raise the dead. Of course, these were all temporary. But it’s a start! God promises us that it gets better than this. In Isaiah 25, He promises to swallow up death forever. How is this possible?!? The wages of sin is death. A holy God can’t just get rid of death. He’d have to get rid of sin somehow. This is where everything gets turned on its head. This is that part in the movie where you fly through the black hole and end up in a different dimension, or where Alice jumps down the rabbit hole. God swallows up death by letting death swallow Him up."

The area also embraces former producers Albuskjell, Cod, Edda, Tor, West Ekofisk and Tommeliten G. These fields all lie within production licence 018 apart from Tommeliten G, which was operated by Statoil from 1976 to 2003. In all, 31 installations have been positioned in the Greater Ekofisk Area. First Norwegian offshore field\nEkofisk began production on 15 June 1971, following its discovery in the autumn of 1969. Development of the field has occurred in several phases. Its central facilities were installed during the early 1970s, with oil initially being buoy-loaded into tankers. From 1975, it has been piped to Teesside in the UK. The gas has been landed by pipeline at Emden in Germany from 1977. ekofisk i et nøtteskall, engelsk\nJacked up six metres\nThe water depth in the Greater Ekofisk Area is 70-75 metres. However, declining pressure in the Ekofisk reservoir over the years has caused the seabed to subside. Efforts began as early as 1985 to safeguard the installations against the effects of this development, and the steel platforms in the Ekofisk Complex were jacked up by six metres in 1987. In addition, a protective breakwater was installed around the Ekofisk tank in 1989. The rate of seabed subsidence has declined sharply in recent years. Waterflooding improves recovery\nThe Ekofisk 2/4 K water injection platform became operational in December 1987 as part of efforts to improve Ekofisk’s recovery factor – the share of petroleum in place actually produced. Waterflooding capacity on the field to help maintain reservoir pressure was later expanded several times, and had reached just over 500 000 barrels per day by 2019. Measured in barrels of oil equivalent, the recovery factor on Ekofisk has risen from an original estimate of 17 per cent to over 50 per cent.",
      "The problem with this approach arose when weather conditions meant the tankers had to cast off from the buoys because of strong winds or high waves. The rig then had to shut down production from the wellheads immediately. Given the weather conditions found on Ekofisk, output regularly had to cease. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason. Output began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day.

The pipeline was divided into three equal lengths, with Norpipe GNSC B11 positioned at the end of the first third to maintain pressure as and when required. From there, the gas then travelled the next third of the distance to the second and virtually identical compressor platform, H7. This was also responsible for maintaining pressure, but additional compression was seldom required on this final leg of the journey to Emden. Both platforms stood on the German continental shelf, but 48 kilometres of the pipeline also ran across the Danish North Sea sector. The pipeline is trenched or covered with sand. On its final approach to the coast of East Friesland, it passes beneath the island of Juist before making landfall north of Emden.

Drilling began there in 1974 to depths of 4 500-5 000 metres, but pressure and temperature in the wells were too high for testing with the available equipment. The first production well was not drilled and tested until 1988, followed by a second in 1990. Both yielded very promising results, and the field came on stream in May 1993.

Its official inauguration took place on 9 June, with initial test output commencing on 15 June. Full production began on 8 July. The rig was chosen because it was available on the market. Established equipment for processing oil and gas was tailored to the limited space on board. Separate flowlines carried wellstreams from four subsea wells. Oil, gas and water were separated on board, with the gas flared and the oil piped to two buoys for loading into shuttle tankers. Work on the process equipment was relatively simple. The problem was to tailor it to the rig. The subsea wellheads had to be reinforced to meet the demands posed by the North Sea, and a buoy loading system needed to be developed for waters where this technology had never been used before. To gain time, it was decided that the three appraisal wells drilled by Ocean Viking to map the extent of the field – in addition to the discovery well – would be completed for production.

      "Additional details regarding the specific experiments are reported in the Figure Legends. To examine the expression behavior of genomic repeats upon AA starvation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis taking advantage of an intramural sequencing facility. HeLa-OA1 cells were cultured in normal medium (for 6-30-120 hours) or in absence of Met/Cys (for 6-15-30-72-120 hours). Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Sigma) to preserve transcripts of both small and long sizes (from Alu, of about 0.3 kb, to Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements, LINEs, and ERVs, up to 6–8 kb long), DNase treated to avoid contamination of genomic DNA, and processed for NGS sequencing by Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 protocol and HiSeq 2000 apparatus. Raw sequence data (10–20 M reads/sample) were aligned to the human genome (build hg19) with SOAPSplice . Read counts over repeated regions, defined by RepeatMasker track from UCSC genome browser , were obtained using bedtools suite . Normalization factors and read dispersion (d) were estimated with edgeR , variation of abundance during time was analyzed using maSigPro package , fitting with a negative binomial distribution (Θ = 1/d, Q = 0.01), with a cutoff on stepwise regression fit r2 = 0.7. Read counts were transformed to RPKM for visualization purposes. The expression of the OA1 transgene and HDAC4, which are progressively up- and down-regulated during starvation, respectively , were used as internal controls. For genomic repeat analysis, reads belonging to repetitive elements were classified according to RepeatMasker and assigned to repeat classes (total number in the genome = 21), families (total number in the genome = 56) and finally subfamilies (total number in the genome = 1396), each including a variable number of genomic loci (from a few hundred for endogenous retroviruses, up to several thousand for Alu). Repeat subfamilies were then clustered according to their expression pattern in starved vs control cells, by maSigPro using default parameters, and repeats classes or families that are significantly enriched in each cluster, compared to all genomic repeats, were identified by applying a Fisher Exact test (using scipy.stats, a statistical module of Python).",
      "In all cases, the integrated transgenes are under the control of the CMV promoter in the context of a pcDNA3.1 plasmid, are partially silenced, and can be efficiently upregulated by HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A, TSA; ref. and S3A, S3B and S4A Figs), indicating that their expression is controlled at least in part by epigenetic mechanisms, as previously described . To establish whether the reactivation response results from the shortage of specific AAs only, such as Met/Cys, or it is triggered by any AA deprivations, we cultured HeLa-OA1, HeLa-GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells for 24–48 hours with a battery of media deprived of EAAs or semi-EAAs, including Met/Cys, Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys, and His. As negative controls, cells were cultured in full medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and in a medium deprived of Ala, a non-essential AA. The expression of the transgene transcript was then evaluated by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 3, and in S3C and S4B Figs, most EAA-deficiencies induced reactivation of the OA1 or GFP transgenes in all four cell lines, with the notable exception of Trp deprivation, which consistently resulted in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes. Indeed, despite some variability, Met/Cys deficiency, but also Thr, Val, Tyr, and His deprivation always gave an efficient response, while Leu, Gln and Lys elicited evident responses in some cases, but not in others. Depletion of Phe gave results comparable to Tyr deprivation, however it significantly altered multiple reference genes used for normalization and therefore was eventually omitted from the analysis (not shown). Finally, in the above experiments we used a combined Met/Cys deficiency, to avoid the potential sparing of Met by Cys  and for consistency with our previous studies . Nevertheless, the analysis of single Met or Cys starvation, both at the protein and transcript levels, revealed an exclusive role of Met deprivation in transgene reactivation, consistent with the notion that Cys is not an EAA (S3D and S3E Fig).",
      "Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 . These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic “parasites” anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming \"endogenized\" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements. HeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere."

      "Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse. Ohio’s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky’s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent. The DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation’s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida’s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma’s renewed offer to help pay for it. Scott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it. Attorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott’s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida’s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law. Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, “because (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place. Right?” In Greenup, an infuriated Cooper told a reporter, “In my opinion, (Scott’s) getting money from somewhere. He has to be.” A few days later, recalled Cooper, “A lieutenant with the state police I’d been talking to down there called me, said, ‘Man, just a head’s up: I wouldn’t come to Florida.’”",
      "A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car. Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state. Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies. Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family. At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. Pharmacy delivers oxy ‘pot of gold’\nIt would be hard to overstate Florida’s role in feeding the country’s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.",
      "Skidmore was wary of opioid painkillers, though, one reason her willingness in 2009 to work with Purdue was surprising. But she did it to get Florida’s dormant drug monitoring database up and running. Then a state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties, Skidmore recalled that, “They came to me and said, ‘Could you help get it across the finish line?’ ”\nOxyContin and prescription opioids, a serious problem in 2002, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years. Broward alone had more pain clinics than it had McDonald’s. Deaths tied to oxycodone had exploded, up by 263 percent since the prescription monitoring database had first been proposed and killed. Overdoses from prescription opioids were claiming more than seven lives a day. “By God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it,” Skidmore said. Skidmore believed a database wasn’t going to resolve the underlying addiction crisis. Still, it was a start. Not a silver bullet, but “maybe silver buckshot,” she said. The database law passed with gaping loopholes. No health care professional would have to report opioid prescriptions or check the database before prescribing more, and the state refused to pay for it. “Just to get that one little piece … took nine years of filing bills and then it had no teeth,” Skidmore said. “And it should have been the easiest piece.” Where Was The DEA and Everyone Else? The DEA all but wrung its hands over Florida’s lethal inaction. The agency ticked off a devil’s brew of regulatory loopholes: Florida’s Health Department regulated health care professionals but not pain clinics. The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration regulated pain clinics that accepted insurance, but pill mills were most often on a cash-only basis. And the prescription monitoring database, mired in a vendor dispute, remained stalled. In early 2011, when Gov. Rick Scott took office, just one drug — oxycodone — was tied to six fatal overdoses a day."

      "In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years. In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood."

      "At later times, depletion and\ngas-phase reactions with more complex species may enter into this\ncycle. At the cloud edge the interstellar UV radiation\ninstantaneously dissociates CO despite its self-shielding,\nre-enriching the gas with elemental carbon. The transformation of C$_2$H into CO and other species proceeds\nefficiently in dense regions, in particular in the ``warm'' model\nwhere endothermic reactions result in rich molecular complexity of the\ngas (see Fig.~\\ref{model}). In contrast, in the ``cold'' 10\\,K model\ngas-grain interactions and surface reactions become important. As a\nresult, a large fraction of oxygen is locked in water ice that is hard\nto desorb ($E_{\\rm des} \\sim 5500$~K), while half of the elemental\ncarbon goes to volatile methane ice ($E_{\\rm des} \\sim 1300$~K). Upon\nCRP heating of dust grains, this leads to much higher gas-phase\nabundance of C$_2$H in the cloud core for the cold model compared to\nthe warm model. The effect is not that strong for less dense regions\nat larger radii from the center. Since the C$_2$H emission is anti-correlated with the dust continuum\nemission in the case of IRAS\\,18089-1732 (Fig.\\,\\ref{18089}), we do\nnot have the H$_2$ column densities to quantitatively compare the\nabundance profiles of IRAS\\,18089-1732 with our model. However, data\nand model allow a qualitative comparison of the spatial structures. Estimating an exact evolutionary time for IRAS\\,18089-1732 is hardly\npossible, but based on the strong molecular line emission, its high\ncentral gas temperatures and the observed outflow-disk system\n\\citep{beuther2004a,beuther2004b,beuther2005c}, an approximate age of\n$5\\times10^4$\\,yr appears reasonable. Although dynamical and chemical\ntimes are not necessarily exactly the same, in high-mass star\nformation they should not differ to much: Following the models by\n\\citet{mckee2003} or \\citet{krumholz2006b}, the luminosity rises\nstrongly right from the onset of collapse which can be considered as a\nstarting point for the chemical evolution.",

The\ngas-grain chemical model by \\citet{vasyunin2008} with the desorption\nenergies and surface reactions from \\citet{garrod2006} is used. Gas-phase reaction rates are taken from RATE\\,06 \\citep{woodall2007},\ninitial abundances, were adopted from the ``low metal'' set of\n\\citet{lee1998}. Figure \\ref{model} presents the C$_2$H abundances for the three models\nat two different time steps: (a) 100\\,yr, and (b) in a more evolved\nstage after $5\\times10^4$\\,yr. The C$_2$H abundance is high toward the\ncore center right from the beginning of the evolution, similar to\nprevious models (e.g., \\citealt{millar1985,herbst1986,turner1999}). During the evolution, the C$_2$H abundance stays approximately\nconstant at the outer core edges, whereas it decreases by more than\nthree orders of magnitude in the center, except for the cold $T=10$~K\nmodel. The C$_2$H abundance profiles for all three models show\nsimilar behavior. The chemical evolution of ethynyl is determined by relative removal\nrates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions into molecules like CO, OH,\nH$_2$O. Light ionized hydrocarbons CH$^+_{\\rm n}$ (n=2..5) are quickly\nformed by radiative association of C$^+$ with H$_2$ and hydrogen\naddition reactions: C$^+$ $\\rightarrow$ CH$_2^+$ $\\rightarrow$\nCH$_3^+$ $\\rightarrow$ CH$_5^+$.  The protonated methane reacts with\nelectrons, CO, C, OH, and more complex species at later stage and\nforms methane. The CH$_4$ molecules undergo reactive collisions with\nC$^+$, producing C$_2$H$_2^+$ and C$_2$H$_3^+$. An alternative way to\nproduce C$_2$H$_2^+$ is the dissociative recombination of CH$_5^+$\ninto CH$_3$ followed by reactions with C$^+$.  Finally, C$_2$H$_2^+$\nand C$_2$H$_3^+$ dissociatively recombine into CH, C$_2$H, and\nC$_2$H$_2$. The major removal for C$_2$H is either the direct\nneutral-neutral reaction with O that forms CO, or the same reaction\nbut with heavier carbon chain ions that are formed from C$_2$H by\nsubsequent insertion of carbon.",
      "(Note that the\nMacDonald \\& Vennes (1991) ONe white dwarf atmosphere model was also\nattempted, but yielded a marginally worse fit than the CO white dwarf\natmosphere model; only the CO atmosphere model has been used in the\nsubsequent analysis). It is well known (e.g. Krautter et al.\\ 1996) that, because of the\nenergy-dependent opacity in the white dwarf atmosphere, fits to super\nsoft source novae spectra with black body models give larger fluxes\nand lower temperatures than atmosphere models fit to the same spectra,\nand this is seen in the present case. Thus the black body model\nrequires a larger $N_{\\rm H}$ to fit the same data than the atmosphere\nmodel, as is seen. The model normalizations, corrected for the removal\nof the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate\ndistance to the source. If we assume a typical emitting region for\nthe white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10$^{9}$\\,cm,\nthen, for the black body model, this distance turns out to be\n20$^{+31}_{-10}$\\,kpc. The effects discussed above however can lead to\nusage of the black body model giving rise to an underestimation of the\ndistance. For the white dwarf atmosphere model, a larger distance of\n71$^{+27}_{-23}$\\,kpc is obtained. Both estimates are consistent with\nthe distance to the LMC ($\\sim$50\\,kpc, see Section~6), and assuming a\ndistance of 50\\,kpc, the black body derived flux corresponds to a\n(pile-up corrected) 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity of\n1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 20 575 700,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f1.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton Slew spectrum of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from\n  XMM-Newton revolution 1210.

      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads.",
      "When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out. At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees. You can also send me email at: mikemims@pacbell.net if you have any questions or want to share your ideas.

      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

      "I would compare it to the story of the miller’s daughter. On the first day, I was told that the employee I was to be replacing would stick around for a week to train me. At noon that day, having shown me where everything was and how to use the coffee maker, she got up from her chair, smiled, and told me she thought I could “handle it,” then left. At one o’clock, the plant manager came over to my desk followed by several “production” workers. They brought cart loads of microfilm, on rolls, in little white boxes. I was to label all of those boxes, three carts, piled high. This job had gotten held up, he explained, it would be “great!” if it could go out today. Did I think I could get them done by 4 o’clock? I wanted to make everybody happy, so said I yes without thinking, and set to work loading the labels into the typewriter. It was a disaster. I had never typed anything like those labels before – typing class had been all about letters and envelopes, columns and reports. The labels skittered all over the platen, getting glue all over the inside of the typewriter. About every 50 or so labels, the platen had to be taken out and cleaned with alcohol. I typed and typed. By 3 o’clock I knew I was in trouble. The production workers had come over to my desk to help me affix the sticky labels. We were nervous, labels were getting screwed up. At 3:30 the office manager and receptionist came back to my desk to help with the labels. I typed and typed, and tried not to cry. We didn’t make it. The plant manager was flustered. The salesman who’d promised the job was really pissed off, he said mean things. I apologized again and again, they told me it wasn’t all my fault, but could I please be more careful what I committed myself to in future. I could tell they also expected me to get a hell of a lot faster, but they were just trying to be nice. So, I got faster. I came in early in the morning and worked through lunch until I got better at my job. I had signed up for a typing job, nobody had described all the weird stuff they expected me to type.",
      "It started with typing and labeling, not only sticky labels, but microfiche jackets. They have a little quarter inch tall label strip across the top that chips and peels if you aren’t careful loading them into the typewriter, and strips or frames of 35 and 16 mm film that falls out in your typewriter. Then there were the three-part work orders, with carbon paper, and the three-part shipping labels, also with carbon paper. There were the mistakes – whole orders that had been indexed incorrectly, and therefore typed incorrectly, and therefore had to be corrected and typed all over again. I won’t describe what I had to go through to correct microfiche labels, it was too stupid. I hated doing that, so I asked for my own little “eye-loup” – a little magnifier that you hold up to a light to look at the tiny little page numbers on the film – to make sure the cards had been indexed correctly before I typed them. I’m not perfect, but I know I’m competent, cause I kept that job for five years while I watched others get fired, for everything from showing up late to breaking expensive equipment to stealing. I was given new jobs and increased responsibility as time went by. I got good job reviews from my supervisors, and good raises. Morale was high, we liked our co-workers and our managers, we felt like a team. Our customers were nice to us too. We worked for cities and counties, hospitals, banks – anybody who needed to keep records. We were trusted to handle confidential records, like people’s medical records. As we handled these confidential files we were simply told, “Don’t look at them,” so we didn’t. I left in 1984 in finish school. Over the next decade computers killed the microfilm industry, and the company went out of business. Excuse me if I compare my experiences in the private sector with stuff I’ve seen coming out of our city $taff. I keep waiting for some professional behavior, some professional accountability out of the people who run our town, and I start to wonder if I will ever get it.",

We had a lively discussion down at the library yesterday about how we are going to fight the phone tax increase in November. The key here is to inform the public. $taff has already done their best to make this measure confusing and deceptive, actually writing into the measure that it will lower taxes. They mean, they are lowering the rate half a cent, but of course, this half-cent will be an ice cube in hell when they apply the tax to all the new stuff this measure allows – starting with cell phones, texting, paging, and adding whatever new technology comes along. All the voter needs to know is, this measure will raise his/her taxes, noticeably. Even people on welfare will pay this tax, even though they qualify for the rate-assistance plans offered by the phone companies – utility tax is based on the total bill, before the adjustment for the rate assistance. And, this tax includes those prepaid phone cards. The hardest hit will be commercial customers. A friend of mine who owns a little manufacturing business in town tells me the city of Chico thinks all business owners are “rich sugar daddies”.

      "I’m sitting here in disbelief of the attack I just watched Mary Goloff and Jim Walker wage on Mark Sorensen at city council tonight. I couldn’t make the meeting, so I have been watching it via computer. Sorensen had been challenged by a smarmy Jim Walker to list what changes he would make to balance the budget. Sorensen carefully began to explain that city funds had been depleted by millions over the last few years, with escalating costs leaving revenues in the dirt. He also explained that the lion’s share of our expenses are “operating costs,” meaning, salaries. He also carefully explained that there were programs we simply could not afford anymore, meaning, salaries. Mary Goloff could be heard heckling him off microphone. If you or I did what she was doing we’d be asked to leave the room, possibly with police escort. But Mayor Schwab just sat there looking at Goloff, saying nothing. Goloff finally got on mike, interrupted Sorensen, and asked him to be specific. So, Sorensen offered housing, saying it had been a mistake to undertake so many housing projects, and he also specified the arts programs – such as the requirement that any capital project include one percent of the total cost of that project be added for art. At this point Goloff began to interrupt Sorensen. She started heckling him about how “we all agree” that the arts are important, yadda, yadda. She just kept at Sorensen, not allowing him to answer any of her out-there questions, until Sorensen asked her to stop interrupting him. After a quick exchange Walker butted in to attack Sorensen. Out of nowhere, Walker bashed Sorensen about wanting to spend more money on the police department, asking Sorensen where he would get the money to hire more police. This question was off base, Sorensen hadn’t even gotten that far before Goloff had completely derailed him. Jim Walker is just sitting out his time, he seems to be enjoying himself at all of our expense. He, like so many “public servants,” seems to think he is elected to do what he wants, what seems like “the right thing” in his fairy tale mind, instead of carry out the law.",

And she has expectable stuff – over 80 percent of her budget is payroll. She doesn’t have that many emergencies. The biggest emergency she’s had lately, is that the state has taken back the fund she’s been mis-using – the RDA. She was paying salaries and benefits out of a fund that’s supposed to be reserved for emergency public works projects. In other words, she’s been dipping into the till to pay her own salary!",
      "The others have been mum to the public, but I’m guessing they will support it. Holcombe, Schwab, Goloff, Walker, Gruendl – and Evans? – are all banking on more revenues to rescue the city from the Shit Creek they’ve floated us up. Evans, while he will admit we’re in deep shit, will not offer so much as a suggestion of a paddle. He seems to be holding back until after he gets himself safely re-elected in November. Then he’s got a year to get that sales tax voted in and three years to make the public forget he had anything to do with it. Well Bob, is that what you’re up to? I’ll say, if he were at least honest, I might be able to hold my nose and support him, but this game he’s playing is a real turn-off.

I know, there’s probably a perfectly legitimate explanation for this. Debbie Presson isn’t sure why the feed is off, but she’s got somebody working on it. Not yesterday though, cause she was out of her office. I’ll tell you what else is interesting – there haven’t been any of those morning meetings lately – in fact, it looks like all the committee meetings for July are CANCELLED. In fact, there hasn’t been an “Economic Development” committee meeting for months that I’m aware. For all intents and purposes, the city of Chico seems to be on Summer Vacation! How nice for them! But, as you see, the town runs along without them. In fact, I’m wishing the public works department would also take a hike – they’re TOO BUSY right now, tearing up the streets Downtown. Oh well, the college students have “gone home” – what do we need Downtown for when the college students have gone home? That seems to be the gist of if – the city of Chico is here to serve the college students. The rest of us can just get along – as long as we keep paying our taxes, nobody will bother us!"

      "For a molecular Rydberg gas, neutral fragmentation, occurs in concert with electron-impact ionization, three-body recombination and electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering. Neutral dissociation combined with radial expansion in a shaped distribution of charged particles, can give rise to striking effects of self-assembly and spatial correlation \\cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}. The formation of a molecular ultracold plasma requires the conditions of local temperature and density afforded by a high mach-number skimmed supersonic molecular beam. Such a beam propagates at high velocity in the laboratory, with exceedingly well-defined hydrodynamic properties, including a propagation-distance-dependent density and sub-Kelvin temperature in the moving frame \\cite{MSW_tutorial}. The low-temperature gas in a supersonic molecular beam differs in three important ways from the atomic gas laser-cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The milli-Kelvin temperature of the gas of ground-state NO molecules entrained in a beam substantially exceeds the sub-100 micro-Kelvin temperature of laser-cooled atoms in a MOT. However, the evolution to plasma tends to erase this distinction, and the two further characteristics that distinguish a beam offer important advantages for ultracold plasma physics:  Charged-particle densities in a molecular beam can exceed those attainable in a MOT by orders of magnitude. A great many different chemical substances can be seeded in a free-jet expansion, and the possibility this affords to form other molecular ultracold plasmas, introduces interesting and potentially important new degrees of freedom governing the dynamics of their evolution. \\subsection{Supersonic molecular beam temperature and particle density}\n\nSeeded in a skimmed supersonic molecular beam, nitric oxide forms different phase-space distributions in the longitudinal (propagation) and transverse coordinate dimensions. As it propagates in $z$, the NO molecules reach a terminal laboratory velocity, $u_{\\parallel}$, of about 1400 ${\\rm ms^{-1}}$, which varies with the precise seeding ratio.",
      "In the wings, momentum redistribution owing to cycles of ion-Rydberg charge transfer retards radial expansion \\cite{Pohl2003,PPR}. By redirecting electron energy from ambipolar acceleration to $\\pm x$ plasma motion, NO$^+$ to NO$^*$ charge exchange dissipates electron thermal energy. This redistribution of energy released in the avalanche of the Rydberg gas to plasma, causes the ellipsoidal Rydberg gas to bifurcate \\cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}, forming very long-lived, separating charged-particle distributions. We capture the electron signal from these recoiling volumes on an imaging detector as pictured in Figure \\ref{fig:bifurcation}. Here, momentum matching preserves density and enables ions and Rydberg molecules to relax to positions that minimize potential energy, building spatial correlation. The semi-classical description of avalanche and relaxation outlined above forms an important point of reference from which to interpret our experimental observations. The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution. This initial condition has an evident effect on the evolution dynamics. We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma using a realistic, ellipsoidal representation of the ion/electron and Rydberg densities \\cite{haenelCP}. No combination of initial conditions can produce a simulation that conforms classically with the state of arrested relaxation we observe experimentally. \\subsection{A molecular ultracold plasma state of arrested relaxation} Thus, we find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydberg molecules in the wings of the ellipsoid quenches the ion-Rydberg molecule relative velocity distribution.",
      "This sequence of steps gives rise to a remarkable mechanics of self-assembly, in which the kinetic energy of initially formed hot electrons and ions drives an observed separation of plasma volumes. These dynamics redistribute ion momentum, efficiently channeling electron energy into a reservoir of mass-transport. This starts a process that evidently anneals separating volumes to a state of cold, correlated ions, electrons and Rydberg molecules. We have devised a three-dimensional spin model to describe this arrested state of the ultracold plasma in terms of two, three and four-level dipole-dipole energy transfer interactions (spin flip-flops), together with Ising interactions that arise from the concerted pairwise coupling of resonant pairs of dipoles \\cite{SousMBL,SousNJP}. The Hamiltonian includes the effects of onsite disorder owing to the broad spectrum of states populated in the ensemble and the unique electrostatic environment of every dipole. Extending ideas developed for simpler systems \\cite{Burin1,Sondhi}, one can make a case for slow dynamics, including an arrest in the relaxation of NO Rydberg molecules to predissociating states of lower principal quantum number. Systems of higher dimension ought to thermalize by energy transfer that spreads from rare but inevitable ergodic volumes (Griffiths regions) \\cite{Sarang2, Roeck_griffith, RareRegions_rev, Thermal_inclusions}. However, a feature in the self-assembly of the molecular ultracold plasma may preclude destabilization by rare thermal domains: Whenever the quenched plasma develops a delocalizing Griffiths region, the local predissociation of relaxing NO molecules promptly proceeds to deplete that region to a void of no consequence. In summary, the classical dynamics of avalanche and bifurcation appear to create a quenched condition of low temperature and high disorder in which dipole-dipole interactions drive self-assembly to a localized state purified by the predissociation of thermal regions. We suggest that this state of the quenched ultracold plasma offers an experimental platform for studying quantum many-body physics of disordered systems."

      "A Brief History of Benjamin Franklin's Residences on Craven Street, London: 1757 - 1775 - Journal of the American Revolution\nBenjamin Franklin House, 36 Craven St, London. (Photo by Elliott Brown | Wikimedia Commons) If one looked into Benjamin Franklin’s time on Craven Street, they might initially believe he lived at 36 Craven Street the entirety of his two stays in London based on the plethora of articles on the internet that say so. If they dug a little deeper they might read that he lived at No. 27 Craven Street, previously numbered 7, but now numbered 36; or that he lived exclusively at No. 7 Craven Street; or that he lived in multiple residences on Craven Street; or that he moved out of No. 36 to another house on Craven Street and then moved back into No. 36 the last year of his residence. What is one to believe with all of the conflicting accounts? What does the historical record have to say about Franklin’s time on Craven Street? Figure 1. Spur Alley 1685. “A map of the parish of St Martins in the Fields, taken from ye last survey, with additions (1685)”. (© The British Library Board, Shelfmark: Maps Crace Port. 13.2, Item number: 2) Before Craven Street existed there was Spur Alley, a narrow passageway sandwiched between the Hungerford Market to the north (now Charing Cross Station) and Scotland Yard and the Northumberland House and Garden to the south. It was flanked on both ends by major thoroughfares, the Strand on the west, connecting Westminster to London by road, and the River Thames on the east, not only connecting the two cities to each other and to Southwark on the south side of the Thames, but connecting the entire metropolis to the rest of the world. Being located in the City of Westminster, Spur Alley had escaped the devastation of the Great Fire of London in 1666 leaving its wooden structures, built in the early part of seventeenth century, intact, but also in dire need of restoration or demolition. “The ratebooks show that during the last thirty years or so of their existence the houses in Spur Alley were in a very bad condition.",
      "An examination of the Westminster Rate Books for the years 1774 and 1775 reveal them living not at No. 7 on the west side of Craven Street as one might expect from the overwhelming consensus of nineteenth century guidebooks and biographies, but surprisingly at No. 1.[48] The controversy of No. 7 being torn down was all for naught as it had never been Franklin’s residence. Sir George was correct on that point. Unfortunately, No. 1 was torn down as well in the early part of the twentieth century. The first time No. 1 is mentioned as Franklin’s second residence is in the Survey of London: Volume 18, St Martin-in-The-Fields II: the Strand published by the London County Council in 1937, ironically the same County Council that had declared No. 36 as Franklin’s only residence twenty-four years earlier. From 1748 until 1772 Margaret ‘Stephenson’ occupied this house [No. 27 (36)], and it was there that Benjamin Franklin settled after his arrival in London in 1757 as Agent to the General Assembly of Pennsylvania … In October, 1772, Mrs. Stevenson and Franklin removed to No. 1, Craven Street (now demolished), and No. 36 was for the next two years occupied by William Hewson, surgeon, who had married Mary Stevenson.[49] In the spring of 1774, William Hewson died unexpectedly of septicemia two weeks after cutting himself while dissecting a cadaver. Polly was left to care for their two young sons and was pregnant with a daughter she would give birth to in August of the same year. Is it possible that Margaret and Benjamin moved back into No. 27 to assist Polly after the death of her husband as suggested in The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin?[50]\nIf the Westminster Rate Books are to be believed, the answer is no. For the year 1774, the Rate Books list Margaret Stevenson at No. 1 and William Hewson at No. 27. For the year 1775, they list Margaret Stevenson at No. 1 and Magnus Falkner (Falconer/Falconar) at No. 27. Magnus was William’s assistant at the anatomy school and fiancé to William’s sister, Dorothy.",
      "Credit must go to D. H. Montgomery in 1896 and Sir George in 1913 for setting the record partially straight by placing Franklin at No. 27(36). In 1937, the London County Council gave us the first accurate account of Franklin’s residences on Craven Street in the Survey of London at No. 27(36) and No. 1. It has been shown conclusively that No. 27 was never previously numbered 7. It was, however, renumbered 36 in 1792 after ten additional houses were built at the southern end of the street and remains No. 36 to this day.

      "Thus, there is no evidence of a unique overall pattern for the association between the power-law exponents and age or market capitalization followed by a significant part of the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the 94% highest density intervals for σ A ([0.87, 0.93] for positive and [0.63, 0.70] for negative returns) and σ C ([0.57, 0.61] for positive and [0.49, 0.52] for negative returns) indicate that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the evolution of power-law exponents associated with large price variations (see Supplementary Figure for the distributions of σ A and σ C ). Figure illustrates these heterogeneous behaviors by plotting the posterior probability distributions for the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age (A) and market capitalization (C) for the top 20 digital assets, where cryptocurrencies which are significantly affected (that is, the 94% highest density intervals for A or C do not include the zero) by these quantities are highlighted in boldface. Even this small selection of digital  currencies already presents a myriad of patterns. First, we observe that the power-law exponents of a few top 20 cryptocurrencies are neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. That is the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB, rank 13) and Dai (DAI, rank 11) for both positive and negative returns, UNUS SED LEO (LEO, rank 18) and Polkadot (DOT, rank 12) for the positive returns, and USDCoin (USDC, rank 4) and Solana (SOL, rank 9) for negative returns. There are also cryptocurrencies with exponents positively or negatively correlated only with market capitalization. Examples include Tether (USDT, rank 3) and Dogecoin (DOGE, rank 10), for which the power-law exponents associated with positive returns increase with market capitalization, and Binance USD (BUSD, rank 6), for which power-law exponents associated with positive and negative returns decrease with market capitalization. We also observe cryptocurrencies for which age and market capitalization simultaneously affect the power-law exponents.",
      "Using a hierarchical Bayesian linear model, we have also simultaneously investigated the overall market characteristics and asset-specific tendencies regarding the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents. We have found that the cryptocurrency market is highly heterogeneous regarding the trends exhibited by each cryptocurrency; however, only a small fraction of cryptocurrencies (10%) have power-law exponents neither correlated with age nor market capitalization. These associations have been mostly ignored by the current literature and are probably related to the still-early developmental stage of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Overall, 36% of cryptocurrencies present trends that do not systematically contribute to increasing or decreasing their power-law exponents as they age and grow in market capitalization. On the other hand, for 26% of cryptocurrencies, aging and growing market capitalization are both associated with a reduction in their power-law exponents, thus contributing to the rise in the frequency of large price variations in their dynamics. Only about 28% of cryptocurrencies present trends in which the power-law exponents increase with age and market capitalization, favoring thus large price variations to become less likely. These results somehow juxtapose with findings about the increasing informational efficiency of the cryptocurrency market . In fact, if on the one hand the cryptocurrency market is becoming more informationally efficient, then on the other our findings indicate that there is no clear trend toward decreasing the risks of sizable variations in the prices of most considered cryptoassets. In other words, risk and efficiency thus appear to be moving towards different directions in the cryptocurrency market. To conclude, we hope that our findings will contribute significantly to the better understanding of the dynamics of large price variations in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, and not just for a small subset of selected digital assets, which is especially relevant due to the diminishing concentration of market capitalization among the top digital currencies, and also because of the considerable impact these new assets may have in our increasingly digital economy.",
      "Panels (c) and (d) show the distributions of these median exponents when considering the top 2000 and the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively. We observe that the distributions of α+ and α− tend to shift toward larger values when considering the largest cryptoassets. number of return observations (between 100 and 300 days) and filtering out cryptoassets with missing observations (Supplementary Figures ). Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( α+ ) and negative ( α− ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where α+ = 4.50 and α− = 2.99. It is worth noticing that the variance of large price movements σ 2 is finite only for α > 3, as the integral σ 2 ∼ ∞ r min r 2 p(r)dr diverges outside this interval. Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns. The medians of these typical exponents are respectively 2.78 and 3.11 for positive and negative returns."

      "Strictly speaking, those TNE intensity and effect descriptions that do not account for the research perspective are not correct. Do not explain the research perspective, the corresponding is not dependent on the research perspective. Numerical simulations and results\n\nIn this section, we first validate the DBM code by comparing the DBM results with experimental results. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on the dynamic process and TNE behaviors on SBI are investigated. Comparison with experimental results\n\nIn the following part, we use a first-order two-fluid DBM to simulate the interaction between a planar shock wave with a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubbles, and compare the DBM results with the experimental results from Ref. . The computational configuration can be seen in Fig. . In a flow field which is filled with Air, there is a static bubble composed of 26% Air and 74% SF 6 . A shock with Ma = 1.2 would pass through the bubble from left to right. The initial conditions of ambient gas are ρ 0 = 1.29kg/m 3 , T 0 = 293K, p 0 = 101.3kPa. Ignoring the pressure difference between interior gas and ambient gas, the initial parameters of the bubble are ρ bubble = 4.859kg/m 3 , p bubble = 101.3kPa,\nand T 0 = 293K. For simulating, these actual physical quantities should be transferred to dimensionless parameters. This process can refer to the Appendix A. The dimensionless conditions of macroscopic quantities of the fluid field in initial time are (ρ, T, u x , u y ) bubble = (4.0347, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 1 = (1.3416,\n1.128, 0.3616, 0.0), (ρ, T, u x , u y ) 0 = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), where the subscript \"0\" (\"1\") represents downstream (upstream) region. In two-fluid DBM code, the distribution function f Air is used to describe the ambient gas, i.e., Air. The f bubble characters the bubble which is a mixture that composed of Air and SF 6 . The grid number is N x × N y = 800 × 400, where the N x and N y are grid number in x and y direction, respectively. This grid size has passed the mesh convergence test.",
      "The difference between S NOMF and S NOEF increases with decreasing specific-heat ratio. Conclusions\n\nSpecific-heat ratio effects on the interaction between a planar shock wave and a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubble are studied by a two-fluid DBM which has a flexible specific-heat ratio and includes several schemes for analyzing the complex physical fields. Besides the HNE that NS easily describes, the DBM pays more attention to the related TNE that NS is not convenient to describe. First, both the snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales from DBM simulation are compared with those from experiment. The quantitative agreements between them indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities, spatial-temporal steps, and simulation parameters like the relaxation times are suitable for the following physical researches. Then, five cases with various specific-heat ratios are simulated. Several analysis methods for complex physical fields, including the description scheme of TNE behaviors, tracer particle method, and two-fluid model, are used to characterize the effects of specific-heat ratio on the bubble shape, deformation process, average motion, vortex motion, mixing degree of the fluid system, TNE strength, and entropy production. Specifically, for bubble shape, bubbles with different specific-heat ratios display various jet structures. The smaller the specific-heat ratio is, the stouter the jet structure can be seen. For the case with smaller specific-heat ratio, the fluid is easier to be compressed. So, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.",
      "The below results also show that it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the following research problem. Other parameters used for the simulation are: c = 1.0, η Air = η bubble = 10.0,\nI Air = 3, I bubble = 15, ∆x = ∆y = 1.2 × 10 −4 and ∆t = 1 × 10 −6 . The viscosity effect is feeble compared to the shock compression effect, so it does not significantly affect the deformation of the bubble. Therefore, in this part, the relaxation time τ is set sufficiently small. The inflow (outflow) boundary condition is used in the left (right) boundary, and the periodic boundary is adopted in the y direction. The first-order forward difference scheme is used to calculate the temporal derivative, and the second-order nonoscillatory nonfree dissipative scheme is adopted to solve the spatial derivative in Eq. ( ) . Two quantitative comparisons between experimental results and DBM simulations are shown in the following part, including snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales for the bubble. The first is shown in Fig. non-organized momentum flux (NOMF) uously to form a diffracted shock (DS). As TS propagates, it will split into three branches due to the considerable pressure perturbations caused by the gradual decay of the DS strength . Afterward, as shown in the subfigure at about t = 128µs, two high pressure regions (ROH) generate because of the interaction of these branches. Subsequently, at about t = 148µs, the two ROHs meet, causing the shock focusing. On the one hand, at about t = 168µs, the shock focusing causes the generation of downstream-propagating second transmitted shock (STS) and upward-moving rarefaction wave. On the other hand, it will produce high pressure region inside the bubble, which later leads to a jet structure, as shown at about t = 288µs. At about t = 428µs, due to the deposited vorticity, there will produce a pair of counter-rotating vortexes at the pole region of the bubble. The further development of the vortex pair and the effect of viscosity decrease the amplitude of the jet.",
      "Most of the studies describe bubble characteristics and flows morphology from a macroscopic view. The mesoscopic characteristics such as the kinetic effects which help understand the kinetic process, are rarely to be studied. (iii) Further studies of effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI process. The specific-heat ratio is an essential index for studying the compressibility of the gas. Research from Igra et al. has shown that the differences in the specific-heat ratio of bubbles would cause various wave patterns and pressure distribution inside the bubbles during the interaction process . Besides, many works on hydrodynamic instability have also demonstrated the importance of investigating the specific-heat ratio effect . Among these, Chen et al. investigated the specific-heat ratio effects on temperature gradient and the TNE characteristics of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) system . For the above three points, in this work we apply the recently proposed discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) . The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) research has two complementary branches . One aims to work as a kind of new scheme for numerical solving various partial differential equation(s). The other aims to work as a kind of new method for constructing kinetic model to bridge the macro and micro descriptions. The two branches have different goals and consequently have different rules. The current DBM is developed from the second branch of LBM and focusing more on the Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE) behaviors that the macro modeling generally ignore. It breaks through the continuity and near-equilibrium assumptions of traditional fluid modeling, discards the lattice gas image of standard LBM, and adds various methods based on phase space for checking, exhibiting, describing and analyzing the non-equilibrium state and resulting effects. More information extraction technologies and analysis methods for complex field are introduced with time. The numerical simulation includes three parts, as shown in Fig. ."

      "Among those sitting at the table with Bush were Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings, state Sen. Locke Burt and James McDonough, who would become the state’s hard-nosed drug czar. There was an urgent topic on the agenda that night: the explosion of prescription painkillers. For the state’s first family, it may have been personal. Bush had talked publicly about one of his children’s struggle with addiction. By the time the meal ended, all had agreed on the need for establishing a prescription drug monitoring program that would collect information and track prescriptions written for controlled substances, such as oxycodone. Absent a prescription drug monitoring database, there was no way to know whether someone was “doctor shopping,” going from doctor to doctor, getting more and more prescriptions to feed their habit. And there was no way to know whether a doctor was overprescribing, key to pinpointing whether a pill mill was operating, and where. Similar databases had been adopted by more than a dozen states. It was being described as a “silver bullet” to curb overprescribing. Soon enough, $2 million to get the database up and running would be on the table — but it came with a catch. Florida Attorney General Misfires Against Purdue\nIn 2001, OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma was fending off early criticism of its blockbuster painkiller. At issue was whether Purdue’s aggressive marketing campaign had misled doctors and patients alike. Purdue and three top executives later pleaded guilty to federal charges of illegally marketing the drug. Far from being safe and non-addictive, OxyContin carried the same addiction risk as morphine, and was every bit as potent. But that was six years away. In 2001, towns in Maine reported an alarming uptick in crime tied to OxyContin. The first of several congressional hearings was ramping up. Critics and parents who lost children were piling on. Reporters were starting to write stories. In November, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth appeared poised to take on the company.",
      "That year, Rubio favored a bill changing the Miami-Dade County charter, which failed to pass because of a single “no” vote in the Senate. Burt cast the vote. Angered by what he saw as Burt’s betrayal, Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill. “When I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,” Rubio told The Miami Herald. It’s not certain that the full Legislature would have passed the bill had it made it to a floor vote. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders over years who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Most cited privacy concerns. But prescription monitoring databases in Florida and other states free to use Florida’s model would have pinpointed rogue doctors, would-be pill mills and doctor-shoppers across the country, just as all three were beginning to converge. In doing so, it could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem, not the monster it would become. Only weeks after the 2002 bill was killed, Bush suppressed a sob as he discussed his daughter’s arrest for forging a prescription. Court-ordered to drug treatment and then briefly to jail, Noelle Bush survived her pill addiction. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue’s million-dollar obligation to pay for it. Between 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, and late 2011, when the database finally came online, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners’ reports show. “Not getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,” said Burt. “There was heartache for thousands of families beyond measure and it didn’t have to happen.”\nFlorida Officials Were Told Of The Oxy Express\nThe East Kentucky hills and valleys of Greenup County suit Keith Cooper, a long-haired undercover cop-turned-sheriff: “It’s a backwater."

      "Id. at 2098 (majority opinion) (“Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems.”). — would soon solve the problem.44× 44. Id. at 2103–04 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Bellas Hess, the Court reasoned that the dormant commerce clause protects interstate business from being “entangle[d] . . . in a virtual welter of complicated obligations to local jurisdictions.” Nat’l Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep’t of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 759–60 (1967). The dissent replied that the Court “vastly underestimate[d] the skill of contemporary man and his machines.” Id. at 766 (Fortas, J., dissenting). The dispute in Wayfair over whether software is up to the task effectively reprised the old debate from Bellas Hess, only this time couched as part of the stare decisis inquiry’s concern for reliance interests rather than as a matter of dormant commerce clause doctrine. While Wayfair acknowledged that “[c]omplex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce,” 138 S. Ct. at 2099, the Court remarked that “[t]he physical presence rule is a poor proxy” for an inquiry into any actual burdens imposed on interstate commerce, id. at 2093. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that a “heightened form of stare decisis”45× 45. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). applies when “Congress . . . can, if it wishes, override this Court’s decisions with contrary legislation.”46× 46. Id. at 2101 (first citing Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2036 (2014) (tribal sovereign immunity); then citing Kimble v. Marvel Entm’t, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015) (statutory interpretation); and then citing Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2411 (2014) (judicially created doctrine implementing a judicially created cause of action)). In Quill, the Chief Justice noted, the Court had taken to heart that “Congress may be better qualified” and “has the ultimate power to resolve” the question47× 47.",
      "whether or not Congress can or will act. ”5× 5. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97. Emerging from Wayfair is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine. Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress’s practical ability to fix the problem. Ominous, because the Court’s logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause. Wayfair grants only feeble stare decisis to precedents that set a “constitutional default rule,”6× 6. Id. at 2096 (“While . . . Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.”). meaning constitutional decisions that allow for legislative adjustment or override. This new stare decisis analysis makes other precedents setting constitutional default rules more vulnerable — including, perhaps, mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona7× 7. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). and Mapp v. Ohio.8× 8. 367 U.S. 643 (1961). Since its 1967 decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue,9× 9. 386 U.S. 753 (1967). the Court has held that, under the “dormant” or “negative” implication of the Commerce Clause,10× 10. The dormant or negative commerce clause is a judicial derivation from the Commerce Clause “prohibiting States from discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval,” which “strikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.” Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015). states may not compel remote sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes.11× 11. See Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 759–60. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,12× 12. 504 U.S. 298 (1992). the Court refused to overrule the “bright-line, physical-presence requirement” of Bellas Hess, leaning heavily on stare decisis.13× 13. Id. at 317–18. Three Justices joined a concurrence explaining that their decision rested solely “on the basis of stare decisis.”",
      "The rule deprived the states of billions of dollars, since they could not force remote sellers to collect the tax and consumers hardly ever paid it on their own.30× 30. Id. at 2088 (“[C]onsumer compliance rates are notoriously low.”). Quill “serve[d] as a judicially created tax shelter” for remote retailers who do a great deal of business online.31× 31. Id. at 2094. Satisfied that Bellas Hess and Quill were wrongly decided, the Court then jumped the hurdle of stare decisis. The Quill Court had feared upsetting reliance interests.32× 32. Quill, 504 U.S. at 317 (“Bellas Hess . . . has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.”). Wayfair shrugged off this concern, noting that “stare decisis accommodates only ‘legitimate reliance interest[s]’”; by contrast, reliance on the physical presence rule was largely due to consumers evading their use-tax obligations.33× 33. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2098 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824 (1982)). Quill had also appealed to Congress’s ultimate authority over interstate commerce as a reason to abide by a precedent, even if wrongly decided.34× 34. See Quill, 504 U.S. at 318–19; id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (“Congress . . . can change the rule of Bellas Hess by simply saying so.”). But Wayfair denied that Congress’s ability to change the law was a proper consideration:\nWhile it can be conceded that Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule. It is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court’s own creation. Courts have acted as the front line of review in this limited sphere; and hence it is important that their principles be accurate and logical, whether or not Congress can or will act in response.35× 35. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97. Having dispensed with the physical presence rule, the Court remanded the case to the South Dakota courts to determine in the first instance “whether some other principle in the Court’s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act.",
      "See supra p. 278. The Court even insisted that to do so “is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role,” since Quill embodied “a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation. ”57× 57. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096 (emphasis added). This refusal breaks from the practical Brandeisian wisdom that has guided the Court’s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century. The point is not that stare decisis should have ultimately propped up Bellas Hess yet again, as Wayfair’s dissenting Justices maintained. After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch’s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill. In this vein, the Court could have sensibly pointed out that Congress is unlikely to stick its neck out with a tax hike (or a look-alike) from which only the states would benefit.58× 58. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Brian Galle, Essay, Kill Quill, Keep the Dormant Commerce Clause: History’s Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70 Stan. L. Rev. Online 158, 160–62 (2018), https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/70-Stan.-L.-Rev.-Online-158-Galle.pdf [https://perma.cc/22YP-P4V5]; Edward A. Zelinsky, The Political Process Argument for Overruling Quill, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 1177, 1191–92 (2017). Indeed, South Dakota advanced such practical arguments in its brief.59× 59. See Petitioner’s Brief at 54, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress has little incentive to act here because it would be (or appear to be) authorizing new or greater tax collections from its constituents, while receiving none of the revenue in return.”). More generally, the Court might have discussed the limits of the states’ influence in the federal system as a reason not to wait for congressional intervention, a topic it has debated on other occasions.60× 60. See Richard H. Pildes, Institutional Formalism and Realism in Constitutional and Public Law, 2013 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30–32; see also Galle, supra note 58, at 159 (“Congress is not a trustworthy guardian of state fiscal power, making continuing judicial involvement a more appealing prospect.”).",

South Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax. Judicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1× 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405–10 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (“[Justice Brandeis’s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.”). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with “special force. ”2× 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between “constitutional” and “statutory” precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between “constitutional” and “nonconstitutional cases.” See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has — until now — adhered to Justice Brandeis’s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3× 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4× 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421–27 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must “address a false constitutional premise . . . ."

      "I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home. Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with. I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings. I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed.",
      "Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts. On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet. I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass. When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass. I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Shopping for the Partially Built KR. This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly. Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me. After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it.",
      "\"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call. Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project. When we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop. There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars."

      "Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives. In 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis. Early life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961. She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead. She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class. She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964. Legal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time.",
      "\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis. According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\" One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings. In 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk. Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter). She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children. When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.

      "The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies. In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse. Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions. The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures. Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\". In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance. After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted. In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy. U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\" In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them. Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\""

      "Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd. This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites. Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.",
      "Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary. Seating is luxurious for one. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale. The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front. Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location. The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.",
      "They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer. They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.",
      "Shopping for the Partially Built KR. This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly. Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me. After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it.",
      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck.

      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads."

      "The production of an archaeobotanical dataset is very time-consuming, and interim publication on notable aspects of an assemblage may be considered as a necessary publication strategy. More broadly, one important aspect is issues of equity in access to digital archiving resources (Wright & Richards 2018), such as differential access to funds, training and knowledge. A recent study in Sweden found that we need to know concerns, needs, and wishes of archaeologists in order to improve preservation of archaeological data (Huvila 2016), especially when control of ones data may be linked to perceptions of job security. In order to make improvements in data sharing and reuse across archaeology, we need improved training in data sharing and the reuse of data in higher education (Touchon & McCoy 2016; Cook et al. 2018), improved training in data management (Faniel et al. 2018), and crucially, the necessary software skills to make the reuse of archived datasets attainable (Kansa & Kansa 2014: 91). Examples of good practice in archaeobotany are the Vaihingen and Gordion datasets which demonstrate how datasets can be archived in data repositories to accompany a monograph (Bogaard 2011b; Marston 2017b), whilst Farahani (2018) provides an excellent example of a journal article, where the primary data is supplied as a .csv in a cited data repository along with the R script for the analysis. In tandem with the need to encourage authors to share their data, is the need for journals to create and implement research data policies. Given the existence of research data policies in many of the journals included here, this reflects other findings of the poor enforcement of data policies by journals (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018), supporting arguments that journals should not be relied upon to make data accessible, and data should instead by deposited in digital repositries. In order to implement change in data sharing, there is a role to play for learned societies and academic organisation in lobbying funding bodies, prioritising data sharing in research projects.",
      "These however would not be citable as a separate dataset. Supplementary datasets are the third most common form of data sharing. Indeed, the use of electronic supplementary material has been advocated recently for by some journals, such as the Journal of Archaeological Science (Torrence, Martinón-Torres & Rehren 2015). Microsoft Excel spreadsheets are the most common form of supplementary data, followed by .pdfs and then word documents (Figure 1). Both .xlsx and .docx are proprietary file formats, and not recommended for long term archiving or open science principles. There is no indication of improvement over the last decade in the form of data sharing. In 2018, 50% of articles did not share their primary data, and where the data was shared, it was in proprietary forms (.docx, .xlsx) or those that do not easily facilitate data reuse (.pdf) (Figure 3). Chart showing the location of archaeobotanical data from 2009–2018 in primary archaeobotanical data publications. Just one of the articles included in this review incorporated a dataset archived in a repository (Farahani 2018), in contrast to the substantial growth in data repositories across academic disciplines (Marcial & Hemminger 2010). Other examples provide the underlying data for monograph publications, such as that of the archaeobotanical data from Gordion, Turkey (Marston 2017a, 2017b), Silchester, UK (Lodwick 2018; University of Reading 2018) and Vaihingen, Germany (Bogaard 2011a; Bogaard, 2011b). Several of the journals that have been assessed have research data policies. In the case of Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, sufficient papers have been surveyed to assess the impact of the research data policy on the availability of data. Figure 4 show the proportion of data sharing formats through time just for VHA (note the small sample size). The introduction of a research data policy in 2016 encouraging data sharing in repositories has not resulted in any datasets being shared in that format. Of the 10 articles published in PLOS One after the introduction of a clear research data policy in 2014, 4 did not contain primary data."

      "The committee is happy to report that the six electoral districts are in compliance. The committee has developed a petition on election procedures for president-elect and district director. The proposed election mechanism provides for a preferential (ranked) ballot and an \"instant runoff.\" N&E continues to address the areas of campaigning and the timing of our national election process. Between the Chicago and Boston meetings, the committee plans to sponsor online forums for input from councilors and other interested members on these issues. In response to member concerns regarding the collection of signatures for petition candidates, N&E reviewed the society's bylaws. The bylaws state that an endorsement is required, but does not stipulate the method of endorsement. N&E has determined that original or electronic signatures are acceptable and will establish appropriate procedures for receipt of electronic signatures. The Committee on Constitution & Bylaws (C&B), acting for the council, issued new certified bylaws to the Corning Section, the Portland Section, the Division of Colloid & Surface Chemistry, and the Division of Chemical Education. The committee reviewed new proposed amendments for the Division of Medicinal Chemistry, the Columbus Section, the Detroit Section, and the Southern Arizona Section. Three petitions were presented to council for action at this meeting. Regarding the \"Petition on Election Procedures 2006,\" a motion to separate the petition was approved, and the petition was divided. Provisions affecting bylaw V, sec. 2d, bylaw V, sec. 3c, and bylaw V, sec. 4f, which deal with election procedures and the timing of run-off elections, were approved by council and will become effective following confirmation by the board of directors. The second part of the petition regarding bylaw V, sec. 2c, and bylaw V, sec. 3b, which deal with signature requirements for petition candidates for president-elect and director-at-large respectively, was recommitted to the Committee on Nominations & Elections, which has primary substantive responsibility for the petition.",
      "The Committee on Nominations & Elections was asked to reconsider the signature requirements, procedures for acceptance of electronic signatures, and recommendations from the Governance Review Task Force on election procedures. The second petition presented to council for action was the \"Petition on Rules for Nominating Members of N&E for National Offices.\" This petition was not approved by council. The third petition, the \"Petition on Multiyear Dues,\" was amended by incidental motion on the council floor, calling for the petition to become effective when technical components are instituted to track payments, but no later than Jan. 1, 2010. Council approved the incidental motion and then approved the petition. The committee reviewed one petition for consideration, the \"Petition on Local Section Affiliations,\" which will be submitted to council for action at the fall 2007 meeting in Boston. The committee met with representatives of the Committee on Membership Affairs and the Governance Review Task Force to continue discussions on proposals currently being formulated on membership requirements and student membership. In addition, the committee discussed election issues of concern to the Southern California Section. We hope you enjoyed the presidential and division thematic program, \"Sustainability of Energy, Food & Water\" in Chicago. A small, dedicated group of volunteers and staff labored tirelessly to create and coordinate this programming; to them the Committee on Divisional Activities (DAC) offers sincere thanks. DAC has committed to transfer the process of choosing and organizing future national meeting themes to a body that represents all divisions. We made substantial progress in Chicago, where division, secretariat, and committee representatives convened to discuss national meeting program concepts. They proposed themes for the 2008 Philadelphia national meeting as well as a framework for a future national programming group. Divisions have successfully served their members fortunate enough to attend national meetings.",
      "ConC began developing its recommendations for the 2008 committee chair appointments for consideration by the president-elect and chair of the board. ConC continues to focus efforts to identify members with the skills and expertise specified by the committee chairs using the councilor preference form. The form will be sent to councilors in May. ConC also seeks the names of noncouncilor members for consideration for service on council-related committees, especially those with no prior appointment. As part of ongoing activities with the joint CPC-Board Governance Review Task Force, ConC has collected data on committee liaisons to other committees. This information will be distributed to committee chairs. The number of liaisons indicates that unofficial but strong communication channels exist within the ACS committee structure. On Sunday evening, the Committee on Nominations & Elections (N&E) sponsored its fifth successful Town Hall Meeting for President-Elect Nominees. An estimated 200 people attended this session. This forum facilitated communication among the 2008 president-elect nominees, councilors, and other members. N&E will hold another Town Hall Meeting featuring the candidates for director-at-large at the fall meeting in Boston. Now that voting over the Internet has become an accepted procedure for ACS national elections, the ACS technical divisions and local sections have expressed strong interest in using this method for their elections. N&E has developed protocols for elections for local sections and divisions. This document will be forwarded to the appropriate committees for their review and distribution. N&E is responsible for reviewing annually the distribution of member populations within the six electoral districts to ensure that the districts have equitable representation. According to bylaw V, section 4(a), the member population of each electoral district must be within 10% of the result of dividing by six the number of members whose addresses lie within these districts.",
      "The committee received input from the Governance Review Task Force and its action teams, the Council Policy Committee, the board of directors, the Committee on Constitution & Bylaws, and several other committees between the San Francisco and Chicago meetings. These interactions have resulted in the current bylaw change recommendations. In Chicago, representatives from MAC attended several committee meetings and all seven councilor caucuses to summarize the current proposal for membership changes, answer questions, and seek input. In addition, all committee chairs were invited to have their respective committees review these bylaw changes and respond to MAC—if possible—before council met on Wednesday. MAC received 11 responses: eight supported the proposed changes as is, and three supported the proposed language with specified changes or considerations. The comprehensive petition will likely represent the most significant and voluminous change in the ACS bylaws that has occurred in decades, and MAC is proud to be among the leaders in its development and in efforts to get it right the first time. Hundreds of individuals have contributed to this major effort, since MAC began such discussions at the spring 2004 national meeting. The Committee on Ethics met in Chicago and discussed the possibility of organizing and scheduling a committee retreat in the near future to enable the committee to move from the current stage of exploring the needs and interests of ACS members to setting priorities for the next few years. The Project SEED program offers summer research opportunities for high school students from economically disadvantaged families. Since its inception in 1968, the program has had a significant impact on the lives of more than 8,400 students. At the selection meeting in March, the committee approved research projects for 340 SEED I students and 98 SEED II students for this summer in more than 100 institutions. The 2006 annual assessment surveys from 300 students indicate that 78% of the Project SEED participants are planning to major in a chemistry-related science, and 66% aspire to continue to graduate education.",
      "The committee agreed to include the list of significant external awards in the awards locator database that is being developed. The committee was updated on efforts to reconcile ACS's technical divisions' desires to leverage national meeting content using the Internet with our journal editors' concerns about prior publication issues. A conference call on this issue was scheduled for April 21, 2007. The committee received a presentation on the recent actions of the ACS Board of Directors International Strategy Group (ISG). The group's charge is to develop recommendations for a short- and long-term international strategy for the society. The committee was updated on the status of the activities of the Board Oversight Group on Leadership Development (BOG). Potential solutions for the unexpectedly high cost of facilitator training and transitioning from the current Leaders Conference format to the newly designed curriculum were presented to the committee. The committee reviewed plans for conducting the 2007 Membership Satisfaction Survey. Preliminary results are expected in May or June with a final report to be delivered to the board at the 2007 Boston national meeting. The committee received a briefing on the status of the MORE Project: Multidisciplinary Opportunities though Resource Enhancement. Twenty-eight proposals were received, and a decision on which proposals to support will be made in early May. The chair led a discussion on draft 2007 committee goals, and committee members offered several suggestions related to successfully meeting them. One suggestion was to modify a communications goal to make it more completely reflect the duties of the committee outlined in the board regulations. The chair and committee members will examine the suggestion and revisit the question after the board retreat where board committee duties will be examined. ACS President Hunt discussed her 2007-08 Presidential Task Force on Enhancing Science & Technology, which is charged with developing advocacy best practices that can enhance ACS's attainment of its public policy priorities."

      "About the instructor: Born in Yorkshire, England, Andrew Pighills is an accomplished stone artisan, gardener and horticulturist. He received his formal horticulture training with The Royal Horticultural Society and has spent 40+ years creating gardens and building dry stone walls in his native England in and around the spectacular Yorkshire Dales and the English Lake District. Today, Pighills is one of a small, but dedicated group of US-based, certified, professional members of The Dry Stone Walling Association (DSWA) of Great Britain. Having moved to the United States more than 10 years ago, he now continues this venerable craft here in the US, building dry stone walls, stone structures and creating gardens throughout New England and beyond. His particular technique of building walls adheres to the ancient methods of generations of dry stone wallers in his native Yorkshire Dales. Pighills’ commitment to preserving the integrity and endurance of this traditional building art has earned him a devoted list of private and public clients here and abroad including the English National Trust, the English National Parks, and the Duke of Devonshire estates. His stone work has been featured on British and American television, in Charles McCraven’s book The Stone Primer, and Jeffrey Matz’s Midcentury Houses Today, A study of residential modernism in New Canaan Connecticut. He has featured in the N Y Times, on Martha Stewart Living radio, and in the Graham Deneen film short “Dry Stone”, as well as various media outlets both here and in the UK, including an article in the Jan/Feb 2015 issue of Yankee Magazine. Pighills is a DSWA fully qualified dry stone walling instructor. In addition to building in stone and creating gardens, Pighills teaches dry stone wall building workshops in and around New England. He is a frequent lecturer on the art of dry stone walling, and how traditional UK walling styles compare to those found in New England. His blog, Heave and Hoe; A Day in the Life of a Dry Stone Waller and Gardener, provides more information about Pighills.",

      "The restaurant-builder, however, with an eye doubtless to possible American patronage, has assured the world that every effort will be made to preserve as much as possible of the entire structure.[30]\nConcerned with the possible demolition of Franklin’s residence, the Royal Society of Arts (formerly the Society of Arts[31]) initiated an inquiry into the matter.[32] The London County Council, having taken over the responsibility of placing memorial tablets on notable houses from the Royal Society, was charged with the investigation. It ultimately fell to Sir George Laurence Gomme, a clerk to the Council, to come up with a response. A few years earlier Sir George had discovered Margaret Stevenson residing at No. 27 Craven Street in the Westminster Rate Books. He must have wondered why No. 7 on the west side of Craven Street was being celebrated as Franklin’s residence when the evidence clearly showed otherwise. Sir George and his staff examined the various London directories discussed earlier and came up with a novel explanation for the discrepancy. They concluded that there had been two numbering systems on Craven Street. An anonymous author echoes Sir George’s conclusion about the two numbering systems in an article in The Journal of the Royal Society of Arts:\n…an inspection of the directories of that time proves that there were at least two systems of numbering in Craven Street before the erection of the additional houses. According to one of these the numbers started from the top (Strand end) on the west side of the street, and ran down to the bottom to No. 20, then crossed over and went back to the Strand along the east side – 21 to 36. According to the other system, the east side of the street was numbered from the bottom upwards, starting at No 1. This was not apparently in general use, but there is evidence that this numbering was at all events occasionally used. The evidence of these two systems of numbering, and for believing that Mrs. Stevenson’s house was first No. 7 under the oldest system, next No. 27 under the second system, and finally No. 36 under the latest and existing system, is to be found in the various directories and the Westminster rate-books.[33]\nThe “evidence” mentioned above consisted of The London Directory’s listing of Brown & Whiteford at No. 9: “The rate-books for 1781 and 1786 show the house next but one to the north of Mrs. Stevenson’s house as in the occupation of Brown and ‘Whiteford,’ while the old directories mention the business of the firm as wine merchants, and give their address as 9, Craven Street – then a little later, down to 1791, as 29, Craven Street."

      "In order to speed up the convergence of radiative transfer in clouds, a quasi-diffusion method has been developed \\cite{aristova}. In addition, the DSA-multigrid method was developed to solve problems in electron transport more efficiently \\cite{trucksin}. One of the most recent convergence methods developed is Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration (FPSA) \\cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}. FPSA accelerates up to $N$ moments of the angular flux and has shown significant improvement in the convergence rate for the types of problems described above. The method returns a speed-up of several orders of magnitude with respect to wall-clock time when compared to DSA  \\cite{JapanFPSA}. In this paper, we introduce a new acceleration technique, called \\textit{Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration} (NFPA). This  method  returns  a  modified  Fokker-Planck (FP) equation  that  preserves  the  angular moments of the flux given by the transport  equation. This preservation of moments is particularly appealing for applications to multiphysics problems \\cite{multiphysics}, in which the coupling between the transport physics and the other physics can be done through the (lower-order) FP equation. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a numerical method that returns a Fokker-Planck-like equation that is discretely consistent with the linear Boltzmann equation. This paper is organized as follows. \\Cref{sec2} starts with a brief description of FPSA. Then, we derive the NFPA scheme. In \\cref{sec3}, we discuss the discretization schemes used in this work and present numerical results. These are compared against standard acceleration techniques. We conclude with a discussion in \\cref{sec4}. \\section{Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\\label{sec2}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0} In this section we briefly outline the theory behind FPSA, describe NFPA for monoenergetic, steady-state transport problems in slab geometry, and present the numerical methodology behind NFPA. The theory given here can be easily extended to higher-dimensional problems.",
      "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec1}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0} \n\nTransport problems with highly forward-peaked scattering are prevalent in a variety of areas, including astrophysics, medical physics, and plasma physics \\cite{HGK,aristova,multiphysics}. For these problems, solutions of the transport equation converge slowly when using conventional methods such as source iteration (SI) \\cite{adamslarsen} and the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) \\cite{gmres}. Moreover, diffusion-based acceleration techniques like diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) \\cite{alcouffe} and nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA) \\cite{smithetall} are generally inefficient when tackling these problems, as they only accelerate up to the first moment of the angular flux \\cite{JapanFPSA}. In fact, higher-order moments carry important information in problems with highly forward-peaked scattering and can be used to further accelerate convergence \\cite{japanDiss}. This paper focuses on solution methods for the monoenergetic, steady-state transport equation in homogeneous slab geometry. Under these conditions, the transport equation is given by\n\\begin{subequations}\\label[pluraleq]{eq1}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{t1}\n\\mu\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\psi(x,\\mu) + \\sigma_t \\psi(x,\\mu) = \\int_{-1}^{1} d\\mu' \\sigma_s(\\mu,\\mu') \\psi(x,\\mu') + Q(x, \\mu), \\,\\,\\, x\\in [0, X],-1\\leq\\mu\\leq 1  ,\\\\\n\\end{equation}\nwith boundary conditions\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{t2}\n\\psi(0,\\mu) &= \\psi_L(\\mu), \\quad \\mu > 0,\\\\\n\\label{t3}\n\\psi(X,\\mu) &= \\psi_R(\\mu), \\quad \\mu < 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\end{subequations}\nHere, $\\psi(x,\\mu)$ represents the angular flux at position $x$ and direction $\\mu$, $\\sigma_t$ is the macroscopic total cross section, $\\sigma_s(\\mu,\\mu')$ is the differential scattering cross section, and $Q$ is an internal source. New innovations have paved the way to better solve this equation in systems with highly forward-peaked scattering. For instance, work has been done on modified $P_L$ equations and modified scattering cross section moments to accelerate convergence of anisotropic neutron transport problems \\cite{khattab}.",
      "\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec4}\n\nThis paper introduced the Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration technique for steady-state, monoenergetic transport in homogeneous slab geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first nonlinear HOLO method that accelerates \\textit{all $L$ moments} of the angular flux. Upon convergence, the LO and HO models are consistent; in other words, the (lower-order) modified Fokker-Planck equation \\textit{preserves the same angular moments} of the flux obtained with the (higher-order) transport equation. NFPA was tested on a homogeneous medium with an isotropic internal source with vacuum boundaries, and in a homogeneous medium with no internal source and an incoming beam boundary. For both problems, three different scattering kernels were used. The runtime and iterations of NFPA and FPSA were shown to be similar. They both vastly outperformed DSA and GMRES for all cases by orders of magnitude. However, NFPA has the feature of preserving the angular moments of the flux in both the HO and LO equations, which offers the advantage of integrating the LO model into multiphysics models. In the future, we intend to test NFPA capabilities for a variety of multiphysics problems and analyze its performance. To apply NFPA to more realistic problems, it needs to be extended to include time and energy dependence. Additionally, the method needs to be adapted to address geometries with higher-order spatial dimensions. Finally, for the NFPA method to become mathematically ``complete\", a full convergence examination using Fourier analysis must be performed. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper and must be left for future work. \\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nThe authors acknowledge support under award number NRC-HQ-84-15-G-0024 from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

      "In the wings, momentum redistribution owing to cycles of ion-Rydberg charge transfer retards radial expansion \\cite{Pohl2003,PPR}. By redirecting electron energy from ambipolar acceleration to $\\pm x$ plasma motion, NO$^+$ to NO$^*$ charge exchange dissipates electron thermal energy. This redistribution of energy released in the avalanche of the Rydberg gas to plasma, causes the ellipsoidal Rydberg gas to bifurcate \\cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}, forming very long-lived, separating charged-particle distributions. We capture the electron signal from these recoiling volumes on an imaging detector as pictured in Figure \\ref{fig:bifurcation}. Here, momentum matching preserves density and enables ions and Rydberg molecules to relax to positions that minimize potential energy, building spatial correlation. The semi-classical description of avalanche and relaxation outlined above forms an important point of reference from which to interpret our experimental observations. The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution. This initial condition has an evident effect on the evolution dynamics. We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma using a realistic, ellipsoidal representation of the ion/electron and Rydberg densities \\cite{haenelCP}. No combination of initial conditions can produce a simulation that conforms classically with the state of arrested relaxation we observe experimentally. \\subsection{A molecular ultracold plasma state of arrested relaxation} Thus, we find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydberg molecules in the wings of the ellipsoid quenches the ion-Rydberg molecule relative velocity distribution.",
      "To illustrate this, Problem 1 was tested using different Screened Rutherford Kernels with increasing $\\eta$ parameters. The percent errors (relative to the transport solution) for the scalar flux obtained with the LO equation and with the standard FP equation at the center of the slab are shown in \\cref{momcomp}. It can be seen that the percent relative errors in the scalar flux of the FP solution is orders of magnitude larger than the error produced using the LO equation. The same trend can be seen when using the exponential and Henyey-Greenstein kernels. \\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.15,angle=0]{relerrorlog.jpg}\n  \\caption{Log Scale of $\\%$ Relative Error vs $\\eta$ for Problem 1 at the Center of the Slab with SRK}\n  \\label{momcomp}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsubsection{EK: Exponential Kernel}\n\nThe exponential kernel \\cite{pomraning2, JapanFPSA} is a fictitious kernel made for problems that have a valid Fokker-Planck limit \\cite{pomraning1}.

Chaos and violence continue, Nouri's incomplete Cabinet continues to receive criticism, a father offers an 'excuse' for killing his own daughter, and more. Marci Stone (US Headlines Examiner) reports, \"Friday afternoon, Santa is currently in Baghdad, Iraq and on his next stop is Moscow, Russia, according to the 2010 NORAD Santa Tracker. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has been tracking Santa as he makes his annual journey throughout the world.\" Gerald Skoning (Palm Beach Post) quotes Santa saying, \"We send our special wishes for peace and goodwill to all. That includes the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.\" Please note that this is Santa's seventh trip to Iraq since the start of the Iraq War and, as usual, his journey was known in advance. No waiting until he hit the ground to announce he was going to Iraq -- the way George The Bully Boy Bush had to and the way US President Barack Obama still has to. In the lead up to Santa's yearly visit, many 'authorities' in Iraq began insisting that Christmas couldn't be celebrated publicly, that even Santa was banned. Gabriel Gatehouse (BBC News) quotes Shemmi Hanna stating, \"I wasn't hurt but I wish that I had been killed. I wish I had become a martyr for this church, but God kept me alive for my daughters.\" Shemmi Hanna was in Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad when it was assaulted October 31st and she lost her husband, her son, her daughter-in-law and her infant grandson in the attack. The October 31st attack marks the latest wave of violence targeting Iraqi Christians. The violence has led many to flee to northern Iraq (KRG) or to other countries. Zvi Bar'el (Haaretz) notes, \"This week the Iraqi legislature discussed the Christians' situation and passed a resolution in principle to help families who fled.",

Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that \"war is not the answer.\" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, \"How is the war economy working for you?\"While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N. Environmental Sustainability Index on being most livable and greenest benefits. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead. The US military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent. Linda Pershing (Truthout) reports, \"Responding to a call from the leaders of Stop These Wars(1) - a new coalition of Veterans for Peace and other activists - participants came together in a large-scale performance of civil resistance.",
      "AP reports that Iraqi police sought out a 19-year-old woman because of rumors that she was working with al Qaida in Mesopotamia only to be greeted with the news that her father allegedly killed her and the father showed the police where he buried the woman . . . last month. The story begs for more than it offers. The most obvious observation is: what does it say that a woman's allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month? After that, it should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, \"his wife, two sons and a nephew\" -- as well as injuring four more people, and a Samarra roadside bombing which claimed the lives of 2 police officers. DPA notes it was two homes bombed in Haswa and that the Samarra roadside bombing also injured four Iraqi soldiers. Jomana Karadsheh (CNN) reports, \"Another policeman was wounded in Baghdad Friday night when a roadside bomb detonated by a police patrol, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.\"And we'll close with this from Peace Mom Cindy Sheehan's latest Al Jazeera column:The recent repeal of the US military policy of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" is far from being the human rights advancement some are touting it to be. I find it intellectually dishonest, in fact, illogical on any level to associate human rights with any military, let alone one that is currently dehumanising two populations as well as numerous other victims of it's clandestine \"security\" policies. Placing this major contention aside, the enactment of the bill might be an institutional step forward in the fight for \"equality\"; however institutions rarely reflect reality. Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military?While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot - as a peace activist - rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals in one of the least socially responsible organisations that currently exists on earth: The US military.",

      "Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size.

We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0). The denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1. For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work. As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1. The eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise.",
      "Here the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation. The success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate. These propagated errors * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de ≈ C\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue). Because the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit. We first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.",
      "We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.

A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step . We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise. We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t. Depending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.",

Let us rescale that function with the speed of light to make it dimensionless, give it an overall minus sign to make it positive for infalling particles, and call it $\\beta(r)$,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r)\\equiv -\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} T}(r). \\label{betaDefinition}\n\\end{equation}\n\nRecall from section \\ref{SymmetriesCoordinates} that we also still have the freedom to decide on the physical meaning of $r$. We make the choice of making $\\mathrm{d} r$ the physical length measured by one of our infalling observers at the relevant location in spacetime, at constant time $T$. Via our angular coordinates, that implies that length measurements orthogonal to the radial direction, $r\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $r\\cdot\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ inherit the same physical interpretation. As a next step, we transform our metric (\\ref{StaticForm}) from the static form into the form appropriate for our coordinate choice $r$ and $T$. We do so by writing the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value.

      "\\label{StaticForm}\n\\end{equation}\nStudents familiar with  ``reading'' a spacetime metric will immediately recognize the sign difference between the parts describing space and describing time that is characteristic for spacetime, and the speed of light $c$ that gives us the correct physical dimensions. That there is no explicit dependence on $\\varphi$ and $\\vartheta$ in the remaining functions $F$ and $G$ is a direct consequence of spherical symmetry. That the factor in front of $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$ is $r^2$ is a consequence of our coordinate choice, with spherical angular coordinates so that the area of a spherical surface of constant radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. That there is no explicit dependence on ${t}$ is one consequence of the spacetime being static; the absence of the mixed term $\\mathrm{d} {t}\\cdot \\mathrm{d} r$ is another. We are left with two unknown functions $F(r)$ and $G(r)$. In the following, let us call ${t}$ and $r$ the {\\em static coordinates}. Note that, since $G(r)$ is as yet undefined, we have not yet chosen a specific physical meaning for the length measurements associated with our $r$ coordinate. But because of the $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$ part, it is clear that whatever choice we make, the locally orthogonal lengths $r\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $r\\cdot\\sin\\vartheta\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ will have the same physical interpretation as for the length measurement corresponding to $\\mathrm{d} r$.\n\n\\section{Infalling observer coordinates} \\label{Sec:InfallingObservers}\n\nNow that we know what the radial directions are, at each moment of time ${t}$, we follow Visser\\cite{Visser2005} as well as Hamilton and Lisle\\cite{HamiltonLisle2008} in defining a family of radially infalling observers. Observers in that family are in free fall along the radial direction, starting out at rest at infinity: In mapping each observer's radial progression in terms of the static coordinate time ${t}$, we adjust initial conditions, specifically: the choice of initial speed at some fixed time ${t}$, in just the right way that the radial coordinate speed goes to zero for each observer in the same way as $r\\to\\infty.$\n\nIt is true that talking about ``infalling'' observers already reflects our expectation that our solution should describe the spacetime of a spherically symmetric mass.",
      "But in fact, this new formulation paves the way for an even simpler form of the metric. Consider a specific event, which happens at given radius value $r$. In a small region around that event, we will introduce a new coordinate $\\bar{r}$ to parametrize the radial direction. We want this coordinate to be co-moving with our infalling observers at $r$; each such observer then has a position $\\bar{r}=const.$ that does not change over time. Key to our next step is that we {\\em know} the metric for the local length and time measurements made by any one of our free-falling observers. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric is that of special relativity. Locally, namely whenever tidal effects can be neglected, spacetime geometry for any non-rotating observer in free fall is indistinguishable from Minkowski spacetime as described by a local inertial system. Since we have chosen both the time coordinate $T$ and the physical meaning of the radial coordinate $r$ so as to conform with the measurements of the local infalling observer, the transformation between $\\bar{r}$ and $r$ is particularly simple: It has the form of a Galilei transformation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}\\bar{r}= \\mathrm{d} r + \\beta(r)c\\:\\mathrm{d} T.\n\\label{barRshift}\n\\end{equation} In that way, as it should be by definition, radial coordinate differences at constant $T$ are the same in both systems, while for an observer at constant $\\bar{r},$ with $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}=0$, the relation between $\\mathrm{d} r$ and $\\mathrm{d} T$ is consistent with the definition of the function $\\beta(r)$ in (\\ref{betaDefinition}). Are you surprised that this is not a Lorentz transformation, as one might expect from special relativity? Don't be. We are not transforming from one local inertial coordinate system to another. The $T$ is already the time coordinate of the infalling observers, so both coordinate systems have the same definition of simultaneity, and time dilation plays no role in this particular transformation. Also, we have chosen $r$ intervals to correspond to length measurements of the infalling observers, so there is no Lorentz contraction, either.",
      "If we use ${t}$ to slice our spacetime into three-dimensional hyperplanes, each corresponding to ``space at time ${t}$,'' then each of those 3-spaces has the same spatial geometry. A mixed term would indicate that those slices of space would need to be shifted relative to another in order to identify corresponding points. The mixed term's absence indicates that in adapted coordinates, there is no need for such an extra shift. In those coordinates, we can talk about the 3-spaces as just ``space,'' without the need for specifying which of the slices we are referring to. In the case of spherical symmetry, we can introduce spherical coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry: a radial coordinate $r$ and the usual angular coordinates $\\vartheta,\\varphi$, so that the spherical shell at constant $r$ has the total area $4\\pi r^2$. In consequence, the part of our metric involving $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ will have the standard form\n\\begin{equation}\nr^2(\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\varphi^2) \\equiv r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the right-hand side defines $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$, the infinitesimal solid angle corresponding to each particular combination of $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$.\n\nThe radial coordinate slices space into spherical shells, each corresponding to a particular value $r=const.$ The rotations around the origin, which are the symmetry transformations of spherical symmetry, map each of those spherical shells onto itself, and they leave all physical quantities that do not explicitly depend on $\\vartheta$ or $\\varphi$ invariant. In what follows, we will use the basic structures introduced in this way --- the slices of simultaneous ${t}$, the radial directions within each slice, the angular coordinates spanning the symmetry--adapted spherical shells of area $4\\pi r^2$ --- as auxiliary structures for introducing spacetime coordinates. For now, let us write down the shape that our metric has by simple virtue of the spherical symmetry, the requirement that the spacetime be static, and the adapted coordinates, namely\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \\mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \\mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2."

      "We don't have a different agenda. There's no compromise on our part. Our only mission here is to talk face to face with them and say this is reality and this is a grave situation, and you need to do certain things that we suggest that we think will get our administration to respond to your actions. And again, we're not doing any negotiating. They know me, they have seen my efforts. I have not taken anything from their country in the way of financial benefits, and I'm here only because I want to avoid war. I don't want to see American soldiers killed, and I don't want to see more innocence Libyans killed. BLITZER: You wrote an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" this week saying that once you meet face to face with Moammar Gadhafi, you will tell him to step down. Is that still your intention?\nWELDON: Absolutely, Wolf. I wrote the op-ed before the trip was planned. And I wrote it, Wolf, because back in 2004, when I led the first delegation of Americans to sit down with him in the tent in Tripoli, he said to me, \"Congressman, why did it take 30 years for someone from your country to come and sit with me and tell me to my face that you believe that I'm a criminal and a terrorist. And then if you didn't believe me, bomb me? \"\nAnd I said, \"Leader, I can't explain that.\" So I said now it's time for someone to sit in a tent face to face with Colonel Gadhafi and let him know how grave this situation is. And I'm willing to do that. And I think I'm probably the best person because I have met with him three times, and because I sat in that tent in 2004 and listened to him tell me that. So, in effect, that's why I'm here. BLITZER: You wrote also in \"The New York Times\" this -- you wrote, \"Colonel Gadhafi's son, Saif, a powerful businessman, a politician, could play a constructive role as a member of the committee to devise a new government structure or constitution. \"\nYou know, a lot of people, including the opposition, the rebels, as they're called, they think Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is just as much a killer or thug as his father is, and they say they have no interest in dealing with him either.",

In a network TV interview, Christie called the union leaders, quote, \"political thugs.\" He blames them for teacher lay-offs that he says could have been avoided if they had not opposed salary freezes. The New Jersey Education Association is firing back, accusing Christie of name-calling -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Sticks and stones will break many bones.\nSYLVESTER: Sticks and stones may break my bones --\nSYLVESTER: But words never hurt me. A former U.S. Congressman is in Tripoli, Libya right now. His goal -- to talk to Moammar Gadhafi. His message -- we'll talk about that. My interview with Curt Weldon coming up next. Plus, we showed it to you earlier -- a member of Congress telling colleagues to, quote, \"go to hell. \"\nNow she's is joining us live here in THE SITUATION ROOM to explain. HOLMES NORTON: -- of Columbia. It's another thing to drop a bomb on a city. And that's what this --\nBLITZER: Former Congressman Curt Weldon is in a -- Weldon is on a mission to Libya right now to try to meet with the embattled leader, Moammar Gadhafi. But that may be easier said than done. Joining us now from Tripoli, former Republican Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. Congressman, thanks very much for coming in. And joining us now from Tripoli, former Republican Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. CURT WELDON, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: My pleasure, Wolf.\nBLITZER: Let's talk about your meeting with Moammar Gadhafi. I take it it has not yet happened. Do you expect to meet with the Libyan leader? WELDON: Absolutely. The invitation that was sent to me was from his chief of staff, Bashir Salah, who I've met on all three of my official visits here in 2004 and 2005. And the letter specifically says we want you to come over and meet with the leader and our senior leadership.",
      "So one of them was a doctor, one of them was a medic. And we were in the hospital. And there was real anger at NATO, anger at the fact that when they needed those air strikes on the Gadhafi forces, they weren't getting them. And now, for the second time in a week, there's been another strike. Now, of course, we must stress that NATO says that they -- because they don't have enough boots on the ground, they can neither confirm nor deny this was a NATO strike. But certainly, speaking to eyewitnesses in the hospital, it certainly sounded like an air strike. And there are no other planes in the skies of Libya other than NATO planes -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Ben Wedeman in Benghazi for us. The U.S. says Moammar Gadhafi is no longer the legitimate leader of Libya. So why not recognize the rebels? Why one U.S. official says it raises serious concerns. And a former U.S. Congressman in Libya armed with a message for the Libyan dictator. Will he get to meet with him face-to-face? My interview with Curt Weldon, that Republican former Congressman -- that's coming up, as well. BLITZER: Let's get right to Jack. He's got some nuclear concerns on his mind with The Cafferty File -- Jack. JACK CAFFERTY, THE CAFFERTY FILE: Well, they had another little temblor in Japan -- a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Northeastern Japan today, the strongest aftershock since that massive 9.0 quake and tsunami that followed devastated that nation four weeks ago. And this one today was in roughly the same area. One of the big concerns, of course, is possible further damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, which operates the plant -- or what's left of it -- said there were no serious incidents as a result of today's aftershock. So they say. Radioactivity from that plant has poisoned the surrounding land, air and ocean. Millions of people have been exposed. Millions more could be, as radioactivity has been picked up in food and drinking water and detected in faraway places, like California."

      "Cell lines carrying integrated and partially silenced transgenes were also maintained in 600–1000 μg/ml G418. The C2C12 cell line was provided by ATCC. HeLa and HepG2 cells were obtained by Drs. F. Blasi and G. Tonon at San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, respectively, and were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling, using the Cell ID System kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, STR-based multiplex PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 μL/reaction, including 5 μL Cell ID Enzyme Mix 5X, 2.5 μL Cell ID Primer Mix 10X and 3 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 96°C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 90 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec, and 1 cycle at 60°C for 45 sec. The following STR loci were amplified: AMEL, CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D21S11, D5S818, D7S820, TH01, TPOX, vWA. Fragment length analysis of STR-PCR products was performed by Eurofins Genomics, using standard procedures of capillary electrophoresis on the Applied Biosystems 3130 XL sequencing machine, and assessment of the STR profile was performed at the online STR matching analysis service provided at http://www.dsmz.de/fp/cgi-bin/str.html.\nStable cell clones, expressing myc-tagged human OA1 (GPR143) or GFP transcripts, were generated using pcDNA3.1/OA1myc-His or pcDNA3.1/EGFP vectors . Briefly, HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and selected with 800, 1000, and 650 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma), respectively, which was maintained thereafter to avoid loss of plasmid integration. G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for protein expression by epifluorescence and/or immunoblotting. Full DMEM-based medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and media deprived of Met/Cys (both AAs), Met (only), Cys (only), Alanine (Ala), Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys and His were prepared using the Nutrition free DMEM (cat.#09077–05, from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), by adding Glucose, NaHCO3, and either all 20 AAs (for full medium) or 18–19 AAs only (for deprivations of two-one AAs).",
      "Single AAs, Glucose, and NaHCO3 were from Sigma. Further details and amounts utilized are indicated in S1 Table. All media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and G418 as required. HBSS was from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded at 10–30% of confluency; cells to be starved for 48 h were plated 2–3 times more confluent compared to the control. The following day, cells were washed and cultured in the appropriate medium, with or without EAA, for 24–48 h.\nL-Histidinol (HisOH), PP242, Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), SP600125, Cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma; Salubrinal was from Tocris Bioscience; U0126 was from Promega. Drugs were used at the following final concentrations: HisOH at 4–16 mM; PP242 at 1–3 μM; ISRIB at 100 nM; SP600125 at 20 μM in HepG2 cells and 50 μM in HeLa cells; Cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 ug/ml in HepG2 cells and 100 ug/ml in HeLa cells; Salubrinal at 75 μM; U0126 at 50 μM. Vehicle was used as mock control. Treatments with drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit transgene reactivation (ISRIB, SP600125 and U0126) were initiated 1h before the subsequent addition of L-Histidinol (ISRIB) or the subsequent depletion of Met/Cys (SP600125 and U0126). Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Equal amount (1 μg) of RNA from HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using oligo-dT as primers, and diluted to 5 ng/μl. The cDNA (2 μl) was amplified by real-time PCR using SYBR green Master Mix on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche), according to manufacturer’s instructions.

      "Genomic DNA of HeLa and HepG2 cells was purified using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). PCR conditions for amplification of GCN2 exon 1 and 6 were as follows: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 40 sec, 56°C for 40 sec, and 72°C for 40 sec; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. The primer sequences are provided in S2 Table. For OA1, western immunoblotting was carried out as described . For GCN2, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, boiled at 95°C for 5 min and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel; immunoblotting was then performed following standard procedures. Primary Abs were as follows: anti-human OA1, previously developed by our group in rabbits ; anti-GCN2 (Cell Signaling, Cat. #3302). Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel for Mac (version 15.32, Microsoft) for Student’s t-test; or GraphPad Prism (version 5.0d for Mac, GraphPad Software, Inc.) for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-tests. T-test was used when only two means, typically sample versus control, were compared, as specified in the figure legends. One way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons, followed by either a Dunnett’s (to compare every mean to a control mean), or a Tukey’s (to compare every mean with every other mean) post-test, by setting the significance level at 0.05 (95% confidence intervals). Both tests compare the difference between means to the amount of scatter, quantified using information from all the groups. Specifically, Prism computes the Tukey-Kramer test, allowing unequal sample sizes. P values in Figures are generally referred to comparison between a sample and the control (full medium/mock), and are indicated as follows: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. Comparisons not involving the control are similarly indicated, by a horizontal line at the top of the graphs, encompassing the two samples under analysis.",
      "In these cells, L-Histidinol appears also unable to trigger the ISR, as indicated by lack of CHOP upregulation, possibly due to their different sensitivity to the drug. These findings are consistent with previous reports, describing the use of L-Histidinol in HeLa cells in conditions of low His concentration in the culture medium , which would resemble AA starvation in our system and therefore may not be applicable. Thus, even though the amount of the amino alcohol was adapted to exceed 20 to 80 times that of the amino acid, as described , HeLa cells may be resistant or able to compensate. In contrast, in other cell types, L-Histidinol has been utilized in regular DMEM, to mimic the AA response triggered by DMEM lacking His [48, 49]. Consistently, in HepG2-OA1 cells, L-Histidinol is sufficient to elicit extremely high levels of transgene reactivation, and its combination with PP242 results in additive or even synergistic effects, possibly due to an indirect effect of mTOR inhibition on GCN2 activity (Fig 4B) [50, 51]. Similarly, C2C12-GFP cells efficiently reactivate the transgene upon treatment with L-Histidinol, but not PP242 (S5B Fig). However, differently from HepG2-OA1 cells, simultaneous treatment of C2C12-GFP cells with L-Histidinol and PP242 does not lead to synergistic effects. Consistent with stimulation of the ISR, CHOP and to a minor extent ATF4 are upregulated by L-Histidinol in both cell lines, yet their expression levels show only an incomplete correlation with those of the transgene (Fig 4B, S5B Fig, and not shown). The finding that GCN2 activation by L-Histidinol is sufficient to reactivate the transgenes in both HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells pointed to this kinase, and to the downstream ISR, as the pathway possibly involved in the EAA starvation response. Thus, we investigated whether the ISR is sufficient to trigger upregulation of the OA1 transgene in HepG2-OA1 cells by pharmacological means. As CHOP expression does not correspond quantitatively and is not sufficient to induce transgene reactivation, we tested the role of the core upstream event of the ISR, namely the phosphorylation of eIF2α , which can be induced by pharmacological treatments, independent of GCN2 (Fig 5A)."

      "We’ve compared our notes with the feedback you’ve been sending us and are making some balance changes to them. Thanks for your feedback!\nSlightly reduced the frequency and duration of Juggernaut’s “Unstoppable” ability. • He was indeed a bit too...unstoppable. We’ve toned down the frequency this ability triggers, as well as reduced the duration it’s active for when it does trigger. We feel Juggernaut is still a powerful Champion despite these revisions. Take care! Slightly reduced the starting values of Wolverine's “Cellular Regeneration”. • We found that Cellular Regeneration was too strong at lower levels where fewer counters to Regeneration exist. Re-scaled Gamora's “Assassination” to start higher but scale slower. • At lower levels, Special Attacks were used too infrequently, giving this powerful ability little visibility. We’ve adjusted the scaling to better match Special Attack usage at all levels. Increased the frequency that Black Bolt’s “Provocation” triggers. • Due to the varying Critical Hit rates across all Champions, in some cases Provocation would trigger rarely or not at all within a fight. We’ve increased the frequency to ensure you’ll see it every match – but especially so against opponents with high Critical Hit rates. We’ll continue to follow the effect of these new abilities on gameplay. Please keep your feedback coming! Hey everyone! We have been hard at work on improving the game and have prepared a big update inspired in part by your great community feedback. Please keep letting us know what you think! • Fixed many Dash, Medium, Heavy and Special Attacks missing or failing to execute. • Added Alliances and a new Alliance Crystal. • Rocket Raccoon and Unstoppable Colossus join The Contest. • Temporary Boosts to Attack, Health, and XP are now available from the Alliance Crystal. • Rewards for completing and exploring Chapters and Acts. Earn a guaranteed 3-Star hero crystal for each fully explored Act! This is retroactive, just complete any quest to claim them. • A new Fight Menu combines The Arenas, Story Quests and Event Quest menus.",
      "• Payback and Unbreakable now display their maximum potential damage bonus. • Added detailed descriptions for Bleed Immunity and Poison Immunity. • Gamora: We’ve adjusted the scaling of her base Special Attack damage to ensure they scale up more similarly to other heroes. This also makes Gamora more reliant on her high Bleed damage, and improves the chances of opponents able to deal with her high Bleed. Vital Strike and Jade Assassin damage decreased by 10%. Godslayer damage increased by 10%. • Magik: Rewind is a game-changer for Magik that allows her to go up against foes like Gamora and Rewind off big Critical Hits and Bleed damage; however, the frequency of Rewind triggering was too low to be there when she needed it. Increased the likelihood Rewind triggers by +20% at all levels. Rewind now heals over one second instead of instantly. Fixed a bug allowing Magik to break out of an enemy combo using Rewind. It now only removes Status Effects. • Hulk: Given the riskiness of losing Health in certain game modes, Hulk’s anger-management provided too little help too late in the game. We’ve increased the Attack boost to ensure he’s appropriately scary in all game modes – as long as he’s angry! Increased Hulk Rage by +20% Attack at all ability levels. Arc Overload no longer causes Armor Break when it expires. • Vision: Added Poison Immunity to our robot friend. Arena tuning is an ongoing process. The team is continually making adjustments to Arenas to improve the experience. Ultron has infected The Contest! Many new Champions join the battle against Ultron. Quest through the new Ultron’s Assault Event. Wield new power with Summoner Masteries. Grow your Friend’s List with the new Social Hub.\nTeam up with your Alliance in new Events, Arenas, and more! Filter and sort your Stash. Fights have been optimized for performance improvements on all devices. Users can now filter through the items in their Stash. Fixed several issues where Hero Rating would fluctuate. Fixed a bug with Rhino and Juggernaut having 11-20% more Armor than intended.",
      "This “all or nothing version” feels more like Norman Osborn, pushing his suit to the limit to get a larger boost but at the cost of damaging the suit. The addition of Power Gain allows Iron Patriot a large attack before the suit burns out, if timed correctly. Heavy Attacks: 90% chance to Stagger the enemy for 8 seconds. A Staggered enemy cannot gain their next beneficial effect. All versions of Juggernaut, even those who haven’t been awakened, now gain the 2 second Unstoppable ability at the start of the fight when they hit Rank 2. We wanted to add some new functionality to Juggernaut, while also keeping him true to his Mystic class assignment. To accomplish this, we added this “buff smasher” effect which keeps an opponent from gaining their next beneficial effect. Additionally, we wanted to make non-awakened versions of Juggernaut more fun to play, without adding more power to the awakened variations. As a result, we gave all versions of Juggernaut the ability to become Unstoppable at the start of the fight. While many players liked the new functionality of Star-Lord’s Element Gun effect, they found it to be a little too random, specifically when it would Heal Block a champion incapable of Healing. We’ve now added in some contingencies that will make Heal Block appear less unless the opposing champion shows that he / she can Heal during the fight. This includes both activated healing effects, such as Wolverine or Ultron’s Heal, or passive healing effects gained from Masteries, such as Salve or Willpower. It’s been a bit weird that Bucky wasn’t friends with his most famous friend. Well, he is now. This affects 3 Star and above versions. We’ve increased the overall speed of this attack, allowing quick players to use this ability after a four or five hit combo. It seems the Marvel’s have gotten tired of their beams being dodged so easily and have decided to angle it a little better, increasing the overall range of the attack and making it harder to dodge away from. We’ve also increased the speed of both special attacks to allow them to better flow into combat.",

Fixed an issue where 90s Cyclops’ Armor Breaks would not remove Armor Ups. Fixed an issue with Scarlet Witch’s Signature Ability proc rate (previously, the % chance displayed did not match in-game functionality; this is now fixed).

      "• Each Hero has 1 Stamina and takes 2 hours to recharge. We have removed the Next Quest button for a much more favorable and flavorful approach to teaching and informing people about Marvel : Contest of Champions.

This can be anything from opening Crystals, Continuing a Quest, Ranking Up Champions if the difficulty is too hard, Tips where to obtain items, and Playing Versus/Arenas. • Adjusted the PI calculation for Power Burn and Power Drain abilities to improve accuracy. • Significantly increased the Power Burn multiplier as well as the amount of Power burned. Prior to this change, Vision's Special Attack damage output was far below the curve. Vision's Special Damage is distinct from other heroes in that the dependency on opponents' Power levels cause the damage dealt to be highly variable, and sometimes quite low; however, when striking an opponent with high Power levels, Vision has the potential to deal very high amounts of direct, Armor-ignoring damage. • Slightly adjusted the Armor Break trigger to be less punishing to opponents with the Armor Up ability without sacrificing PI or damage output.\n• Slightly increased his base Health and, in turn, the amount of Health recovered by Regeneration. This improvement is reflected by an increase to PI of about 1%. • Slightly reduced the damage from Bleeding, but slightly increased the amount of Power drained by E.M.P. Arrow to compensate. This added utility strengthens the choice between whether to offensively Bleed the enemy or defensively drain their Power. These changes may modify PI by +/-1%.\n• Slightly reduced the frequency of Nullify for basic attacks, but slightly increased the chance a Special Attack is critical. Chaotic Bombardment no longer has a chance to critical, and instead has a 100% chance to Nullify the target. This is less punishing to opponents with beneficial effects, while providing a more reliable source of Nullify."

      "In other words, the observations the human provides can be defined conditioned only on the robot location, the goal, and the human's preference for its current vertex p v . By introducing this assumption, each update step only requires updating the joint (p v , g), reducing the number of cost computations to |N (v)| × m g . We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of θ are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is\n, it is unlikely that the human will also prefer p v2 = (v 2 , v 1 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity of the inference problem. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to different homotopy classes will cross different sequences of polytopes, i.e. they correspond to a different sequence of edges on G.\nThis can be proved by contradiction. Let us suppose that two continuous trajectories ξ 1 and ξ 2 , with the same start and end points and that do not intersect any obstacle, traverse the same regions in G in the same order. From the construction of the hyperplane arrangement, each polytope that the paths traverse through is obstacle-free. Therefore, within each polytope, there is no obstacle in the area located in between the portions of ξ 1 and ξ 2 that belong to the region. A smooth transformation of ξ 1 into ξ 2 can be obtained by transforming each portion of ξ 1 belonging to the polytopes it intersects into the corresponding portion of ξ 2 for the same polytopes, where the extremities of the trajectory portions are connected to one another along the polytope's edges (where the same edge is crossed by both paths). Along this transformation, the paths do not intersect any obstacle, and therefore ξ 1 and ξ 2 belong to the same homotopy class.",
      "We further assume that having chosen a goal and path preference, the human takes actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,θ that measures the cost of moving from the robot's current location to the goal along the preferred path. For example, C g,θ (s t , o t ) can be the length of the shortest path from location s t to the goal g after taking a first step to o t , and constrained by path preference θ. We use C g,θ to induce a probability distribution over observations, given by: where γ h is a hyperparameter that designates the rationality coefficient. This model assumes the human will pick the lowest cost action with the highest probability and the likelihood of an action decreases exponentially with the increase in cost . Our inclusion of the path preference θ sets our approach apart from . The model is shown in fig. represented as a Bayesian Network. Inference\n\nAt each time step where the human provides an observation, the posterior P (g, θ) is given through the Bayesian update We note that the number of Bayesian updates required at each iteration to update the belief is equal to the cardinality of Ω g × Θ. In addition, each Bayesian update involves computing C g,θ ( .\n, . ) in eq. ( ), which involves solving an optimization problem (such as a shortest path problem). In section IV, we propose a specific encoding of preference θ for resolving eq. ( ), while ensuring the number of computations of the cost C g,θ (., .) per update does not grow exponentially with the number of obstacles. Decision Making\n\nWe consider a navigation problem where the robot receives reward according to the model R(s t , g, θ, a t ). We wish to find the optimal policy π that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards, with discount factor γ. The above problem is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) . In this section, we propose an encoding of human's path preference θ for computing the posterior in eq. ( ). Devifrom the concept of homotopy classes, we define the preference according to a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, as shown in fig. , creating a hyperplane arrangement of the space.",
      "Our solution is to encode path preference based on a partitioning of the environment into polytopes . This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions between adjacent polytopes. Paths belonging to different homotopy classes correspond to different sequences of transitions. By leveraging conditional independence assumptions, we can make the Bayesian inference problem tractable. These assumptions exploit the fact that human actions provide information about the path in a piece-wise manner. For example, indicating a preference for navigating around a particular obstacle only provides information about the local area and not the entire path. Finally, after updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our contributions are as follows. • We formulate the human-robot collaboration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where both the goal of the task and the human's path preference are unknown random variables. • We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, along with conditional independence assumptions that make the Bayesian inference problem tractable to infer the task goal and path preference online. • Through simulations in two environments of different sizes and complexity, we show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human's indications. Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance, and with minimal human input. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in shared autonomy and interactive systems, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks.",
      "Specifically, we model the human's preference over different homotopy classes and leverage a conditional independence assumption to provide a tractable solution. In our approach, we assume that the human's inputs are noisily rational conditioned on both the goal and the preference. By jointly inferring the goal and path preference, we can avoid over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences, leading to improved system performance. We consider the problem of robot navigation in a known environment to an unknown destination, where a human can intervene and provide a heading direction to the robot using a joystick or force cues. The human also has a preference on which path the robot should take with respect to obstacles, and our objective is for the robot to understand the human's intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions. Let g be a discrete random variable denoting the goal of the task, belonging to a set of candidates Ω g , and let θ be a discrete-valued random variable representing the human's path preference, belonging to a set of possible preferences Θ. The physical location of the robot at time index t is denoted by s t ∈ R 2 , and the robot's action at time index t, belonging to some action space A, is denoted by a t . The transition model T (s t+1 | s t , a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that can be mapped to a future location in space. More specifically, we map the direction to an intended location, which is the resulting robot location after advancing in the indicated direction for one time step. For simplicity, we consider that the robot directly makes an observation o t of the location indicated by the human. We assume that the robot has a stochastic observation model for the human P (o t | s t , g, θ) that is conditioned on both the goal of the task g and the human's preferred path θ.",
      "This problem is particularly challenging when both the goal and path preference are unknown a priori. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for encoding and inferring path preference online using a partitioning of the space into polytopes. Our approach enables joint inference over the goal and path preference using a stochastic observation model for the human. We evaluate our method on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions, and find that it outperforms baseline approaches as the human's inputs become increasingly sparse. We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications. INTRODUCTION\n\nCollaboration between humans and robots has become increasingly important and one key aspect of this collaboration is the ability for robots to adapt to human decisions. In many scenarios, such as a robot navigating through a busy room to deliver an item, it is important for the robot to take into account human preferences. For instance, humans may prefer a specific path that would allow their colleagues to notice the item being delivered, but this preference may change dynamically based on various factors such as changes in the environment or unforeseen circumstances. While some preferences can be incorporated into the path-planning process, accommodating dynamic user preferences in real-time remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a way to enable robots to adapt to human preferences dynamically by leveraging real-time feedback to inform decision-making. In this work, we tackle the problem of robot navigation in which the robot cannot observe the goal or the preferred path to the goal, but must make navigation decisions that are influenced by humans through recommended actions. Prior work has explored how to adapt to a human's preference through feedback, but such approaches often require a high level of intervention, which can be time-consuming and impractical in real-world scenarios."

      "The values of these parameters can be tuned to yield an aggressive or defensive behavior of the algorithm. 1) Travel Time: The left plot in Fig. depicts the travel time as a function of longitudinal displacement for the four algorithms. As seen in the plot, our method (SLAS) maintains a lower overall travel time as compared to the other methods. Quantitatively speaking, SLAS outperforms EA , MOBIL and No-change methods by 12.72%, 23.52% and 54.34% respectively in terms of the time required to complete the simulation scenario. This shows that our method's foresight compensates for its apparent conservativeness arising from the need to preserve passenger comfort. 2) Lateral Displacement: To identify the differences in lane changing behaviors between the four approaches, the relationship between lateral and longitudinal displacements over the course of the simulation is highlighted in the center plot of Fig. . In the plot, the lateral displacement of 0 corresponds to the center of lane 0 while the center of each following lane is 3.5m away. Comparing the performance of the four algorithms, we see SLAS and EA showing relatively similar performances, resulting from proactive decision making. In contrast, since MOBIL only assesses the advantage of switching to the adjacent lanes, it is unable to see the benefit of proactively switching to lane 2. This explains why EA and SLAS start outperforming MOBIL in terms of travel time (left plot) at around the 130 [m] mark for longitudinal displacement. As for a direct comparison between SLAS and EA , the benefits of having speed advisory system become apparent in this center plot. Due to speed control, SLAS is able to constantly maintain a greater headway (right plot) without having to brake significantly upon getting too close to the lead vehicle. This results in a smooth lateral displacement profile which allows the vehicle to change lanes with minimal jerk (quantitative analysis to follow in Section IV-C) and deliver better overall timing performance (left plot).",
      "3) Headway: The right plot in Fig. shows the headway maintained by the ego vehicle over the course of the simulation. In accordance with our prior discussion, MOBIL cruises behind the front vehicle, maintaining a relatively low headway until a sufficient space in the adjacent lane is found to perform the lane-change maneuver. On the other hand, EA and SLAS show a comparable headway trajectory, however, SLAS maintains a greater headway throughout and achieves the maximum headway prior to EA . Quantitatively, SLAS maintains on average 9.43%, 36.57% and 113.17% more headway than the EA , MOBIL and No-change approaches respectively. This strong performance by SLAS can be attributed to its incorporation of safety guarantees coupled with its consideration for passenger comfort. 4) Distance to closest vehicle: Finally, we compare the distance that ego vehicle maintains from the closest vehicle throughout the simulation. On average, SLAS maintains 9.28%, 32.01%, and 22.84% more distance in comparison to EA , MOBIL and No-change approaches respectively. These numbers are a testament to the strength of our approach resulting from consideration of long planning horizon coupled with speed control. Monte Carlo Simulations\n\nTo demonstrate the long-term performance of the three approaches (SLAS, EA and MOBIL), we run a series of Monte Carlo simulations on scenarios with randomized initial positions (within a range of 8m) and velocities (within    ranges of 8, 5 and 2 m/s assigned to each of the three lanes randomly) of traffic participants. The result from 50 simulations is presented in Table . In this table, the columns represent the different evaluation metrics, the rows identify the three algorithms, and the values highlighted in green represent the best result with respect to each evaluation metric. The evaluation metrics, going from left to right in the table, are completion time (s), brake (R [−1,0] ), brake jerk (R [−1,0] ), throttle (R [0,1] ), throttle jerk (R [0,1] ), angular acceleration ( • /s 2 ) and angular jerk ( • /s 3 ).",
      "We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in contrast to the existing methods, when applied in conjunction with state-of-the-art trajectory generation and trajectory following frameworks, in a CARLA simulation environment. INTRODUCTION\n\nLane changing is considered to be one of the most risky driving behaviors since it is highly contingent upon multimodal trajectory predictions of neighboring vehicles and requires timely decision making . It is further influenced by a number of uncertainty factors such as road conditions, measurement accuracy, and a long tail of behavioral uncertainty of on-road agents. However, if executed efficiently, lane changing coupled with speed adjustment can yield significant improvement in minimizing overall travel time while ensuring passenger comfort . To elaborate further, consider the scenario presented in Fig. . Based on the predicted motion (shown in a lighter shade) of the neighboring vehicles (shown in orange), the ego vehicle (shown in blue) may decide to either change lane left in an attempt to minimize its travel time or slow down in the current lane to maintain safety. However, it would be imprudent for the ego vehicle to risk changing lane right and consequently get stuck behind a slow moving vehicle even though there is presently a greater headway. This simple scenario highlights the importance of foresight and long planning-horizon in strategic decision making for autonomous vehicles. Existing methods like MOBIL give us the ability to change lanes but behave greedily (prioritizing immediate rewards) oftentimes, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. It was shown in that the lane changing performance can be improved with an A inspired approach, but the formulation was limited to constant speed. Such an approach is unable to assess the benefits of speed adjustment 1 University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. Email: {mftariq,baras}@umd.edu. 2 Honda Research Institute, San Jose, CA, USA.

      "In terms of the learning-based methods, the preferred approach seems to be the variations of Reinforcement Learning techniques applied in a simulated environment , , , , . These approaches, although seeming to work well in simulation, have concerns regarding real-world implementation due to the large amount of training data that they require, the exploration of unsafe behaviors during training, and a general inability to handle edge cases. They mainly utilize neural networks as function approximators which yields low computational complexity but also results in a lack of explainability and safety guarantees. Lastly, the optimization-based approaches, especially the derivatives of optimal control methods, are abundant in the literature. In contrast to the potential-field based approaches that yield decent collision avoidance performance but are unable to accommodate vehicle dynamics, the optimal control methods , especially the derivatives of Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach , , , yield excellent collision avoidance performance while accommodating vehicle dynamics. However, this performance comes at a cost of high computational complexity, arising mainly from the non-convex collision avoidance and the non-linear dynamics constraints. This, in turn, restricts the planning horizon to merely a few seconds. The key requirements for the algorithmic design of an autonomous vehicle include real-time operation, safety guarantees, optimality with respect to some metric(s), and accounting for the behavior variability of on-road agents. Considering these requirements, we propose an optimization-based behavioral planning framework that enables autonomous vehicle maneuvering on multilane highways. While having the benefits of optimizationbased approaches, our method achieves a low computational complexity by employing a binary representation of the decoupled lane indicator dynamics in lieu of lateral dynamics, and utilizing algorithmic modifications to aid numerical computations. Specifically, our method provides: • optimality with respect to travel time and comfort; • safety and feasibility guarantees; • real-time applicability for a long planning horizon; and • modularity in design, which enables the integration of external trajectory prediction modules."

      "In other words, as the robot continually moves in space, the first hyperplane that it will cross upon exiting the polytope will correspond to one of the polytope's nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager outline an iterative method for removing redundant constraints by solving n linear programs. We use this method in practice for computing α j e for each polytope. We can now characterize each polytope by a vector α j e ∈ {−1, 1} n j e , where n j e ≤ n is the number of essential constraints of the polytope. The polytopes P j partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement. Path Preference\n\nIn this section, we provide a definition of preference θ according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition. Let G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector α j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane). Let N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m θ = v∈V |N (v)| be the cardinality of Θ, and m g = |Ω g | the number of possible goals. A priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m θ × m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent.",
      "Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints. However, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging. Prior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences. To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph. Each time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief. On the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal.",
      "Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space. Hyperplane Arrangement\n\nWe assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i ∈ R di×2 and b i ∈ R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.\n.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where α j i ∈ {−1, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i . Fig. : Intent inference model in a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle free space. We spatially decompose the preference θ into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j). We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and α j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and α j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope."

He completed his mission successfully. (I don't think it was without some struggle, stress and depression, but he was able to pick himself up and move on from those times). When he came home he started working for the employment agency again but began looking for employment elsewhere. He got a job at a local Chick Fil-A where he has worked for 3 years. He started college again shortly after he came home but as before it was short lived. He did finish out the semester but failed most of the classes due to his skipping class and not turning in assignments. When he skipped class he would usually sleep in his car. Taylor's life consists of working (where to the best of our knowledge) he does well, he is reliable and his employer likes him. When he comes home from work he either sleeps or plays video games or other games - such as kakuro. He spendes most of his time in the basement where his bedroom is and this is where he games. Taylor owns his own car, bought his own laptop and very rarely spends money. He pays us $200 /month to still live at home, unloads the dishwasher on a regular basis and does the weekly garbage. However, his room is a mess and he only cleans his bathroom when I tell him he needs to clean it. Taylor used to read quite a bit and loved to learn. It has just been in his adult years that he has not read as much - I think because of his gaming addiction. Taylor goes to church on a regular basis but sleeps through the main meeting. In Sunday class room settings he stays awake - I think because he is able to particpate in discussions. Taylor has only had 2 real friends since entering Junior High school.",

      "The proposed method fills in the research gap by meeting all the key algorithmic requirements while simultaneously gaining the foresight to make strategic decisions that yield long-term performance benefits, as verified in Section IV. In this section, we present the algorithmic pipeline and formalize the road, observation and vehicle dynamics models that will be utilized in the subsequent sections. Algorithmic Pipeline\n\nFig. illustrates the algorithmic pipeline of the proposed navigation architecture, in reference to the various existing . Algorithmic pipeline of the proposed navigation architecture. The raw sensory input data is processed by the Perception, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) modules to place the autonomous vehicle relative to the various environmental entities in a unified frame of reference. This information is then passed on to the navigation stack, composed of the behavioral planning, motion planning, and vehicle control modules. The output of the navigation module is passed down further in terms of actuation commands (brake, throttle and steering) to the actuators. algorithmic modules deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The taxonomy of the various components of the navigation stack (highlighted by the dotted rectangle) is borrowed from . This pipeline essentially improves the pipeline introduced in by adding a speed advisory system. Our main focus is the development of the behavior planning module, highlighted as SLAS in Fig. . SLAS outputs the target lane and reference speed which are utilized by the motion planning module to generate a reference trajectory for the ego vehicle. The vehicle controllers compute the throttle and steering commands to track the trajectory accordingly. For the motion planning module, we adopt the Neural Networks integrated Model Predictive Control (NNMPC) due to its ability to accommodate the behaviors of neighboring vehicles in the trajectory generation process. In our approach, we assume that the perception (of other vehicles) and the localization (of ego vehicle) are known without any uncertainty, for simplicity, but the modular architecture avails us the ability to integrate any perception or SLAM module in the overall framework.",
      "In terms of the learning-based methods, the preferred approach seems to be the variations of Reinforcement Learning techniques applied in a simulated environment , , , , . These approaches, although seeming to work well in simulation, have concerns regarding real-world implementation due to the large amount of training data that they require, the exploration of unsafe behaviors during training, and a general inability to handle edge cases. They mainly utilize neural networks as function approximators which yields low computational complexity but also results in a lack of explainability and safety guarantees. Lastly, the optimization-based approaches, especially the derivatives of optimal control methods, are abundant in the literature. In contrast to the potential-field based approaches that yield decent collision avoidance performance but are unable to accommodate vehicle dynamics, the optimal control methods , especially the derivatives of Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach , , , yield excellent collision avoidance performance while accommodating vehicle dynamics. However, this performance comes at a cost of high computational complexity, arising mainly from the non-convex collision avoidance and the non-linear dynamics constraints. This, in turn, restricts the planning horizon to merely a few seconds. The key requirements for the algorithmic design of an autonomous vehicle include real-time operation, safety guarantees, optimality with respect to some metric(s), and accounting for the behavior variability of on-road agents. Considering these requirements, we propose an optimization-based behavioral planning framework that enables autonomous vehicle maneuvering on multilane highways. While having the benefits of optimizationbased approaches, our method achieves a low computational complexity by employing a binary representation of the decoupled lane indicator dynamics in lieu of lateral dynamics, and utilizing algorithmic modifications to aid numerical computations. Specifically, our method provides: • optimality with respect to travel time and comfort; • safety and feasibility guarantees; • real-time applicability for a long planning horizon; and • modularity in design, which enables the integration of external trajectory prediction modules.",
      "The state (x 0 (k)) and control input (u 0 (k)) to the system at time instant k are defined as: where V m denotes the maximum speed of the ego vehicle. Observation Model\n\nFor practical considerations, we restrict the ego vehicle's visibility range to the sensory perception limit, denoted by R v . Then, the set of vehicles in ego vehicle's visibility range at time instant k, represented by O(k), is defined as: where s i (k) corresponds to the longitudinal displacement of the observed vehicle. Remark 1: For the multi-lane highway driving scenario, occlusion does not play a prominent role so we do not account for it in the existing formulation. However, the proposed framework can easily accommodate occlusion and measurement uncertainties since the receding horizon approach bases its decision on the most up-to-date information available at any given time, as demonstrated in . In this section, we describe the prediction model to generate the predicted future trajectories of observed vehicles and present a discussion on the proposed receding horizon optimization-based behavioral planning module. Trajectory Prediction\n\nReliable behavior and trajectory prediction of other traffic participants is crucial for safe maneuvering of autonomous vehicles. The algorithm proposed in Section III-B is able to incorporate any generic prediction module available in the literature as long as it can provide a deterministic predicted future trajectory for a given vehicle. In this work, we formulate a low-complexity prediction model that highlights the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed approach. For an observed vehicle i ∈ O(k), the future speed profile is predicted using a piece-wise linear function while the lane profile is assumed to stay constant for the duration of the prediction horizon. At a given time step k, the estimated acceleration (ā k i ) and the estimated speed (v k i ) parameters are obtained through linear regression with mean-squared error on the past o k i > 1 speed observations.",
      "As will become apparent in Section IV, it may be necessary at times to sacrifice on shortterm benefits to gain long-term performance improvements. In such a scenario, an approach with speed adjustment coupled with long planning horizon has the foresight to deliver significantly better results. Moreover, the inclusion of speed adjustment in the decision making process inhibits the risk of incurring trajectory infeasibility as the environment conditions may prevent the ego vehicle from traveling at a constant reference speed and the low-level planner may be unable to handle such a discrepancy. Therefore, in this work, we propose a low complexity receding horizon optimization based approach that outputs the lane change maneuvers coupled with speed adjustments for long planning horizons (> 15s) while guaranteeing safety. The long horizon strategic decision making gives ego vehicle the ability to proactively anticipate and handle challenging driving situations. Literature review: In the literature, speed and lane changing decisions are generally considered from a motion planner's perspective , which allows for a simultaneous determination of target lanes and waypoints to perform the maneuver. The motion planning methods present in the literature can broadly be categorized into sampling-based, learning-based and optimization-based approaches. In regards to the sampling-based approaches, single-query methods, in particular the different variants of RRT, are preferred over multi-query methods, like roadmap-based methods, due to the faster execution time and their ability to incorporate non-holonomic constraints . Even though these methods are able to incorporate safety guarantees by sampling feasible trajectories from a reachable safe set , the overall driving experience is often rather uncomfortable due to the concatenation of individual trajectories. Moreover, the asymptotic optimality guarantees availed by arXiv:2303.00861v1 [cs.RO] 1 Mar 2023 these methods do not help with real-world implementation in complex driving scenarios since they tend to have high sample complexity ."

Petralia, Ya-Xian Wang, Bechara Kachar. Institutions: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. FRAP has been used to quantify the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins. Using a strong excitation laser, the fluorescence of a GFP-tagged protein is bleached in the region of interest. The fluorescence of the region recovers when the unbleached GFP-tagged protein from outside of the region diffuses into the region of interest. The mobility of the protein is then analyzed by measuring the fluorescence recovery rate. This technique could be used to characterize protein mobility and turnover rate. This FRAP protocol shows how to perform a basic FRAP experiment as well as how to analyze the data.

These cultures can be used for a variety of applications including immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, electrophysiology, calcium and sodium imaging, protein and/or RNA isolation. These cultures also provide a platform to study the neuronal development of transgenic animals that carry a late embryonic or postnatal lethal gene mutation. The procedure is relatively straight forward, requires some experience in tissue culture technique and should not take longer than two to three hours if you are properly prepared. Careful separation of the cortical rind from the thalamo-cortical fiber tract will reduce the number of unwanted non-neuronal cells. To increase yields of neuronal cells triturate the pieces of the cortical tissue gently after the enzyme incubation step. This is imperative as it prevents unnecessary injury to cells and premature neuronal cell death.",

Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

Institutions: VECT-HORUS SAS, CNRS, NICN UMR 7259.The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. Our aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. Astrocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection following trypsin digestion and were frozen for later co-culture. RBEC were isolated from 5-week-old rat cortices. The brains were cleaned of meninges and white matter, and mechanically dissociated following enzymatic digestion. Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders.

Afshari, Jessica C. Kwok, James W. Fawcett. Institutions: University of Cambridge. Schwann cells are one of the commonly used cells in repair strategies following spinal cord injuries. Schwann cells are capable of supporting axonal regeneration and sprouting by secreting growth factors 1,2 and providing growth promoting adhesion molecules 3 and extracellular matrix molecules 4. In addition they myelinate the demyelinated axons at the site of injury 5. However following transplantation, Schwann cells do not migrate from the site of implant and do not intermingle with the host astrocytes 6,7. This results in formation of a sharp boundary between the Schwann cells and astrocytes, creating an obstacle for growing axons trying to exit the graft back into the host tissue proximally and distally. Astrocytes in contact with Schwann cells also undergo hypertrophy and up-regulate the inhibitory molecules 8-13. In vitro assays have been used to model Schwann cell-astrocyte interactions and have been important in understanding the mechanism underlying the cellular behaviour. These in vitro assays include boundary assay, where a co-culture is made using two different cells with each cell type occupying different territories with only a small gap separating the two cell fronts. As the cells divide and migrate, the two cellular fronts get closer to each other and finally collide. This allows the behaviour of the two cellular populations to be analyzed at the boundary. Another variation of the same technique is to mix the two cellular populations in culture and over time the two cell types segregate with Schwann cells clumped together as islands in between astrocytes together creating multiple Schwann-astrocyte boundaries."

      "At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day. Post-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets. Political and social views\n\nEnglish is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law. In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\". In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.",
      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999–2008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

      "It started with typing and labeling, not only sticky labels, but microfiche jackets. They have a little quarter inch tall label strip across the top that chips and peels if you aren’t careful loading them into the typewriter, and strips or frames of 35 and 16 mm film that falls out in your typewriter. Then there were the three-part work orders, with carbon paper, and the three-part shipping labels, also with carbon paper. There were the mistakes – whole orders that had been indexed incorrectly, and therefore typed incorrectly, and therefore had to be corrected and typed all over again. I won’t describe what I had to go through to correct microfiche labels, it was too stupid. I hated doing that, so I asked for my own little “eye-loup” – a little magnifier that you hold up to a light to look at the tiny little page numbers on the film – to make sure the cards had been indexed correctly before I typed them. I’m not perfect, but I know I’m competent, cause I kept that job for five years while I watched others get fired, for everything from showing up late to breaking expensive equipment to stealing. I was given new jobs and increased responsibility as time went by. I got good job reviews from my supervisors, and good raises. Morale was high, we liked our co-workers and our managers, we felt like a team. Our customers were nice to us too. We worked for cities and counties, hospitals, banks – anybody who needed to keep records. We were trusted to handle confidential records, like people’s medical records. As we handled these confidential files we were simply told, “Don’t look at them,” so we didn’t. I left in 1984 in finish school. Over the next decade computers killed the microfilm industry, and the company went out of business. Excuse me if I compare my experiences in the private sector with stuff I’ve seen coming out of our city $taff. I keep waiting for some professional behavior, some professional accountability out of the people who run our town, and I start to wonder if I will ever get it.",
      "I would compare it to the story of the miller’s daughter. On the first day, I was told that the employee I was to be replacing would stick around for a week to train me. At noon that day, having shown me where everything was and how to use the coffee maker, she got up from her chair, smiled, and told me she thought I could “handle it,” then left. At one o’clock, the plant manager came over to my desk followed by several “production” workers. They brought cart loads of microfilm, on rolls, in little white boxes. I was to label all of those boxes, three carts, piled high. This job had gotten held up, he explained, it would be “great!” if it could go out today. Did I think I could get them done by 4 o’clock? I wanted to make everybody happy, so said I yes without thinking, and set to work loading the labels into the typewriter. It was a disaster. I had never typed anything like those labels before – typing class had been all about letters and envelopes, columns and reports. The labels skittered all over the platen, getting glue all over the inside of the typewriter. About every 50 or so labels, the platen had to be taken out and cleaned with alcohol. I typed and typed. By 3 o’clock I knew I was in trouble. The production workers had come over to my desk to help me affix the sticky labels. We were nervous, labels were getting screwed up. At 3:30 the office manager and receptionist came back to my desk to help with the labels. I typed and typed, and tried not to cry. We didn’t make it. The plant manager was flustered. The salesman who’d promised the job was really pissed off, he said mean things. I apologized again and again, they told me it wasn’t all my fault, but could I please be more careful what I committed myself to in future. I could tell they also expected me to get a hell of a lot faster, but they were just trying to be nice. So, I got faster. I came in early in the morning and worked through lunch until I got better at my job. I had signed up for a typing job, nobody had described all the weird stuff they expected me to type.",
      "So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself. You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private.",

Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample complexity, and solve partially observable tasks. Emergent communication, a type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language to encode a high task-utility message directly from data.",
      "Next, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy. We evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds. Environments\n\nBlind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location. Ten agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes. During each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly. See figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 × 500 pixels. Thus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.",
      "Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information. We show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication. In order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues. We interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination. The social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing. The idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios. In real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch.",
      "However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'. INTRODUCTION\n\nSocial learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination. In humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination. Especially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations . However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication."

If, on the other hand, we want to write down the time evolution for particles $U$ and $D$, let us denote it by $r_{U,D}(T)$, we need to evaluate the expression (\\ref{RadialOrbitTime}) at the initial location $r_0=R\\pm\\Delta l$. Since $\\Delta l$ is small, we can make a Taylor expansion of $\\beta(r)$ and its derivative around $r=R$, and neglect everything beyond the terms linear in $\\Delta l$.

      "The initial radial coordinate value for each of the particles is\n\\begin{equation}\nr(T_0) = \\sqrt{R^2+\\Delta l^2}=R\\left[1+\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\Delta l}{R}\\right)^2\\right]\\approx R,\n\\end{equation}\nthat is, equal to $R,$ as long as we neglect any terms that are higher than linear in $\\Delta l$. In consequence, $r_{L,R}(t)$ is the same function as for our central particle, given by eq.~(\\ref{RadialOrbitTime}) with $r_0=R$. The transversal (in Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}: horizontal) distance $d_{\\perp}(T)$ between the particles $L$ and $R$ changes in proportion to the radius value,\n\\begin{align}\nd_{\\perp}(T) &= 2\\Delta l\\cdot\\frac{r_{L}(T)}{R} \\nonumber \\\\\n                 &=2\\Delta \\left[1-\\frac{c\\beta(R)}{R}\\Delta T+\\frac{c^2}{2}\\frac{B(R)}{R}\\Delta T^2\\right]. \\label{dPerp}\n\\end{align}\nWith these preparations, consider the vacuum Einstein equation (\\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) for the volume of a test ball. Initially, our particles $C, U, D, L, R$ define a circle, which is deformed to an ellipse. By demanding rotational symmetry around the radial direction, we can construct the associated ellipsoid, which is initially a spherical surface. That ellipsoid has one axis in radial direction, whose length is $d_{\\parallel}(T)$, and two axes that are transversal and each have the length  $d_{\\perp}(t)$. But that ellipsoid is not quite yet the test ball we need. After all, the particles of the test ball need to be at rest initially, at time $T_0$, in the co-moving system defined by the central particle $C$. Our defining particles are not, as the terms linear in $\\Delta T$ in both (\\ref{dParallel}) and (\\ref{dPerp}) show, where the coefficients of $\\Delta T$ correspond to the particles' initial velocities. In order to define our test ball, we need to consider particles at the same location, undergoing the same acceleration, but which are initially at rest relative to the central particle $C$. We could go back to the drawing board, back to Fig.~\\ref{TestParticlesOutside}, make a more general Ansatz that includes initial velocities which measure the divergence of the motion of our test ball particles from that of the infalling-observer particles, and repeat our calculation while including those additional velocity terms.",
      "It is the consequence of these special choices that gives the relation (\\ref{barRshift}) its simple form. Last but not least, when we analyse specifically an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the point $r,\\vartheta,\\varphi$, let us make the choice that directly at our point of interest, we make $\\bar{r}$ coincide with $r$.

By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric in terms of the locally co-moving coordinates $T,\\bar{r},\\vartheta,\\varphi$ is the spherical-coordinate version of the Minkowski metric,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 + \\mathrm{d}\\bar{r}^2 + \\bar{r}^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega. \\end{equation}\nThis version can, of course, be obtained by taking the more familiar Cartesian-coordinate version\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2=-c^2\\mathrm{d} T^2 + \\mathrm{d} X^2 + \\mathrm{d} Y^2 + \\mathrm{d} Z^2,\n\\label{CartesianMinkowski}\n\\end{equation}\napplying the definition of Cartesian coordinates $X,Y,Z$ in terms of spherical coordinates $\\bar{r},\\vartheta,\\varphi$\n\\begin{equation}\nx= \\bar{r}\\:\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\cos\\varphi, \\;\\;\ny= \\bar{r}\\:\\sin\\vartheta\\:\\sin\\varphi, \\;\\;\nz= \\bar{r}\\:\\cos\\vartheta,\n\\end{equation}\nto express $\\mathrm{d} X, \\mathrm{d} Y, \\mathrm{d} Z$ in terms of $\\mathrm{d} \\bar{r}, \\mathrm{d}\\vartheta, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi$, and substitute the result into (\\ref{CartesianMinkowski}). By noting that we have chosen $\\bar{r}$ so that, at the specific spacetime event where we are evaluating the metric, $\\bar{r}=r$, while, for small radial coordinate shifts around that location, we have the relation (\\ref{barRshift}), we can now write down the same metric in the coordinates $T, r, \\vartheta,\\varphi$, namely as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\left [\n1-\\beta(r)^2\n\\right] \\mathrm{d} T^2+2c\\beta(r)\\mathrm{d} r\\:\\mathrm{d} T\n+\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2. \\label{preMetric}\n\\end{equation}\nSince we can repeat that local procedure at any event in our spacetime, this result is our general form of the metric, for all values of $r$. This, then is the promised simplification: By exploiting the symmetries of our solutions as well as the properties of infalling observers, we have reduced our metric to a simple form with no more than one unknown function of one variable, namely $\\beta(r)$.\n\nSo far, what I have presented is no more than a long-form version of the initial steps of the derivation given by Visser in his heuristic derivation of the Schwarzschild metric.\\cite{Visser2005} In the next section, we will deviate from Visser's derivation.",
      "By (\\ref{BigBDefinition}), the solution (\\ref{BSolution}) corresponds to the differential equation\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r)\\beta'(r) = \\frac{C}{r^2}\n\\end{equation}\nfor our function $\\beta$; with another separation of variables, we can re-write this as \n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\beta=C\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}. \\end{equation}\nBoth sides are readily integrated up; we can solve the result for $\\beta(r)$ and obtain\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\n-\\frac{2C}{r} +2D\n},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D$ is the second integration constant, and where we have chosen the proper sign, since we know that $\\beta(r)>0$. That brings us to the last step: The requirement that, for large values of $r$, the description provided by our solution should correspond to the results from Newtonian gravity. First of all, we note that our initial condition for the infalling observers, which had those observers start out at zero speed at infinity, means that we must choose $D=0$. Then, as we would expect, $\\beta(r)$ for large values of $r$ becomes very small, corresponding to small speeds. But at slow speeds, time and length intervals as measured by the infalling observer will become arbitrarily close to time and length intervals as measured by an observer at rest in our static coordinate system at constant $r$, using the static time coordinate ${t}$. As is usual, we identify these coordinates with those of an approximately Newtonian description. In that description, the radial velocity is\n\\begin{equation}\nv(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich follows directly from energy conservation for the sum of each observer's kinetic and Newtonian-gravitational potential energy. This fixes the remaining integration constant as\n\\begin{equation}\nC = -\\frac{GM}{c^2},\n\\end{equation}\nand the final form of our function $\\beta(r)$ becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}. \\end{equation}\nInserting this result in (\\ref{preMetric}), we obtain the metric\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\\left[\n1-\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\n\\right]\\mathrm{d} T^2+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\mathrm{d} r\\:\\mathrm{d} T+\\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2."
