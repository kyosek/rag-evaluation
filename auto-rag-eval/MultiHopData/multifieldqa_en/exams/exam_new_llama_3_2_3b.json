    "question": "What is the likely reason why McPherson County has historically been carried by Republican candidates, despite being located in a state that has trended Democratic in recent presidential elections?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The county's median income is significantly higher than the state median income, indicating a more affluent population that is more likely to vote Republican.",
      "B) The county's population is disproportionately older, with a high percentage of residents over the age of 65, which tends to vote Republican.",
      "C) The county's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, which has historically been a Republican stronghold, and this has contributed to the county's voting patterns.",
      "D) The county's history of being a \"dry\" county, with a long period of prohibition, has led to a cultural and social conservatism that is more aligned with Republican values, and this has contributed to the county's voting patterns."

      "McPherson County (standard abbreviation: MP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson. History\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican\u2013American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County. Peketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas."

      "Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain. The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich \u03b3-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body."

The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}.

    "question": "In the context of American democratic theory, what is the primary concern of oracular democracy, as discussed in the seminar, and how does it relate to the tension between power and accountability inherent in the presidency, as examined in Bruce Ackerman's work?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Oracular democracy is concerned with the role of public opinion in shaping policy decisions, and its relationship to the presidency is one of mutual accountability, where the president is held accountable by the public for their actions.",
      "B) Oracular democracy is a form of direct democracy, where citizens make decisions directly, and its relationship to the presidency is one of tension, where the president's power is limited by the need for public input.",
      "C) Oracular democracy is concerned with the role of expert advisors in shaping policy decisions, and its relationship to the presidency is one of delegation, where the president delegates power to experts, who are then accountable to the public.",
      "D) Oracular democracy is a form of deliberative democracy, where citizens engage in deliberative processes to make decisions, and its relationship to the presidency is one of symbiosis, where the president works with citizens to make decisions that reflect the common good."

      "This fundamental debate reveals what is a stake in the basic architecture of the American regime. The second part of the course is a close study of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America. Regarded by many as the best book ever written on democracy and the best book written on America, Tocqueville sees our polity whole because he looks at it from the vantage point of Europe, in general, and France, in particular. In the third part of the seminar we think about American politics from the perspective of thoughtful commentators who feel only nominally included in the polity. Half in and half out, these extraordinary black American writers reveal fissures and fault lines in the American regime. We end the class with a discussion of America\u2019s place in the world today \u2013 examining a speech by a writer who articulately raises challenges to our self-understanding that are inarticulately expressed today in rage and ranting from enemies of the United States. Three take home analytic essays, chosen from a list of topics I provide, each weighted 25% of the course grade. Late essays will not be accepted, except with a doctor\u2019s excuse or a Dean\u2019s excuse for family emergency. OR as an option: you may write the two short essays (both together weighted 25%) and do a longer 15 page paper on a topic of your choice in consultation with me (weighted 50% of your course grade). Government honors students who are thinking of doing an honors thesis next year may prefer this option to begin to develop research and writing skills for longer work. Students who prefer this option will need to designate their preferred third short essay and have discussed with me a topic for their long paper by March 30.

This course covers more theory, and the readings are more demanding, than other versions of GOV 310. One of the main objectives of the course is to deepen your understanding of the practical aspects of contemporary public affairs by developing your ability to understand the theoretical foundations of American politics. Although we cover the nuts and bolts of politics there is much more theory in this version of GOV 310. If you have registered for this section mainly because 310 is a legislative requirement that you need to fulfill, this is not the right version for you. There is a substantial workload in this class. Regular attendance, thorough and timely preparation, and active participation are all necessary to do well. Four essays (approximately 1000 words each). Three of these will be assigned analytic essay topics. The last will be a book review of a title chosen by the student from a long list of provided possibilities. (15% each essay, 60% of total course grade)\nTwo in-class tests. These will count 15% each, 30% of total course grade. Class participation. (10% of course grade). Both informed participation and occasional leadership of the seminar will be graded. No make-up exams or late papers, except for documented medical or other emergencies. Mark Landy and Sidney M.
