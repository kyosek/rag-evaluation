      "Twelve women presented their research at this meeting with funding by the WCC/Eli Lilly Travel Grant Award. WCC members also spent time educating expo attendees on programs offered by the ACS Office of Diversity Programs at its new booth. In Chicago, the Younger Chemists Committee (YCC) welcomed its new committee members with an information session centered on YCC's charter as well as on its strategic plan: to make ACS relevant to younger chemists, to involve younger chemists in all levels of the society, and to integrate younger chemists into the profession. In January, YCC again hosted a Leadership Development Workshop during the ACS Leaders Conference. There were more than 80 applications for the 15 awards, which covered travel and registration for the conference. YCC plans to again fund the travel awards and provide leadership training for young chemists in 2008. YCC also solicited applications and selected a new graduate student representative on the Graduate Education Advisory Board. During the Chicago meeting, YCC programs included \"Starting a Successful Research Program at a Predominantly Undergraduate Institution,\" \"Career Experiences at the Interface of Chemistry & Biology,\" and \"Chemistry Pedagogy 101.\" In addition to these programs, YCC cosponsored five programs with various committees and divisions. YCC continues to reach out to ACS committees and divisions and has initiated liaisonships with 11 technical divisions to encourage technical programming that highlights the contributions of younger chemists. Looking forward to Boston, YCC is planning symposia including \"The Many Faces of Chemistry: International Opportunities for Chemists\"; \"Being a Responsible Chemist: Ethics, Politics & Policy\"; and \"Changing Landscapes of the Bio-Pharma Industry. \"\nThe Committee on Committees (ConC) conducted its annual training session for new national committee chairs at the ACS Leaders Conference in January 2007. ConC's interactive session for committee chairs in Chicago served as an opportune follow-on and a forum for informative interchange among seasoned and new chairs."

The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}.

      "In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits . Conclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation. We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels. In particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions . This provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks. Nonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states."

      "(\\ref{eq:deltas}). Moreover, we move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) at given $\\mathbb{T}$, looking at  all configurations of input fields.

Indeed, starting from Eq. \\eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account. The space of solutions is  delimited by the total power ${\\cal P}$ received by system, i.e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm in}: \\{E^{\\rm in} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm in}_k = \\mathcal{P}\\}$, also implying  a constraint on the total amount of energy that is transmitted through the medium, i. e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm out}:\\{E^{\\rm out} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm out}_k=c\\mathcal{P}\\}$, where the attenuation factor  $c<1$ accounts for total losses.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time."

      "JoVE | Peer Reviewed Scientific Video Journal - Methods and Protocols\nA role for thrombospondin-1 deficits in astrocyte-mediated spine and synaptic pathology in Downs syndrome. Octavio Garcia, Maria Torres, Pablo Helguera, Pinar Coskun, Jorge Busciglio. PUBLISHED: 07-02-2010\tDowns syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However, the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance, astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons. We have previously shown impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes leading to metabolic alterations in protein processing and secretion. In this study, we investigated whether deficits in astrocyte function contribute to DS spine pathology. Analysis of Dendritic Spine Morphology in Cultured CNS Neurons Authors: Deepak P. Srivastava, Kevin M. Woolfrey, Peter Penzes. Published: 07-13-2011 JoVE Neuroscience\nDendritic spines are the sites of the majority of excitatory connections within the brain, and form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses. These structures are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. In response to classical Hebbian plasticity as well as neuromodulatory signals, dendritic spines can change shape and number, which is thought to be critical for the refinement of neural circuits and the processing and storage of information within the brain. Within dendritic spines, a complex network of proteins link extracellular signals with the actin cyctoskeleton allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that a number of disease states, ranging from schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders, display abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers. Moreover, recent genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to suggestions that these proteins may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity that, in part, underlie the pathophysiology of these disorders."

      "English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\". Opposition (1999\u20132008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. Leader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\". Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote."

BLITZER: What's taking so long? Why haven't you been able to meet with Gadhafi yet? WELDON: Well, it -- that's not unusual. I mean all three of the delegation trips that I led here in 2003 and 2004 -- or, actually, 2004 and 2005 -- they always make you wait until 30 minutes before the meeting and then you go. And some of those meetings were at 10:00 at night, some were at 5:00 in the afternoon. As you know from the excellent reporting being done by your folks here, there's a lot of security concerns, and they are very concerned where Gadhafi is at any given moment. That's one of the issues, but we have been making ourselves available. We have been doing a lot of back-channel meetings with friends and associates that I have here, and we have met with the chief of staff and one of the sons, and today with the prime minister, a very lengthy meeting for two hours. So, we're going to give them until tomorrow. We're not going to stay beyond that. And we have given them some suggestions, and we expect a response by midday tomorrow. And if we don't, we will done exit conversation with your people and let you know our feelings.\nBLITZER: What's the major headline that you got out of these meetings with other leaders? I take it you met with Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi, one of the sons of Moammar Gadhafi. What are they saying to you? WELDON: Well, we actually didn't meet with Saif. I have met with Saif probably 10 times over the past seven years, both in America and here in Libya. I have not yet met with Saif. I have offered, if he is available. I have met with Saadi. And the general thrust is obviously that they want peace and they want to find a way out of this. But as I have explained to them, there's certain things that have to be done according to our president and our secretary of state, who I'm here to support."

Thanks for your feedback!\nSlightly reduced the frequency and duration of Juggernaut\u2019s \u201cUnstoppable\u201d ability. \u2022 He was indeed a bit too...unstoppable. We\u2019ve toned down the frequency this ability triggers, as well as reduced the duration it\u2019s active for when it does trigger. We feel Juggernaut is still a powerful Champion despite these revisions. Take care! Slightly reduced the starting values of Wolverine's \u201cCellular Regeneration\u201d. \u2022 We found that Cellular Regeneration was too strong at lower levels where fewer counters to Regeneration exist. Re-scaled Gamora's \u201cAssassination\u201d to start higher but scale slower. \u2022 At lower levels, Special Attacks were used too infrequently, giving this powerful ability little visibility. We\u2019ve adjusted the scaling to better match Special Attack usage at all levels. Increased the frequency that Black Bolt\u2019s \u201cProvocation\u201d triggers. \u2022 Due to the varying Critical Hit rates across all Champions, in some cases Provocation would trigger rarely or not at all within a fight. We\u2019ve increased the frequency to ensure you\u2019ll see it every match \u2013 but especially so against opponents with high Critical Hit rates. We\u2019ll continue to follow the effect of these new abilities on gameplay. Please keep your feedback coming! Hey everyone! We have been hard at work on improving the game and have prepared a big update inspired in part by your great community feedback.

After all, self-maintenance is a definitive feature of the life process and would suggest that any life process must include the regeneration of its components.

It should be noted that there are numerous quantitative features to this, such as the clarity with which this goal of self as it \"should be\" is represented, the determination/flexibility with which it is adhered to (or in other words the range of circumstances which can be handled in holding to this goal).\nby TheVat on April 24th, 2018, 1:52 pm\nIt seems likely a paramecium does no representing to a self, and is pretty much a cellular machine lacking sentience."

Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages. Language Identification Models\n\nMany multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification . Recent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%. Dialect Classification\n\nDialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise . Dialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option.

Revolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force. Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy. The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier. Later service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B.

To accomplish this, we\u2019ve given WW2 Cap the ability to Stun with his Special 1 and Special 3 attacks, but kept his Bleed on Special 2 the same, giving him options during combat against non-bleeding champions. A bug that prevented Daredevil from triggering Armor Breaks from Heavy Attacks has been fixed and is now working as intended. Against non-bleeding champions: Critical Hits have a chance to Armor Break on Special Attacks. Increase range of Signature to 25% from 20%. Many players found Elektra\u2019s signature ability lacked enough opportunities to use it. To remedy this, we\u2019ve increased the range from 20% to 25%. Additionally, to help make Elektra unique from other skill champions, we\u2019ve given her the ability to deal with naturally Bleed Immune champions. Note: This Armor Break only applies to champions naturally immune to bleed, such as Colossus and Ultron, and not to champions granted Bleed Immunity from Local or Link Nodes. Guillotine\u2019s Bleed effect used to have a chance to activate from any given attack, meaning that it had to be kept quite weak to compensate for the frequency of triggers. We\u2019ve made the switch to have her Bleed behave closer to existing champions, and in doing so have boosted the strength of the Bleed and have allowed it to stack. Norman Osborn overloads the Arc Reactor in his chest if Health drops below 10%, granting a large burst of power, with (18% - 48% ) Armor, Regeneration, and Power Gain. After that, his suit burns out and cannot trigger Armor Up, Armor Break or Stun and loses all base Armor. Many players didn\u2019t like Iron Patriot\u2019s old signature ability, feeling that due to the lack of Regeneration, it was considerably weaker than Iron Man\u2019s. While we agreed, we didn\u2019t want to just copy and paste his signature ability, but rather give him his own unique twist on the ability."

      "These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the \"Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio\"), Mitch Berg and others. The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years. But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication. (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann. Sports Radio\nKSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010. As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox. As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period. One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change. In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center. It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz. The original translator was discontinued. On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as \"SKOR North\" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, \"Skol, Vikings\"), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff."

      "Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints. However, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging. Prior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences. To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph. Each time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief. On the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal."

      "For a long response with small time steps, the time domain methods are very costly in computational time. Volterra series is another widely used method, which is the extension of the Duhamel integral for linear systems . Volterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenomena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional convolution integrals . Since 1980's, significant progress has been made in the general area of the Volterra series. The reader is referred to Ref. for a quite thorough literature review on the relevant topics. After 2017, most papers focus on Volterra series identification. De Paula and Marques proposed a method for the identification of Volterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural networks. Son and Kim presented a method for a direct estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients. Dalla Libera et al. introduced two new kernels for Volterra series identification. Peng et al. used the measured response to identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear structural damage detection. Only a few papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of convolution integrals. Traditional methods for computing convolution integrals involved in the Volterra series have been performed in three distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time domain method based on Volterra series refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suffer computational cost problems . Both the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain method based on the Volterra series consist of three steps: (1) Volterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain or Laplace domain; the algebraic equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and (3) the solution in Step ( ) is transformed back to the time domain. Many researchers have used the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonlinear systems. Billings et al. developed a new method for identifying the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) of nonlinear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response based on these GFRFs."

Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation.

Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods. One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School.

      "This does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not \nintroduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot \ndistances much larger than the coherence length, where $\\GS{\\rm X}\\to 0$.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the \nCAR efficiency as $\\mathcal{C} \\equiv \\GS{\\rm X} / \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\\mathcal{C} < 1$\nin the wide range of $\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \\fig{3}.

For a change as small as $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the \nconventional Kondo regime, compare \\fig{C}(a) with \\fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, \nhowever, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused\nby CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \\fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$\nleads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the\nincreased critical $\\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the\nshallowing of the dip.

In the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry \nwith respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,\nit leads to the two-stage Kondo\nscreening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms. This CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual \nlow-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case.

      "An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952. Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts. But World War II put a hold on the development of television. In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota. With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate. From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart. KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years. There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts. MOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station. But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music. KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. \"15 KSTP, The Music Station\" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year. As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980. In 1982, it officially shifted to talk. Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band.

But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing. Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk. Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs."

      "This week, workers plugged a crack in the plant that had been gushing contaminated water into the ocean for weeks. As a result, TEPCO says now radiation levels in the ocean waters off the coast there have dropped dramatically. Yesterday, the head of the United Nations' scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation said the Fukushima accident is not expected to have any serious impact on the health of the Japanese people. He said, quote: \"We have seen traces of iodine in the air all over the world, but they are much, much, much lower than traces we have seen at similar distances following Chernobyl,\" unquote. Well, not everybody is convinced. In South Korea, more than 130 primary schools and kindergartens ordered closed today outside of Seoul. People there were worried that windy, rainy weather could be carrying radioactive material from Japan. North Korea aired warnings on television for its people to stay indoors during that rain storm and to take a full shower if they were caught outside in the storm. Even here in the United States, some chefs are now using sensors to test levels of radiation in the fish they plan to serve in restaurants. Here's the question -- do you think you're being told the truth about the nuclear accident in Japan? If your -- if your trout is he glowing, Wolf --\nBLITZER: Yes?\nCAFFERTY: -- you might want to send it back and get a ham sandwich. BLITZER: You want it well done, but not necessarily that well done. CAFFERTY: No.\nBLITZER: All right, Jack. Not a laughing matter. BLITZER: Serious stuff. CAFFERTY: Right. BLITZER: See you in a few moments. New questions this hour about the capabilities of the rebels in Libya and whether they have the power to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi. Should the United States -- should the United States have a hand in helping arm the rebels? Let's bring in our foreign affairs correspondent, Jill Dougherty, with this part of the story.

    "documentation": [
      "To optimize the use of human input and quickly infer the human's preference, Fig. : An autonomous robot navigates in a simulated classroom towards a goal location (pink circle). At the start of its mission, it receives direction indications (arrows) from a human that indicate which path it should take to get to the goal. In this scenario, the human wants the robot to go around the desks on the right side of the classroom. A robot that does not reason over path preferences (green) will take the shortest path to the goal regardless of the human's input. Our method (blue) infers the human's path preference from these indications and adapts to their recommendations. we propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback. Previous research by Bajcsy et al. considered an online adaptation problem in a manipulation task, where the person can apply forces to the robot to indicate their preferences. By allowing the robot to continue its task while taking into account a probabilistic representation of human preference, their approach does not require frequent inputs. Building on this idea, we adopt a similar approach to adapt to a human's preference in the context of a robot autonomously navigating through a known environment, such as a cluttered office space. Specifically, we focus on allowing the human to influence the robot's trajectory with respect to obstacles, by providing guidance on preferred routes or paths, while the robot continues to execute its task. Paths can be represented using homotopy classes . However, homotopies can pose computational challenges when used to encode and infer human preferences. When the robot maintains a belief over homotopy classes, the inference problem can become exponentially complex with the number of obstacles in the space. Additionally, when the goal is unknown, the number of variables increases with the number of candidate destinations. This complexity can render the decision-making problem intractable."

      "More money from various players might mean they can limit the players who spend a ton and still generate a healthy income.

Its tricky. ey dun new ho to yet it uff. Yet you complain almost everyday here, on your website, Twitter, and YouTube channel that the game needs to change because cubing has such an impact. It was fun. Swarm had me scared at first, but it turned into kind of a bullying match between us and legion. Last hour became p obvious which way it was gonna go. Legion rly stepped up their game in the end there, respect. We are investigating this. Here is what we know: Several of the accounts used the same password. Most of the accounts belonged to people who knew each other personally. The accounts were all switched from the same IP Addresses. The person who logged in, got into each account on the first attempt, so they knew the password for each account. What you should know: QONQR never stores passwords, not even in the logs. Passwords are hashed (one way encrypted) and can never be decrypted When you authenticate to our servers, we hash the password you gave us and compare it to the encrypted password in the database to see if they match. Access to our database in the could is restricted tightly and we are confident no one breached the system. What you should do: Don't use the same password as other people you play with. Don't share your password with anyone. I heard all the French players fled to the UK after one German player accidentally shot a single missile into France. Most factions now use GroupMe or Line as their means of communication, the forums are too slow as a means of communication and insecure for specific faction conversations. Think of the forums are more of a gaming information resource rather than a means of communication.

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "In DBM modeling, the CE multiscale analysis is used to determine quickly the reserved kinetic moments. Specifically, when constructing a DBM which only the first order term of Kn number is retained (i.e., only the first order TNE effects are retained), seven kinetic moments should be reserved, i.e., the M 0 , M 1 , M 2,0 , M 2 , M 3,1 , M 3 , M 4,2 . Two more kinetic moments ( M 4 and M 5,3 ) are needed when the second order TNE is considered . However, it should be noted that the function of CE analysis in DBM modeling is only to determine the kinetic moments that need to be preserved. Whether or not to derive the hydrodynamic equations does not affect the DBM simulation. The kinetic moments used in our physical modeling are shown in the Appendix B. Their expressions can be obtained by integrating v and \u03b7 with continuous-form f eq . For better understanding, the Appendix C gives the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations recovered from the Boltzmann equation. The kinetic moments in Appendix B can be written in matrix form, i.e., C \u2022 f \u03c3 ,eq = f\u03c3,eq , (\nwhere C is the matrix of discrete velocity and feq represents the kinetic moments. A proper discrete velocity model is needed to confirm the values of f \u03c3 ,eq i . The f \u03c3 ,eq can be obtained by solving the inverse matrix, i.e., f \u03c3 ,eq = C \u22121 \u2022 f\u03c3,eq , where C \u22121 is the inverse matrix of C. It is very convenient to obtain the inverse matrix of C through some mathematical softwares such as Mathematica, etc. The D2V16 model is chosen in this paper, its sketches can be seen in Fig. . The specific values of D2V16 are given in the following equations: where \"cyc\" indicates cyclic permutation and c is an adjustable parameter of the discrete velocity model. The sketch of \u03b7 in D2V16 is \u03b7 i = \u03b7 0 for i = 1 \u2212 4, and \u03b7 i = 0 for i = 5 \u2212 16.

We discussed the fact that people would say things that did not mean what they souneded like - such as \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\". As we did these things he worked hard to better understand communication with others. During his 4th grade year I had a teacher from the gifted program ask me if I had ever heard of Aspergers. I told her that I had not heard of it. She proceeded to read me some of the charateristics and so many of them described my son. So we had him tested by the school district during the summer between 4th and 5th grade and they did find that he had Aspergers but that he was high functioning. We then set him up with and EIP which stayed with him until his sophomore year. We pulled him from it at that time because we had moved and the new district was requiring him to take one class a day that was a study class. This reduced the number of required classes he could take and he was doing fine with his studies at the time. It was during the 2nd half of his Junior year that we noticed some of his grades going down. Then during his Senior year is when he started skipping classes and not doing assignments. We had not realized it before then but we soon became aware that he was addicted to gaming. He would go to the library or somewhere else on campus and play games on the computer rather than go to class. It was also at this time that he began lying about his actions (so as not to get in trouble). Based on his grades and his ACT score he received offers from colleges for full tuition scholarships. He chose the college where he had taken concurrent classes during his high school years. But he proceeded to skip class and not turn in assignments so he lost his scholarship and quit attending college. During this time he was only able to find employment through an employment agency where he was mostly sent to manuel labor type jobs (which is not something he enjoys but he did it anyway)."

      "In that scenario, Intel may not totally abandon the market but they might just stick to manufacturing SoCs on nodes that are a step or two behind the state of the art. I think the processing is a bigger advantage than many realize. If Intel can stay ahead in process design - which this article seems to indicate - they should have a major advantage. All else being equal a 14nm chip should be significantly faster and more efficient than the same chip at 22nm. Add in the fact that yields increase geometrically - you can fit a lot more 14nm chips on a given wafer size vs 22nm (or 32nm for the other manufacturers.) and you have a very appealing proposition. And then add in the fact that Intel actually has a pretty good graphics stack and IP. My point was that Intel might have a one or two process advantage over the rest of the industry at the cutting edge but that doesn't mean that they can afford to manufacture on those processes for very low margin parts. If the SoC market becomes increasingly commoditised, there isn't going to be the money to justify making them in a state of the art fab. Remember that one of the big selling points of Itanium was that it would make use of process advantages that were effectively paid for by the mainstream x86 market. That didn't quite work out in practice and Itanium processors were often well behind Xeons in process technology. paul5ra wrote:As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy.

Still, it is worth noticing the existence of a few cryptoassets (9 of them) with relatively small market capitalization (ranking below the top 1000) for which the power-law hypothesis is always rejected (Supplementary Table ). Having verified that large price movements in the cryptocurrency market are generally well-described by powerlaw distributions, we now focus on the power-law exponents that typically characterize each cryptoasset. To do so, we select all exponent estimates over the entire history of each digital asset for which the power-law hypothesis is not rejected and calculate their median values for both the positive ( \u03b1+ ) and negative ( \u03b1\u2212 ) returns. The dashed lines in Fig. ) show these median values for Bitcoin where \u03b1+ = 4.50 and \u03b1\u2212 = 2.99.

Thus, while the typical variance of large positive returns is finite for Bitcoin, negative returns are at the limit of not having a typical scale and are thus susceptible to much larger variations. Figure shows the probability distribution for the median power-law exponents of all cryptoassets grouped by large positive and negative returns. We note that the distribution of typical power-law exponents associated with large positive returns is shifted to smaller values when compared with the distribution of exponents related to large negative returns.

      "Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo. After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads."

If A then B does not allow you affirm A, so by equating these two you have committed a logical fallacy. Furthermore it is amazing how far out on a limb you go to concoct such an attack.

Libertarians accept the incompatibility premise that holds agents morally responsible for free actions. Incompatibilism maintains that determinism is incompatible with human freedom. Libertarians accept that there are free actions, and in doing so, believe that we are morally responsible for some of our actions, namely, the free ones. The libertarian ONLY claims that we do have free will actions and affirm the incompatibility of determinism with free will.

      "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane. This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes. While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat."

It implies some sort of sentient observer. It implies a subjective aspect.

It is a product of self organization, and the learning process which is evolution. I certainly agree with the term \"biological machinery,\" which is to say that there is no reason to distinguish things simply on the basis that one uses the interactions of organic chemistry. Thus I think the locus of difference between the living organism and the machine has to do with origins whether it is by design or by learning, evolution, and self-organization.

      "In training, we use the MSE loss between the degraded image and the output of the network, and we optimize the loss using the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate equal to 0.01 . In our experiments, we also used \u03b1 = 0.15 as an optimal proportion coefficient for reconstruction loss. Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we introduced a novel framework for contour completion using deep structure priors (DSP). This work offers a novel notion of a maskless grouping of fragmented contours. In our proposed framework, we introduced a novel loss metric that does not require a strict definition of the mask. Instead, it lets the model learn the perceivable illusory contours and connects those fragmented pieces using a generator network that is solely trained on just the single incomplete input image. Our model does not require any pre-training which demonstrates that the convolutional architecture of the hour-glass model is able to connect disconnected contours. We present an extended set of experiments that show the capability of our algorithm. We investigate the effect of each parameter introduced in our algorithm separately and show how one could possibly achieve the best result for their problem using this model. In future work, we plan to extend this model and try to see how it performs with real images. In particular, we want to determine whether we can inpaint real-world photographs while retaining perceptually aware scene structures. The importance of shape in perception by deep neural networks has been highlighted in many adversarial examples to appearance-based networks . The outcome of this work has strong potential to impact the designing and implementation of models that are robust to such perturbations."

    "correct_answer": "B)",
    "documentation": [
      "Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest shark fishing nation [9, 14], and a global priority for shark conservation . Until recently Indonesia\u2019s shark fishery has largely functioned as de facto open-access [12, 16]. However, in the past five years the Indonesian government has demonstrated a clear commitment to shark conservation and resource management, with domestic measures put in place to implement international obligations under CITES . Exploitation of all CITES-listed species is now regulated, either through full species protection or export controls (these species are hereafter referred to as \u2018regulated\u2019 species). However, CITES only affords protection to a small number of Indonesia\u2019s 112 known shark species , of which 83 are threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e. Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) or Critically Endangered (CR) , these species are hereafter referred to as \u2018threatened\u2019 species), many of which continue to be landed throughout the country . Further, these policy measures predominantly regulate trade at the point of export, but do not necessarily influence fisher behaviour or local demand at the point of catch, such that the \u2018trickle-down\u2019 impacts on species mortality are unknown. In addition, effectively implementing species-specific shark mortality controls remains challenging due to the non-selectivity of fishing gears, and practical and cultural barriers to changing fisher preferences for certain gear-types and fishing methods. As such, existing regulations alone (e.g. Indonesian Law on Fisheries 31/2004 and its derivative regulations) will likely be insufficient to curb mortality of threatened and regulated species, as fishers must be both willing and able to change their fishing behaviour . Moreover, most of Indonesia\u2019s shark fisheries are small-scale, and in relatively poor coastal communities where there are often no legal, sustainable marine-based alternatives to shark fishing that offer similar financial returns [22, 23]."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "In the first stage (t < 0.03), cases with different specific-heat ratios show various trends. At the stage where the bubble deformation is not very large, i.e., 0.03 < t < 0.06, values of \u1e60NOEF fluctuate near the average value. In the third stage (t > 0.06), evolutions of \u1e60NOEF in cases with larger specific-heat ratios show an apparent growing tendency. Differently, the values of \u1e60NOEF in cases with smaller specific-heat ratios remain almost unchanged. The influence of specific heat ratio on the \u1e60NOEF , similar with the effect on NOEF, is also affected by the heat conductivity and the temperature gradient. It can be seen that, except for the case of \u03b3 = 1.09, the larger the specific-heat ratio, the higher entropy production rate \u1e60NOEF . The temporal evolutions of \u1e60NOEF of case \u03b3 = 1.09 and case \u03b3 = 1.12 are very similar. Consequently, the specific-heat ratio increases the \u1e60NOEF by raising the temperature gradient. Further understanding can be seen in Fig. , where the entropy productions over this period are plotted. For convenience, the sum and difference between S NOMF and S NOEF are also plotted in the figure. The variation range of S NOEF is larger than that of S NOMF . It indicates that the influence of specific-heat ratio on S NOEF is more significant than that on S NOMF . Effects of specific-heat ratio on entropy production caused by NOMF and NOEF are contrary. Specifically, it can be seen that the entropy production contributed by NOMF increases with re- duced specific-heat ratio. But the entropy production caused by NOEF first reduces with decreasing specific-heat ratio and then approaches to a saturation value. The S NOEF in case \u03b3 = 1.09 is almost the same with it in case \u03b3 = 1.12. When the specificheat ratio \u03b3 is smaller than a threshold value \u03b3 c (\u03b3 c \u2248 1.315), the entropy production induced by NOEF is more significant than that caused by NOMF. However, in the case of \u03b3 > \u03b3 c , the situation reverses. The temporal evolution of the total entropy production (S NOMF +S NOEF ) is similar to the S NOEF profile."

Inference and Learning\n\nGiven the probabilistic relations , our goal is to infer the latent variables z 0:T as well as all model parameters \u03b8. We follow a hybrid Bayesian approach in which the posterior of the state variables is approximated using amortized Variational Inference and Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) point-estimates for \u03b8 are computed. The application of Bayes' rule for each data sequence x 0:T leads to the following posterior: where p(\u03b8) denotes the prior on the model parameters. In the context of variational inference, we use the following factorization of the approximate posterior i.e. we infer only the mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c3 for each state variable based on the given data points. This conditional density used for inference is the encoder-counterpart to the probabilistic decoder defined in the section before. It can be readily shown that the optimal parameter values are found by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) F(q \u03c6 (z 0:T ), \u03b8) which is derived in Appendix B. We compute Monte Carlo estimates of the gradient of the ELBO with respect to \u03c6 and \u03b8 with the help of the reparametrization trick and carry out stochastic optimization with the ADAM algorithm .\n\nResults for the probabilistic extension\n\nWe applied our probabilistic version to the KS-equation. We used the same settings as for the deterministic approach but considered up to 10 complex latent variables. The obtained \u03bb's are in Figure . The probabilistic model allows us to quantify the uncertainty in predictions. In Figure predictions for various time-steps and the respective uncertainty bounds are shown for an unseen initial condition. Due to the chaotic nature of the KS-equation and the small amount of training data, the underlying linear dynamic of our model is only able to capture the full dynamics for a limited time horizon."

A previous exploratory study suggested that fruit consumption may reduce mercury exposure. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fruit consumption on the relation between fish consumption and bioindicators of mercury (Hg) exposure in Amazonian fish-eating communities. A cross-sectional dietary survey based on a 7-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency was conducted within 13 riparian communities from the Tapajos River, Brazilian Amazon. Hair samples were collected from 449 persons, and blood samples were collected from a subset of 225, for total and inorganic mercury determination by atomic absorption spectrometry. On average, participants consumed 6.6 fish meals/week and ate 11 fruits/week. The average blood Hg (BHg) was 57.1\u00c2\u00b136.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/L (median: 55.1 \u00ce\u00bcg/L), and the average hair-Hg (HHg) was 16.8\u00c2\u00b110.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/g (median: 15.7 \u00ce\u00bcg/g). There was a positive relation between fish consumption and BHg (r=0.48; P 2 =36.0%) and HHg levels (fish: \u00ce\u00b2=1.2, P 2 =21.0%). ANCOVA models showed that for the same number of fish meals, persons consuming fruits more frequently had significantly lower blood and HHg concentrations. For low fruit consumers, each fish meal contributed 9.8 \u00ce\u00bcg/ L Hg increase in blood compared to only 3.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/ L Hg increase for the high fruit consumers. In conclusion, fruit consumption may provide a protective effect for Hg exposure in Amazonian riparians. Prevention strategies that seek to maintain fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in fish-eating communities should be pursued\nInfluence of mercury bioaccessibility on exposure assessment associated with consumption of cooked predatory fish in Spain."

Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model.

Nothing changes this fact, again because decision-making is the product of complex physical processes; it is not an uncaused event.) It is generally unclear what the purpose of such models is. Are they a hypotheses we should test? They do not seem to be.

The source of this relief is the simple earlier-mentioned fact that we can never know whether there is just one or infinitely many possible outcomes from the present state of the universe. This simple fact gives us all the relief we could ask for, because it reveals that there is no reason to be sure that there is just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe. And, to repeat an important point, we are then left with the conclusion that the only reasonable thing to do is to try to make the best impact we can in the world, which is true no matter whether there is just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe or not, since our actions still have consequences and therefore still matter even in a fully deterministic universe.

Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.

This value is well matched by the modeled\nregion with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\\,\\ref{model}).

Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich\ndataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation.

The inner ``chemical'' hole observed\ntoward IRAS\\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in\nthe chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger\ncarbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion.

      "The time-varying positions of the $n$-th vehicle is given by $\\mathrm{p}_{n,t}=[{x}_{n,t},{y}_{n,t}]$ where $n \\in N$. Among the $K$ orthogonal subchannels available for the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, RSU assigns one V2I link to each vehicle. Each vehicle exchanges messages composed of the vehicle's state (i.e., position and velocity) with RSU through the $k$-th V2I link by transmitting a signal $\\textrm{x}_{t,k}$ carrying those messages at each time instant $t$ where $k \\in K$. We consider a reactive RSJ that aims to attack the V2I link by injecting intentional interference to the communication link between vehicles and RSU to alter the transmitted signals by the vehicles. In contrast, the RSS purposes to mislead the vehicles by spoofing the GPS signal and so registering wrong GPS positions. RSU aims to detect both the spoofer on the satellite link and the jammer on multiple V2I links in order to take effective actions and protect the vehicular network. The joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection problem can be formulated as the following ternary hypothesis test:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{cases}\n        \\mathcal{H}_{0}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k}, \\\\\n        \\mathcal{H}_{1}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k} + \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{JR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k}^{j} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k}, \\\\\n        \\mathcal{H}_{2}: \\mathrm{z}_{t,k} = \\mathrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{x}_{t,k}^{*} + \\mathrm{v}_{t,k},\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{0}$, $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{2}$ denote three hypotheses corresponding to the absence of both jammer and spoofer, the presence of the jammer, and the presence of the spoofer, respectively. $\\textrm{z}_{t,k}$ is the received signal at the RSU at $t$ over the $k$-th V2I link, $\\textrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR}$ is the channel power gain from vehicle $n$ to the RSU formulated as: $\\textrm{g}_{t,k}^{nR} = \\alpha_{t,k}^{nR} \\mathrm{h}_{t,k}^{nR}$, where $\\alpha_{t,k}^{nR}$ is the large-scale fading including path-loss and shadowing modeled as \\cite{8723178}: $\\alpha_{t,k}^{nR}=G\\beta d_{t,nR}^{-\\gamma}$.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]"

We refer the EHEs derivation based on kinetic equation to as KMM. The necessity of the expanded part, the evolution equations of the relevant non-conserved moments, increases rapidly as increasing the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium. As the degree of non-continuity/non-equilibrium increases, the complexity will rapidly make KMM simulation studies, deriving and solving EHE, impossible."

      "\"\nFurthermore, the absolute value constraint can be decomposed into linear constraints by the application of big-M method and the introduction of an auxiliary variable, as shown in the Appendix. Remark 3: The proposed formulation can accommodate arbitrary number of lanes at any given time instant k. This means that if at any given time, the number of available lanes for traveling either increases or decreases, the proposed formulation will still continue to hold. This is an important consideration since many a times on highways, some lanes are blocked due to various unanticipated situations such as road accidents, roadwork, narrowing of road etc. 2) Computational Complexity Reduction: This section details the optimization problem reformulation with binary variables, optimization warm start technique and lazy constraint implementation, all of which combine to improve the computational complexity of our SLAS module. Binary Variables: The proposed formulation in Section III-B has relatively high computation complexity (computation time of \u223c 2s in the worst case scenario -slow moving traffic blocking all the lanes) due to the integer decision variables yielding a mixed-integer optimization problem . To circumvent the computational overload, we reformulate the problem with binary variables that replace the integer variables, as follows:\nwhere the Lk (i, j) represents the modified target lane variable, indexed by the lane (i) as well as the planning step (j) and Lk (a, b) = 1 represents the choice of lane a \u2208 L as the target lane at planning step b \u2208 Z . Then, some of the constraints from the SLAS formulation in Section III-B are modified as follows:\nHere, initializes the target lane, (21) restricts the target lane at any planning step to the set of available lanes, restricts the lane change between consecutive planning steps to the adjacent lanes, and ( ) represents the augmented safety constraint. The implication ( =\u21d2 ) in ( ) can easily be transformed into a linear constraint (see Appendix)."

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "These vessels are operated by approximately 150 highly-specialised shark fishers, from Tanjung Luar village and Gili Maringkik, who make up roughly 5% of the local fisher population. The shark industry is more profitable than non-shark fisheries, and shark fishers report high household dependency on shark resources, low occupational diversity, and limited capacity and aspirations to move into other fisheries or industries. Surface and bottom longlines are used as the primary fishing gears to target sharks, with pelagic fish (e.g. Euthynnus spp., Rastrellinger spp.) used as bait. Surface and bottom longlines systematically vary in length, depth deployed, number of sets, number of hooks used, and soak times (Table 2). Gear types are typically associated with certain vessel types, and fishers\u2013captain and crew\u2014tend to exhibit preferences for specific gear types. Shark fishers also use gillnets and troll lines as secondary gears, to catch bait and opportunistically target other species, such as grouper, snapper, skipjack and mackerel tuna. Table 2. Characteristics of surface and bottom longlines. The shark fishing vessels can be divided into two broad categories according to fishing behaviour: larger vessels (\u226514 m) with higher horsepower (HP) engines spend more time at sea than smaller vessels (\u226412m) (p<0.001), and reach fishing grounds outside of West Nusa Tenggara. These vessels primarily fish in southern Sumbawa and Sumba Islands, however, they also reach as far as eastern Flores, Timor Island, and the Java Sea (Fig 1). Larger, higher HP vessels also tend to employ surface longlines (p<0.001), and since they spend more time at sea, have a higher number of sets per trip than smaller vessels (p<0.001). Smaller vessels (\u226412 m) with smaller engines tend to remain in waters around West Nusa Tenggara only, carrying out shorter fishing trips using bottom longlines (Table 3). Table 3. Characterisation of the different fishing vessels used to target sharks in Tanjung Luar. During the study period we recorded shark catch from a total of 595 fishing trips."

      "[37, 38]. Strengthening Indonesia\u2019s existing MPA network for shark conservation, such as making all MPAs no-take zones for sharks and expanding spatial protection to critical shark habitat, including aggregation sites or pupping and nursery grounds for species of conservation concern, could have considerable conservation benefits. It should be noted, however, that MPAs may only be effective for certain species, such as those with small ranges or site-fidelity . More research is required to identify critical shark habitat and life history stages. For Tanjung Luar these efforts could focus on better understanding scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) aggregation sites. Well-targeted spatial closures for this species could significantly reduce catch of threatened species in this fishery. The relationships between gear type, several aspects of fishing effort (i.e. hook number, engine power, number of sets, trip length), standardised CPUE of all shark species and standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species suggest that there is an optimal effort that could increase overall CPUE of the fishery and significantly reduce fishing mortality of species of conservation concern. For example, our data suggest that CPUE peaks with low to intermediate trip lengths and gear sets, intermediate engine power and hook numbers of less than 75 per set longline. Although standardised CPUE of threatened and regulated species is also higher when fewer hooks are deployed, the catch per set and overall mortality is significantly lower. Regulations that control the number of hooks in combination with incentives for shark fishers to tightly manage the number of hooks they deploy could significantly reduce mortality of threatened and endangered species, maximise the overall CPUE of the fishery, and reduce operational costs for fishers, making shark fishing in Tanjung Luar more sustainable and more cost effective [39\u201341]. Acknowledging that almost half of Tanjung Luar\u2019s shark catch consists of CITES-listed species, developing measures that ensure both the sustainability of the fishery, and full traceability and control of onward trade, will be crucial for implementing CITES ."

When most people already own a tablet, they won't be buying a new one every year and therefore sales will stagnate/decrease. The PC market is saturated and in a couple of years, the tablet market will be saturated too. Basically, in order to increase sales in a saturated market, you need to increase the population growth or decrease the longevity of the product. That's true as long as most people are still buying both a tablet and a laptop when each needs to be replaced. I think the assumption is that, as you say, the tablet market will saturate, with people just replacing existing ones, but the desktop/laptop market could decrease much farther than that, if most people stop replacing them at all. I'm not sure of the likelihood of that, but I think that's where this idea comes from. ggeezz wrote:Intel cannot abandon the phone/tablet market.

      "They are all helpful to characterize the TNE strength and describe the TNE behaviors of a fluid system from their perspectives. But it is not enough only relying on these quantities. Besides the above physical quantities describing the TNE behaviors, in DBM modeling, we can also use the non-conservative moments of ( f \u2212 f eq ) to characterize the TNE state and extract TNE information from the fluid system. Fundamentally, four TNE quantities can be defined in a firstorder DBM, i.e., \u2206 \u03c3 * 2 , \u2206 \u03c3 * 3,1 , \u2206 \u03c3 * 3 , and \u2206 \u03c3 * 4,2 . Their definitions can be seen in Table , where v * i = v i \u2212 u represents the central velocity and u is the macro flow velocity of the mixture. Physically, \u2206 \u03c3 * 2 = \u2206 \u03c3 * 2,\u03b1\u03b2 e \u03b1 e \u03b2 and \u2206 \u03c3 * 3,1 = \u2206 \u03c3 * 3,1 e \u03b1 represent the viscous stress tensor (or non-organized momentum flux, NOMF) and heat flux tensor (or non-organized energy flux, NOEF), respectively. The e \u03b1 (e \u03b2 ) is the unit vector in the \u03b1 (\u03b2 ) direction. The later two higher-order TNE quantities contain more condensed information. Specifically, and it indicates the flux information of \u2206 \u03c3 * 2 . To describe the TNE strength of the whole fluid system, some TNE quantities contained more condensed information are also defined, i.e.,\nOther TNE quantities can be defined based on specific requirements. All the independent components of TNE characteristic quantities open a highdimensional phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive image for characterizing the TNE state and understanding TNE behaviors . It should be emphasized that: (i) The TNE strength/intensity/degree is the most basic parameter of non-equilibrium flow description; And any definition of non-equilibrium strength/intensity/degree depends on the research perspective. (ii) The physical meaning of D * m,n is the TNE strength of this perspective. (iii) From a certain perspective, the TNE strength is increasing; While from a different perspective, the TNE strength, on the other hand, may be decreasing. It is normal, one of the concrete manifestations of the complexity of non-equilibrium flow behavior."

      "Generally, there are three kinds of physical modeling methods (or models) for SBI numerical research, i.e., the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic modeling methods. Most of the existing numerical researches on SBI are related to the macroscopic modeling methods (such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes (NS) models) based on the continuous hypothesis (or equilibrium and nearequilibrium hypothesis) . For example, presented the computational results on the evolution of the shock-accelerated heavy bubbles through the multi-fluid Eulerian equation . There also exist a few SBI works based on the mesoscopic modeling method, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method . The microscopic modeling methods such as the Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is capable of capturing much more flow behaviors but restricted to smaller spatiotemporal scales because of its huge computing costs. In the numerical research on SBI, three points need to be concerned. (i) Investigation of kinetic modeling that describes the non-continuity/non-equilibrium flows. Most of the current researches are based on macroscopic models. However, there exist abundant small structure (and fast-changing patterns) behaviors and effects such as the shock wave, boundary layer, material defects, etc. For cases with small structures, the mean free path of molecules cannot be ignored compared to the characteristic length, i.e., the non-continuity (discreteness) of the system is pronounced, which challenge the rationality and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the continuity hypothesis. For cases with fast-changing patterns, the system dose not have enough time to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium state, i.e., the system may significantly deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Therefore, the rational-ity and physical function of the macroscopic models based on the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium (or near thermodynamic equilibrium) will be challenged. (ii) Improvement of method that describes the evolution characteristics of bubbles and flows morphology."

    "documentation": [
      "Using this framework we are able to control the hand during different grasp types using only one variable, the grasp size, which we define as the distance between the tip of the thumb and the index finger. Instead of controlling the finger limbs independently, our controller generates control signals for all the hand joints in a (lowdimensional) shared space (i.e.\nsynergy space). In addition, our approach is modular, which allows to execute various types of precision grips, by changing the synergy space according to the type of grasp. We show that our controller is able to lift objects of various weights and materials, adjust the grasp configuration during changes in the object's weight, and perform object placements and object handovers. INTRODUCTION\n\nTo perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, humans use tactile feedback from their fingers. This feedback is provided by tactile afferents located in the skin of the hand. Particularly, for handling small objects with precise movements, the afferents located in the fingertips are used, which have high density and adapt fast to pressure changes . These afferents provide information about the characteristics of the exerted contact forces, such as the magnitude and the direction. For anthropomorphic robots to be able to perform dexterous tasks similar force feedback signals must be used to alleviate problems arising from uncertainty in measurements, and handle external perturbations. For example, using open-loop position control to lift a heavy object may fail due to slip without any feedback mechanism to provide tactile information. Previous works have used tactile sensors to design force controllers that use slip prediction to update the desired normal forces applied by the fingertips. The slip predictors are based on machine learning models such as neural networks and random forests to classify multi-modal signals from a tactile sensor. In all previous works, each finger was separately controlled by an independent force controller."

    "documentation": [
      "This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser. In practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values. It should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser. Furthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor. Concretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( \u03c6 i ) = U ( \u03c6 i ) \u2297 U * ( \u03c6 i ), with U ( \u03c6 i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by \u03c6 i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(\u2212i\u03b1(\u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z )) with angle \u03b1, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond. The resulting gate has 7 real parameters \u03c6 i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each \u03ba i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional \u03b6 i ."

      "The risk for specific individuals depends on current health status, age, and other factors. Because of the risks involved and the fact that beta thalassemia is a treatable condition, transplant physicians require a brother or sister donor who has an identically matched tissue type, called HLA type. HLA type refers to the unique set of proteins present on each individual's cells, which allows the immune system to recognize \"self\" from \"foreign.\" HLA type is genetically determined, so there is a 25% chance for two siblings to be a match. Transplant physicians and researchers are also investigating ways to improve the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation. Using newborn sibling umbilical cord blood\u2014the blood from the placenta that is otherwise discarded after birth but contains cells that can go on to make bone marrow\u2014seems to provide a safer and perhaps more effective source of donor cells. Donors and recipients may not have to be perfect HLA matches for a successful transplant using cord blood cells. Trials are also underway to determine the effectiveness of \"partial transplants,\" in which a safer transplant procedure is used to replace only a percentage of the affected individual's bone marrow. Other possible treatments on the horizon may include gene therapy techniques aimed at increasing the amount of normal hemoglobin the body is able to make. Hemoglobin H disease is a relatively mild form of thalassemia that may go unrecognized. It is not generally considered a condition that will reduce one's life expectancy. Education is an important part of managing the health of an individual with hemoglobin H disease. It is important to be able to recognize the signs of severe anemia that require medical attention. It is also important to be aware of the medications, chemicals, and other exposures to avoid due to the theoretical risk they pose of causing a severe anemia event. When severe anemia occurs, it is treated with blood transfusion therapy. For individuals with hemoglobin H disease, this is rarely required."

      "Few of them were rated at more than a few shillings and many of them were unoccupied.\u201d[1] The landowner, William, 5th Baron Craven, desiring to increase the profitability of his assets, tore down the derelict structures on Spur Alley around 1730 and leased the newly established lots to builders. By 1735, twenty brick houses in the Georgian style had been built on the west side and sixteen on the east side of the way now called Craven Street.[2] Figure 2. Craven Street 1746. (John Rocque London, Westminster and Southwark, First Edition 1746, Motco Enterprises Limited, motco.com)\nLetters to Franklin during his residence with Mrs. Margaret Stevenson, his landlady on Craven Street, were addressed rather vaguely; \u201cCraven Street/Strand\u201d, \u201cMrs. Stevensons in Craven Street\u201d, or \u201cBenjamin Franklin Esqr.\u201d are but a few examples. Letters from Franklin referenced \u201cLondon,\u201d or sometimes \u201cCravenstreet,\u201d but never included a number. Despite the absence of numbered addresses in Franklin\u2019s correspondence, there was a sense of one\u2019s place in the neighborhood based on entries in the Westminster Rate Books (tax assessments). The Rate Books did not list house numbers during Franklin\u2019s time there, but they did list the residents of Craven Street in a particular order that became the default numbering system for the street. Number one was associated with the first resident listed under \u201cCraven Street\u201d in the Rate Books and was the northernmost house on the west side of the street. The numbers increased counter-clockwise down the west side and up the east side in accordance with the list of residents. In 1748, the first year of Margaret Stevenson\u2019s (Stevens in the Rate Books for that year) residence on Craven Street, she is listed as the twenty-seventh resident, the second house north of Court Street (later Craven Court, now Craven Passage) on the east side of the street.[3]\nIn 1766, Parliament passed the London Paving and Lighting Act (6 Geo. 3 c. 26), \u201cAn act for the better paving, cleansing, and enlightening, the city of London, and the liberties thereof; and for preventing obstructions and annoyances within the same; and for other purposes therein mentioned."

      "}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:w2_spectra} shows a series of $\\omega_2$ late-signal excitation spectra for a set of initial densities. Here, we see a clear consequence of the higher-order dependence of Penning fraction - and thus the NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance - on $n_0$, the $\\omega_2$-selected Rydberg gas initial principal quantum number. This Penning-regulated NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance appears necessary as a critical factor in achieving the long ultracold plasma lifetime required to produce this signal. We are progressing in theoretical work that explains the stability apparently conferred by this balance.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Bifurcation and arrested relaxation}\n\nAmbipolar expansion quenches electron kinetic energy as the initially formed plasma expands. Core ions follow electrons into the wings of the Rydberg gas. There, recurring charge exchange between NO$^+$ ions and NO$^*$ Rydberg molecules redistributes the ambipolar force of the expanding electron gas, equalizing ion and Rydberg velocities. This momentum matching effectively channels electron energy through ion motion into the overall $\\pm x$ motion of gas volumes in the laboratory. The internal kinetic energy of the plasma, which at this point is defined almost entirely by the ion-Rydberg relative motion, falls. Spatial correlation develops, and over a period of 500 ns, the system forms the plasma/high-Rydberg quasi-equilibrium dramatically evidenced by the SFI results in Figure \\ref{fig:SFI}. \\begin{figure}[h!] \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= .4 \\textwidth]{Bifurcation.pdf}\n   \\caption{$x,y$ detector images of ultracold plasma volumes produced by 2:1 aspect ratio ellipsoidal Rydberg gases with selected initial state, $40f(2)$ after a flight time of 402 $\\mu$s over a distance of 575 mm.

    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh. A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals. The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494\u201398 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points."

    "documentation": [
      "Compared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful. Because the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Response calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, \u1e8f) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), \u1e8f(t) and \u00ff(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation. If the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (\u03c4 ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (\u03c4 1 , . ."

      "In other words, as the robot continually moves in space, the first hyperplane that it will cross upon exiting the polytope will correspond to one of the polytope's nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager outline an iterative method for removing redundant constraints by solving n linear programs. We use this method in practice for computing \u03b1 j e for each polytope. We can now characterize each polytope by a vector \u03b1 j e \u2208 {\u22121, 1} n j e , where n j e \u2264 n is the number of essential constraints of the polytope. The polytopes P j partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement. Path Preference\n\nIn this section, we provide a definition of preference \u03b8 according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition. Let G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector \u03b1 j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane). Let N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m \u03b8 = v\u2208V |N (v)| be the cardinality of \u0398, and m g = |\u2126 g | the number of possible goals. A priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m \u03b8 \u00d7 m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent."

By the exponential decay property of the kernel K stated in Lemma 2 holds First, H(f ) \u221e is bounded with the maximum over a finite number of points. Calculating the derivative of s : Since \u03b4 \u03b4x s(x) > 0 almost surely for x = x k , the extrema occur at x k , k = 1, ..., T . Thus, for \u03bb > 0 the moment generating function of H(f ) \u221e is bounded by\nLet M j = ( T h) \u22121 T k=1 \u03b3 h (x j , x k ), which by Lemma 2 is bounded uniformly in j by some global constant M > 0. By the convexity of the exponential function we obtain \u221a 2 and by assumption 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 f \u2264 M 0 .

In particular, To derive the asymptotic order of E[exp{\u03bb H(f ) \u221e }] for n, p \u2192 \u221e we first establish the asymptotic order of the ratio \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nWe distinguish the two cases where t is independent of a and where t linearly depends on a. Thus, for 0 < t < a and t independent of a, equation (A.17) implies for a \u2192 \u221e that \u0393(a + t)/\u0393(a) = O(a t ). Similarly, it can be seen that \u0393(a \u2212 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u2212t ). If 0 < t < a and t linearly depends on a, i.e. t = ca for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1), then we get \u0393(a \u00b1 t)/\u0393(a) = O(a \u00b1t exp{a}) for a \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, for a fixed \u03bb not depending on n, p and such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ) we get for sufficiently large n, p If \u03bb = cm such that 0 < \u03bb < m/( \u221a 2M j ), then for sufficiently large n, p b\u2208{c\u03b4/m,cM 0 /m} (bm/2) for some constant L > 1.

Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command. Early life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918.

The latter is affected by velocity gradient and the NOMF (\u2206 * 2 ). The entropy production rates are defined by the following formulas : Integrating the \u1e60NOEF and \u1e60NOMF over time t, the entropy generations over this period of time are obtained, i.e., S NOEF = t 0 \u1e60NOEF dt and S NOMF = t 0 \u1e60NOMF dt. Plotted in Fig. ) and 14(b) are the temporal evolution of \u1e60NOMF and \u1e60NOEF , respectively. The evolution of entropy generation rate is related to two aspects: (i) the propagation of the shock wave, and (ii) the deformation of the bubble. The former generates a macroscopic quantity gradient, and the latter makes the contact interface wider, longer, and deformed. Depending on the location of the shock wavefront, there exist two critical moments in this SBI process: (i) at around t = 0.03, the shock wave just sweeps through the bubble, and (ii) at t = 0.06, the shock wave exits the flow field. Therefore, the temporal evolution of the entropy production rate shows three stages, i.e., t < 0.03, 0.03 < t < 0.06, and t > 0.06. At the stage t < 0.03, the shock compression stage, the shock effects compress the bubble. It generates the large macroscopic quantity gradients, resulting in a quick increase of \u1e60NOMF . At around t = 0.03, the shock wave passed through the bubble. So the values of \u1e60NOMF decreases. The values of \u1e60NOMF would continue to decrease due to the gradually wider contact interface caused by the diffusion effect. At around t = 0.06, the shock wave comes out of the flow field so that the values of \u1e60NOMF drops rapidly. In the third stage, i.e., t > 0.06, because of the diffusive effect, the general trend of \u1e60NOMF is downward. However, it shows an oscillatory trend due to the influence of various reflected shock waves. The specific heat ratio indirectly changes the value of \u1e60NOMF by changing the velocity gradient. The smaller the specific-heat ratio, the larger \u1e60NOMF . Different understanding can be seen in Fig. , where the temporal evolution of \u1e60NOEF is plotted."

      "\\section{Introduction}\\label{S1}\n\nThe multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user\nlimitation in CDMA systems \\cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean\nsquare-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method\nis a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)\nreceivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this\nmethod and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \\cite{R5}\n(see also \\cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is\nsubtracted before making the decision for a specific user in\ndifferent stages \\cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity. Unlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC. In each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \\ref{S4}\nthe modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase\nestimation is introduced. In section \\ref{S5} some simulation\nexamples illustrate the results of the proposed method."

      "(1) Physical modelling, (2) Algorithm design, (3) Numerical experiments and analysis of complex physical fields. The research of equation algorithm corresponds to the part (2) of the above three parts. The DBM aims at parts (1) and (3) of the three mentioned above. It belongs to a physical model construction method rather than a numerical solution for the equations. The tasks of DBM are to: (i) Ensure the rationality of the physical model (theoretical model) and balance the simplicity for the problem to be studied; (ii) Try to extract more valuable physical information from massive data and complex physical fields. Based on the coarse-grained modeling method of nonequilibrium statistical physics, the DBM aims to solve the following dilemma: (i) The traditional hydrodynamic modelings are based on the continuous hypothesis (or near-equilibrium hypothesis). They only concern the evolution of three conserved kinetic moments of the distribution function, i.e. the density, momentum and energy, so their physical functions are insufficient. (ii) The situation that the MD can be used is restricted to too small spatial-temporal scales. The physical requirement for the modeling is that except for the Hydrodynamic Non-Equilibriums (HNE), the most related TNE are also needed to be captured. Theoretically, the Boltzmann equation is suitable for all-regime flows, including the continuum regime, slip regime, transition regime, and free molecule flow regime. Based on the Chapman-Enskog (CE) multiscale analysis , through retaining various orders of Kn number (or considering different orders of TNE effects), the Boltzmann equation can be reduced to the various orders of hydrodynamic equations. They can be used to describe the hydrodynamic behaviors, i.e., the conservations of mass, momentum and energy , in corresponding flow regimes. Because what the traditional hydrodynamic equations describe are only the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. Consequently, it should be pointed out that, the information lost in the traditional hydrodynamic equations increases sharply with increasing the Kn number."

      "Scientists continue to study the causes. For instance, a new mutation for alpha-thalassemia was discovered for the first time among Iranian patients in 2004. BETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two normal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located on chromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There are approximately 100 genetic mutations that have been described that cause beta thalassemia, designated as either beta0 or beta + mutations. No beta globin is produced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction of the normal amount of beta globin is produced with a beta + mutation. When an individual has one normal beta globin gene and one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she is said to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemia trait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective against malaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not to cause health problems, although some women with beta thalassemia trait may have an increased tendency toward anemia during pregnancy. When two members of a couple carry the beta thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of their children will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inheriting two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each parent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia disease\u2014whether an individual has beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major\u2014will depend largely on whether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia or beta + thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ thalassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemia intermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta + thalassemia mutation tends to be less predictable. Although relatively uncommon, there are other thalassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globin gene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of a single nucleotide. This change results in a structurally altered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased amounts."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nUltracold neutral plasmas studied in the laboratory offer access to a regime of plasma physics that scales to describe thermodynamic aspects of important high-energy-density systems, including strongly coupled astrophysical plasmas \\cite{VanHorn,Burrows}, as well as terrestrial sources of neutrons \\cite{Hinton,Ichimaru_fusion,Atzeni,Boozer} and x-ray radiation \\cite{Rousse,Esarey}. Yet, under certain conditions, low-temperature laboratory plasmas evolve with dynamics that are governed by the quantum mechanical properties of their constituent particles, and in some cases by coherence with an external electromagnetic field. The relevance of ultracold plasmas to such a broad scope of problems in classical and quantum many-body physics has given rise to a great deal of experimental and theoretical research on these systems since their discovery in the late 90s. A series of reviews affords a good overview of progress in the last twenty years \\cite{Gallagher,Killian_Science,PhysRept,Lyon}. Here, we focus on the subset of ultracold neutral plasmas that form via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases, and emphasize in particular the distinctive dynamics found in the evolution of molecular ultracold plasmas. While molecular beam investigations of threshold photoionization spectroscopy had uncovered relevant effects a few years earlier \\cite{Scherzer,Alt}, the field of ultracold plasma physics began in earnest with the 1999 experiment of Rolston and coworkers on metastable xenon atoms cooled in a magneto optical trap (MOT) \\cite{Killian}. This work and many subsequent efforts tuned the photoionization energy as a means to form a plasma of very low electron temperature built on a strongly coupled cloud of ultracold ions. Experiment and theory soon established that fast processes associated with disorder-induced heating and longer-time electron-ion collisional rate processes act to elevate the ion temperatures to around one degree Kelvin, and constrain the effective initial electron temperature to a range above 30 K \\cite{Kuzmin,Hanson,Laha}."

      "The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents. Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way. Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors."

Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with \u2206t = 10 \u22124 . For Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution. When the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases. In each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero. This may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27."

      "Survivors passed the mutation onto their offspring, and the trait became established throughout areas where malaria is common. As populations migrated, so did the thalassemia traits. Beta thalassemia trait is seen most commonly in people with the following ancestry: Mediterranean (including North African, and particularly Italian and Greek), Middle Eastern, Indian, African, Chinese, and Southeast Asian (including Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Cambodian, Malaysian, Burmese, and Indonesian). Alpha-thalassemia trait is seen with increased frequency in the same ethnic groups. However, there are different types of alpha thalassemia traits within these populations. The frequency of hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major depends on the type of alpha thalassemia trait. The populations in which alpha thalassemia diseases are most common include Southeast Asians and Chinese (particularly Southern Chinese). It is difficult to obtain accurate prevalence figures for various types of thalassemia within different populations. This difficulty arises due to testing limitations in determining exact genetic diagnoses, as well as the fact that many studies have focused on small, biased hospital populations. Two studies reflect prevalence figures that can be helpful counseling families and determining who to screen for beta thalassemia. Between the years of 1990 and 1996, the State of California screened more than 3.1 million infants born in the state for beta thalassemia. Approximately 1 in 114,000 infants had beta thalassemia major, with prevalence rates being highest among Asian Indians (about one in 4,000), Southeast Asians (about one in 10,000), and Middle Easterners (about one in 7,000). Another type of beta thalassemia disease, E/beta thalassemia, was represented in approximately one in 110,000 births, all of which occurred in families of Southeast Asian ancestry. Among Southeast Asians, the prevalence of E/beta thalassemia was approximately one in 2,600 births. This is in keeping with the observation that hemoglobin E trait carrier rates are relatively high within the Southeast Asian population: 16% in a study of 768 immigrants to California, and up to 25% in some specific Southeast Asian populations such as Cambodians."

The potential for gypsy moth outbreak exists every year in our community. Dr. Kirby Stafford III, head of the Department of Entomology at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, has written a fact sheet on the gypsy moth available on the CAES website. The following information is from this fact sheet. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, was introduced into the US (Massachusetts) by Etienne Leopold Trouvelot in about 1860. The escaped larvae led to small outbreaks in the area in 1882, increasing rapidly. It was first detected in Connecticut in 1905. By 1952, it had spread to 169 towns. In 1981, 1.5 million acres were defoliated in Connecticut."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C)",
    "documentation": [
      "All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(\u03b7 g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. \u03b3 = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables \u00d4 p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere \u03b3 = N G g=1 \u03b3 g is the overall sampling overhead, with \u03b3 g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large \u03b3 implies a large variance of \u00d4 p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate \u00d4 p=0 with error \u03b4 at probability 1 \u2212 \u03c9 is bounded by (2\u03b3 2 /\u03b4 2 ) ln(2/\u03c9) . Since \u03b3 scales exponentially in \u03b3 g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and \u03b3 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with \u03b3 > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to \u03b3 = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser. Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize \u03b3 to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps. This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the \u03b7 i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Our control algorithm could also be applied to different hands as it does not depend on the hands configuration. Finally, in previous approaches only lifting tasks had been considered. In our work we demonstrate that our approach can be used to perform more complex tasks, such as placing objects on surfaces and performing handovers, which was not done in previous works. Our goal in this work is to design a control algorithm for an anthropomorphic robotic hand to perform dexterous manipulation skills such as lifting and placing down objects. Our control algorithm will use tactile feedback from the force sensors on the fingertips of the hand to decide the forces that need to be applied to the object in each step of the task. Given the desired forces to be applied, the size of the grasp will be computed. Given the grasp size and a desired grasp type, the posture generator will generate a grasp posture, i.e. the hand configuration, such that the force constraints are satisfied. To model the contacts and friction we use Coulombs' law, which states that in order to avoid slip, the normal contact force f n to the contact surface of an object, times the fiction coefficient \u00b5, has to be larger than the tangential force f t :\n\u00b5f n \u2265 f t You can see an example in Figure , where an object is pressed against a wall by an applied normal force f n , and we have the tangential force f t = mg due to gravity. In order for the object to remain stable we need to apply a normal force: where \u00b5 is the friction coefficient between the object and the wall. In the case of a dexterous hand manipulating an object, we want the normal forces applied by all fingers to be greater than the tangential force divided by the friction coefficient of the materials of the object and the fingertip. Since it is hard to accurately compute the friction coefficient between all possible object materials previous works have used multi-modal tactile sensors like the BioTac sensor, which provides information about the pressure, skin deformation, and temperature, to predict slip and based on that signal to increase the applied normal force."

      "In reality, constant American pressure was applied to Maliki, Allawi, Kurdish leaders and other prominent Iraqi politicians throughout the entire nine-month process to form a cabinet. The US intervention included numerous personal phone calls and visits to Baghdad by both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. The key objective of the Obama administration has been to ensure that the next Iraqi government will \"request\" a long-term military partnership with the US when the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) expires at the end of 2011. The SOFA is the legal basis upon which some 50,000 American troops remain in Iraq, operating from large strategic air bases such as Balad and Tallil and Al Asad. US imperialism spent billions of dollars establishing these advanced bases as part of its wider strategic plans and has no intention of abandoning them. Cogan's only the second person to include the SOFA in his report. Some are impressed with the 'feat' of taking nearly ten months to form a government, stringing the country along for ten months while no decisions could go through.

The Tehran Times reports that Danaiifar was full of praise today hailing the \"positive and final step which ended the 10-month political limbo in Iraq.\" However, Danaiifar was less pie-in-the-sky than the Post editorial board because he can foresee future problems as evidenced by his statement, \"We may witness the emergence of some problems after one and half of a year -- for example, some ministers may be impeached.\" Of course, there are already many clouds on the horizon, even if Iranian diplomats and Post editorial boards can't suss them out. For example, Ben Bendig (Epoch Times) noted the objection of Iraq's female politicians to Nouri al-Maliki's decision to nominate only one woman (so far) to his Cabinet: \"Some 50 female lawmakers went to the country's top leadership, the United Nations and the Arab League to voice their concern and desire for increased representation.\""

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "We use Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) to remove motion artifacts and noises \\cite{lee07}. We first segment the PPG signal on periodic boundaries and then average the $m^{th}$ samples of each period. After filtering the input PPG signal with a 5-Hz $8^{th}$-order Butterworth low-pass filter, we estimate the maximum and minimum value of each period. The mean of each period are obtained from the maximum and minimum values applying the zero crossing method. These points of the means help determine the boundaries of each period. Then, interpolation or decimation is performed to ensure that each period had the same number of samples \\cite{lee07}. \\subsubsection{Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability Estimation} We first apply PMAF on PPG signal to remove noises and motion artifacts, refine PPG by smoothing the signal using 1-dimensional Gaussian Filter and Convolution, calculate first derivative of the convoluted signal and finally find the differences between two consecutive peak values which is called HRV \\cite{sel08}. The occurrences of total peak values (R-peak or beat) in each minute is called Heart Rate (HR) with an unit of Beat Per Minute. The signal value property of HRV and HR are inversely proportional which means the mental arousal that increases HR should decrease HRV in the time segment window. Fig~\\ref{fig:ppg_artifact_removal} shows a sample of the noisy and filtered PPG signal and their corresponding Instant Heart Rate. \\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\vspace{-.1in}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=ppg_artifact_removal.pdf,height=1.4in, width=3.5in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Top figure illustrates the noisy signal (dotted line) and filtered signal from PPG sensor based on our filtering method.

      "A group of veterans under the leadership of Veterans for Peace members Tarak Kauff, Will Covert and Elaine Brower, mother of a Marine who has served three tours of duty in Iraq, sponsored the event with the explicit purpose of putting their bodies on the line. Many participants were Vietnam War veterans; others ranged from Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans in their 20s and 30s to World War II vets in their 80s and older. They were predominately white; men outnumbered women by at least three to one. After a short rally in Lafayette Park, they formed a single-file procession, walking across Pennsylvania Avenue to the solemn beat of a drum. As they reached the police barricade (erected to prevent them from chaining themselves to the gate, a plan they announced on their web site), the activists stood shoulder to shoulder, their bodies forming a human link across the 'picture postcard' tableau in front of the White House.\" Maria Chutchian (Arlington Advocate) quotes, participant Nate Goldshlag (Vietnam veteran) stating, \"\"There was a silent, single file march around Lafayette Park to a drum beat. Then we went in front of the White House,. There were barricades set up in front of white house fence. So when we got there, we jumped over barricades and were able to get right next to the White House fence.\" Participant Linda LeTendre (Daily Gazette) reports: At the end of the rally, before the silent, solemn procession to the White House fence, in honor of those killed in Iraq and Afghan wars of lies and deceptions, the VFP played taps and folded an American flag that had been left behind at a recent funeral for the veteran of one of those wars. Two attendees in full dress uniform held and folded the flag. I had the image of all of the people who stood along the roads and bridges when the bodies of the two local men, Benjamin Osborn and David Miller, were returned to the Capital District. I thought if all of those people were here now or spoke out against war these two fine young men might still be with us."

All this discussion about the water issue has only reinforced my opinion the issue hasn\u2019t been about water, only how the plan should be paid for. Or more specifically, to what extent do we allow our elected custodians and our un-elected GOD tzar decide which laws they will follow and which laws they will ignore. When the City GOD tzar tell citizens at a council meeting if we don\u2019t agree with the City\u2019s plan, then we should just sue him, and when the City Attorney explains to a citizen at a City Council meeting that she does have to respond to their questions because she does NOT work for them. When the project is voted down by the citizens and the council brings it right back up, it is clear that our elected representatives are not doing their job providing direction to their employees and listening to and representing the CITIZENS. The subject of the original post was the need to elect different representation. I think with all the conversation made on this post, as well as the post on Cal Coast about the hiring of the new legal firm you were involved in, Supports my original opinion."

      "Still he bolted from the bed, darting around the small frame-wood room as wildly as a trapped insect beating against glass. Two soldiers ran into the ward, pinning L to his bed, tying restraints around his wrists and elbows. .. Warner sponged his body with iced whiskey and water. She recorded his temperature, which had held at 104 degrees for days, on the chart beside his bed. .. (Warner watched him sleep.) But the quiet did not last. L's body began to lurch, and black vomit rolled from his mouth; through the bar hanging above his hospital cot. He writhed in the bed, and his skin grew deep yellow. His 104 temperature slowly fell, leveling out 99 degrees, and JL died at 8:45 p.m. at the age of thirty-four.\" As is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing. Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk. Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs."

      "Indeed, only four ('stablecoin\", \"scrypt\", \"fantom-ecosystem\" and \"alameda-research-portfolio\") out of the fifty groupings have both distributions indistinguishable under a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p-value > 0.05). Focusing now on the evolution of the power-law exponents quantified by the time series \u03b1 t for positive and negative returns, we ask whether these exponents present particular time trends. For Bitcoin [Fig. )], \u03b1 t seems to increase with time for both positive and negative returns. At the same time, the results of Fig. also suggest that market capitalization affects these power-law exponents. To verify these possibilities, we assume the power-law exponents (\u03b1 t ) to be linearly associated with the cryptocurrency's age (y t , measured in years) and the logarithm of market capitalization (log c t ). As detailed in the Methods section, we frame this problem using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This approach assumes that the linear coefficients associated with the effects of age (A) and market capitalization (C) of each digital currency are drawn from distributions with means \u00b5 A and \u00b5 C and standard deviations \u03c3 A and \u03c3 C , which are in turn distributed according to global distributions representing the overall impact of these quantities on the cryptocurrency market. The Bayesian inference process consists of estimating the posterior probability distributions of the linear coefficients for each cryptocurrency as well as the posterior distributions of \u00b5 A , \u00b5 C , \u03c3 A , and \u03c3 C , allowing us to simultaneously probe asset-specific tendencies and overall market characteristics. Moreover, we restrict this analysis to the 2140 digital currencies having more than 50 observations of market capitalization concomitantly to the time series of the power-law exponents in order to have enough data points for detecting possible trends. When considering the overall market characteristics, we find that the 94% highest density intervals for \u00b5 A ([-0.01, 0.06] for positive and [-0.02, 0.03] for negative returns) and \u00b5 C ([-0.02, 0.03] for positive and [-0.001, 0.04] for negative returns) include the zero (see Supplementary Figure for their distributions)."

      "D) The conduction gap is strongly $\\theta$-dependent, and its peaks occur at $\\theta = 0$ or $90^\\circ$, regardless of the strain direction."

      "Hence, the data obtained for $\\phi$ ranging from $-30^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$ and $\\theta  \\in \\left[ {0^\\circ ,180^\\circ } \\right]$ covers the properties of conduction gap in all possible cases. In Fig. 5, we present the maps of conduction gap with respect to the strain and its applied direction in two particular cases: the transport is either along the armchair ($\\phi = 0$) or the zigzag ($\\phi = 30^\\circ$) directions. Both tensile and compressive strains are considered. Let us first discuss the results obtained in the armchair case. Figs. 5(a,b) show that (i) a large conduction gap up to about 500 meV can open with a strain of 6 $\\%$ and (ii) again the conduction gap is strongly $\\theta$-dependent, in particular, its peaks occur at $\\theta = 0$ or $90^\\circ$ while the gap is zero at $\\theta \\approx 47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\\theta \\approx 43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain. In principle, the conduction gap is larger if the shift of Dirac points in the $\\kappa_y$-axis is larger, as discussed above about Figs. 3-4. We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac points of graphene \\cite{kitt12} and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same $\\kappa_y$ in the two graphene sections. From Eq. (9), we find that the Dirac points are determined by the following equations:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n  {\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} & =& \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{{t_1}{t_2}}}}, \\\\\n  \\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} &=& \\frac{{{t_1} + {t_2}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\cos \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\\,\\,\\,\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_x}}{2} = \\frac{{{t_2} - {t_1}}}{{\\left| {{t_3}} \\right|}}\\sin \\frac{{\\kappa_y}}{2},\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhich simplify into ${\\cos}\\frac{\\kappa_y}{2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ and, respectively, $\\cos \\left( {\\frac{{{\\kappa _x}}}{2}} \\right) = \\mp 1$ in the unstrained case. Hence, the zero conduction gap is obtained if\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \\right)}^2}}}{{4{t_1}{t_2}}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{equation*}\nAdditionally, it is observed that the effects of a strain $\\{\\sigma,\\theta\\}$ are qualitatively similar to those of a strain $\\{-\\sigma,\\theta+90^\\circ\\}$, i.e., the peaks and zero values of conduction gap are obtained at the same $\\theta$ in these two situations."

      "Strictly speaking, those TNE intensity and effect descriptions that do not account for the research perspective are not correct. Do not explain the research perspective, the corresponding is not dependent on the research perspective. Numerical simulations and results\n\nIn this section, we first validate the DBM code by comparing the DBM results with experimental results. Then, the effects of specific-heat ratio on the dynamic process and TNE behaviors on SBI are investigated. Comparison with experimental results\n\nIn the following part, we use a first-order two-fluid DBM to simulate the interaction between a planar shock wave with a 2-D heavy-cylindrical bubbles, and compare the DBM results with the experimental results from Ref. . The computational configuration can be seen in Fig. . In a flow field which is filled with Air, there is a static bubble composed of 26% Air and 74% SF 6 . A shock with Ma = 1.2 would pass through the bubble from left to right. The initial conditions of ambient gas are \u03c1 0 = 1.29kg/m 3 , T 0 = 293K, p 0 = 101.3kPa. Ignoring the pressure difference between interior gas and ambient gas, the initial parameters of the bubble are \u03c1 bubble = 4.859kg/m 3 , p bubble = 101.3kPa,\nand T 0 = 293K. For simulating, these actual physical quantities should be transferred to dimensionless parameters. This process can refer to the Appendix A. The dimensionless conditions of macroscopic quantities of the fluid field in initial time are (\u03c1, T, u x , u y ) bubble = (4.0347, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (\u03c1, T, u x , u y ) 1 = (1.3416,\n1.128, 0.3616, 0.0), (\u03c1, T, u x , u y ) 0 = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), where the subscript \"0\" (\"1\") represents downstream (upstream) region. In two-fluid DBM code, the distribution function f Air is used to describe the ambient gas, i.e., Air. The f bubble characters the bubble which is a mixture that composed of Air and SF 6 . The grid number is N x \u00d7 N y = 800 \u00d7 400, where the N x and N y are grid number in x and y direction, respectively. This grid size has passed the mesh convergence test."

      "It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo. Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother. Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village. Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school. Themes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt. The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government."

    "documentation": [
      "The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching regulated species were month (January was significantly lower: p<0.001), number of hooks (p<0.001) and engine power (<0.01). Significant factors associated with standardised CPUE of regulated species were number of hooks (p<0.001), fishing gear (<0.001), number of sets (p<0.001), engine power (p<0.01) and month (November and January: p<0.05) (Table 5 and Fig 4). Plots of most significant factors affecting standardised CPUE (number of individuals per 100 hooks per set) of regulated species: a) hook number, b) gear type, c) number of sets. Although Tanjung Luar\u2019s targeted shark fishery is small in scale, considerable numbers of shark are landed, including a large proportion of threatened and regulated species. A key finding is that measures of CPUE, for all sharks and for threatened and regulated species, vary spatially and temporally, and with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power and number of sets. Moreover, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behaviour variables are different for different measures of CPUE (CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, CPUE per 100 hooks per set). This highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types, and has important implications for fisheries management. Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January. This is during the west monsoon season, which is characterised by high rainfall and adverse conditions at sea for fishing. Unstandardised CPUE was also significantly lower in West Nusa Tenggara Province (WNTP) than East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) and other provinces, suggesting a lower abundance of sharks in this area. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE, and was also associated with longer trips and more sets, which was likely due to the ability of vessels with larger engines to travel longer distances, over longer time periods, and with higher numbers of sets, to favoured fishing grounds."

      "In order to make it presentable, I have a few more steps I go through, and these typically take me a week all by themselves. My goal is to make the sermon sound as natural and engaging as possible. First, I read the sermon out loud and mark anything that doesn\u2019t sound like me. Maybe I was copying someone\u2019s tone, or more likely my tone was too formal or too informal for the moment. I also italicize the words I want to emphasize. It\u2019s all about the sound. Second, I memorize the sermon. (Yes, the whole thing.) This is what they trained us to do in seminary, and I thought it was overkill. Yes, you can get better eye contact, step away from the podium, I get that. But what I\u2019ve discovered is that when I memorize my work it polishes the sermon like nothing else. If I can\u2019t remember what I\u2019m about to say, how can I expect the congregation to remember? Memorizing forces me to find the best words for the job. It also helps me on a structural level, because if I can\u2019t remember what I was about to say next, it shows that there\u2019s a weak connection between the two points. In a compelling script, the next thing has to follow the last. Once you know why the two are married, you can go back and make it more obvious to the congregation. As I memorize, I boil down the transcript into a preaching outline, which has just enough structure and content to cue me if my mind goes blank in the pulpit. It will have the necessary structural elements, markers for key phrases, and all condensed so that it fits on just a few pages on the platform. (One danger is if I don\u2019t use it in practice, it\u2019s less helpful on Sunday.) Third\u2014and frankly this is the step I\u2019m most likely to skip\u2014I try to choreograph my movements. I believe good preaching is theater, but not in the sense that you\u2019re dramatizing the text. Your whole body is communicating whether you want it to or not, so your gestures should be purposeful. Use the space to organize thoughts, repeat certain motions when you repeat the same thought, make sure you\u2019re not sending mixed signals."

I do think a program like BC is probably more patient with players than some of the bigger programs. We won't rush a guy out of the program to free up a scholarship. We prefer to redshirt. And I think the nature of a program -- with good academic support and less of a big school mentality -- keeps kids from falling through the cracks. Every recruit thinks they are going to be a star, so selling them on development and a safety net doesn't sway many, but it should. If anything BC should use a guy like Marcus Grant -- a local kid who left a Big Ten program to come \"home\" as an example to Massachusetts recruits. Massachusetts kids keep leaving to play at the \"highest level.\" Our counter should be that we will develop them for life and the NFL (the real highest level) and not chew them up and spit them out like a football factory. I am sure that there will be a guy in the near future who decommits from BC and becomes a star. Or a guy we should have had who leads another team to glory. Right now I am just glad that we have very few regrets when it comes to old recruits. Our recruiting still has major challenges, but that's one area where things have broken our way.

The case n = 1 corresponds to a single observation of a stationary time series, and in this case the data are simply denoted by Y \u223cN p (0 p , \u03a3). The dimension p is assumed to grow.

Moreover, the decay of the autocovariance \u03c3 k is directly connected to the smoothness of f . Finally, the convergence rate of a Toeplitz covariance estimator and that of the corresponding spectral density estimator are directly related via \u03a3 \u2264 f \u221e := sup x\u2208 |f (x)|, where \u2022 denotes the spectral norm (see .

      "Paper Info\n\nTitle: SLAS: Speed and Lane Advisory System for Highway Navigation\nPublish Date: Unkown\nAuthor List: Faizan Tariq, David Isele, John Baras, Sangjae Bae\n\nFigure\n\nFig. 1.Motivational Example. With a slow moving vehicle ahead, the ego vehicle (in blue) may decide to either change lane to the fast moving lane (left) to minimize travel time or adjust its speed without changing lanes to preserve safety but it would be unwise for it to switch to the slow moving lane (right) as that would not benefit travel time or safety.\nFig. 3. Simulation Setup.Scenario Runner sets up the scenario for the CARLA Simulator, which then communicates with the SLAS and the Planning and Control ROS (Robot Operating System) nodes through the ROS bridge node. Fig. 4. Testing scenario with three lanes: lane 0 (left), lane 1 (center) and lane 2 (right).The expected motion of the ego vehicle, over the course of the simulation, is shown with numbered frames. The right most lane (lane 3) is reserved for merging traffic so it is not utilized in our simulation. Fig. 5. Left: Travel time comparison. Center: Lane choice (lateral position) comparison. The center lines of lanes 0 (left), 1 (center) and 2 (right) have fixed lateral displacements of 0m, 3.5m and 7m respectively. Right: Headway comparison. With no leading vehicle, the headway is restricted by the visibility range of 50m.\n\nabstract\n\nThis paper proposes a hierarchical autonomous vehicle navigation architecture, composed of a high-level speed and lane advisory system (SLAS) coupled with low-level trajectory generation and trajectory following modules. Specifically, we target a multi-lane highway driving scenario where an autonomous ego vehicle navigates in traffic. We propose a novel receding horizon mixed-integer optimization based method for SLAS with the objective to minimize travel time while accounting for passenger comfort. We further incorporate various modifications in the proposed approach to improve the overall computational efficiency and achieve real-time performance."

      "The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. Moreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. It can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD. A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation. Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}. \\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}. Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature. More accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding} [see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange [\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)]."

    "correct_answer": "A)",
    "documentation": [
      "The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus \u03b1. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8. We consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8. For simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead \u03b3, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the \u03b7 i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text. In Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large \u03b3 and other times with small \u03b3. This could be related to the difference in \u03b1 distributions from Fig. . The large fluctuations of \u03b3 appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In Fig. we show Z dw for the circuits from Fig."

      "This question veritably answers itself. Only a madman would deny the evidence of his own senses. It is essential to understand that the correspondence of which I speak depends on the reality of motion [from which we derive the ideas of time and space]. To keep ourselves safe, it is necessary that we have the ability to know when a material object is moving closer or further from us and to be able to recognize an object as a danger. This, the senses give us, for perceptions like all other experiences are memories [are preserved over time]. An object is recognized as a danger through prior sensory experiences preserved as long-term memories. In order to be recognized and remembered as a danger, a material object must have the power to produce a particular human experience of it. That power is part of the nature of the object and is thus truly reflected in the perception of it\u2014even though there may be more to the object than its power to yield a human perception. To the reasonable mind, the above comments may properly be seen as statements of the obvious. The curious fact, however, is that a whole school of western philosophy has labored mightily to deny the obvious. I agree; I'm only delving into the inner experience to see how it works and what may become of that.\nby TheVat on April 22nd, 2018, 11:57 am\nRJG, this tablet ate the quoted part of your post and somehow hid the submit button, so sorry about the missing comment.... No, I was not assuming the in-the-moment knowledge, but rather that facts about buses are physically verifiable when science is applied. It is not difficult to verify that I was neither dreaming nor hallucinating. We are saved from solipsism by the multiplicity of observers and their reports. We can open a book and read complex prose (something that can't be done in dreams) that reveals areas of knowledge utterly unknown to us and beyond our previous experiences. We have senses enhanced by instruments that can show us photons leaving the photosphere of the sun and bouncing off solid objects like buses in particular and regular patterns, etc."

      "Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space. Hyperplane Arrangement\n\nWe assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i \u2208 R di\u00d72 and b i \u2208 R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.\n.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where \u03b1 j i \u2208 {\u22121, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i .

We spatially decompose the preference \u03b8 into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j). We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and \u03b1 j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and \u03b1 j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope."

      "Libertarians do not necessarily accept that this argument shows that we do not have free will, and the reason, or at least a big part of it, should not surprise anyone at this point: they simply define free will differently. According to libertarians, such as Robert Nozick and Robert Kane, one has free will if one could have acted otherwise than one did, and if indeterminism is true, then it may be true that we could have \u201cacted\u201d differently than we did under the exact same circumstances, and that we thereby might have free will in this sense. It should be pointed out, though, that critics of libertarianism are\u201crightly skeptical about the relevance of this kind of free will. First of all, the free will that libertarians endorse is, unlike what many libertarians seem to think, not an ethically relevant kind of freedom, and it does not have anything to do with the freedom of action that we by definition want. Second, the hard incompatibilist is right that no matter what is true about the degree to which the universe is deterministic, our actions are still caused by prior causes ultimately beyond our own control, which few of those who identify themselves as libertarians seem to want to acknowledge. And lastly, the fact that our actions are caused by causes ultimately beyond our own control does, if we truly appreciated, undermine our intuition of retributive justice, an intuition that libertarians generally seem to want to defend intellectually. So, as many have pointed out already, libertarians are simply on a failed mission. Together with the want to defend retributive blame and punishment, what seems to be the main motivation for people who defend a libertarian notion of free will seems to be a fear of predeterminism, a fear of there being just one possible outcome from the present state of the universe, which would imply that we ultimately cannot do anything to cause a different outcome than the one possible. Libertarians and others with the same fear have artfully tried to make various models to help them overcome this fear, for instance so-called two-stage models that propose that our choices consist of an indeterministic stage of generation of possible actions, and then our non-random choice of one of them."

By accounting for path preferences in its model, the blue robot's entropy over the goal distribution decreases more steadily, allowing for it to leverage the human's latest observations and reach the goal successfully. shows an over-confident prediction (shown by the strong reduction in belief entropy) that the correct goal is less likely, making it more difficult to reach the correct goal compared to a method that accounts for path preference. Computation time. In table II we provide the time required to solve the POMDP, and the time required to update the robot's belief as it receives new observations. We compute solutions on three maps: a simple 10 \u00d7 10 grid world with 8 polytopes (fig. ), a 10 \u00d7 10 grid world with 56 polytopes (fig. ), and a 20\u00d720 grid world with 73 polytopes (fig. ). The latter environment being larger, we increase the mission time and the depth of the search tree in POMCP from T max = 30 (Map 1 and Map 2) to T max = 60 (Map 3)."

      "We have no\ninformation over the 12 days between the data point of maximum\nbrightness and the lower limit prior to this (Fig.\\,\\ref{optlc}), and\ntherefore we have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent\nmagnitude at outburst. Assuming for the moment though that we have\ncaught the outburst exactly in the Sep.~30, 2005 observation, then we\ncan estimate (Sect.~5.3) $t_{2}$ to be 8$\\pm$2\\,days, and using this,\nwe can estimate (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995) the absolute magnitude at\nmaximum brightness $M_{V}$ to be --8.7$\\pm$0.6. An absolute magnitude\nof $M_{V}$=--8.7 implies a peak luminosity $\\sim$7 times the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1\\,$M_{\\odot}$ white dwarf. This is quite typical of\nnovae. With $A_{V}$=0.39$^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ (90\\% error), as derived (Predehl\n\\& Schmitt 1995) from $N_{\\rm\n  H}$=6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ (from the highest\nstatistic spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation), and with\n$M_{V}$=--8.7$\\pm$0.6, and a peak $m_{V}$ of 12.0, we can derive a\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of 115$^{+43}_{-30}$\\,kpc. As\ndiscussed above however, we are unsure as to the exact outburst date\nand the maximum brightness at outburst. Our assumed peak $m_{V}$ of\n12.0 is almost certainly an underestimation. Although we have no\ninformation in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear\nextrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,\n2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and\n12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and\n115\\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance\nestimate of 58\\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the\ndistance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\\ 2000), but a\nvalue of around 50\\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance\nestimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the\nerrors are quite large. It does appear to be the case however, that\nour distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy. This, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern\nedge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen\ncolumn densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly\nthat XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself."

On August 1, 2006, the station announced that it would be the new flagship station for the Minnesota Twins baseball team, effective with the start of the 2007 season. The Twins had been on rival WCCO since arriving in Minnesota in 1961. KSTP served as the flagship for the Twins until the end of the 2012 season, when games moved to 96.3 KTWN-FM (now KMWA). The Twins have since returned to WCCO 830. The switch to a fairly weak FM station caused dissent among some listeners, particularly in communities that had trouble picking up KSTP 1500. Although KSTP is the state's second most powerful AM station, it must operate directionally at night, delivering a reduced signal to parts of the market. WCCO, by comparison, offers a signal with a wider coverage area during the day than KSTP does, with WCCO's non-directional 50,000 watt signal. In response, the Twins have expanded the number of affiliates. On March 9, 2011, KSTP announced it would be the new flagship for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers men's and women's basketball and men's ice hockey, ending a 68-year run on WCCO. The rights have since moved to KFXN-FM, which already aired Gopher football. On March 2, 2017, KSTP announced it would be the first radio broadcaster for Minnesota United FC.

      "But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice. At the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage. You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hern\u00e1ndez, De Long, Fer\u00e1ndez."

We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so. Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians. \"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day. And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen. What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again. \"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children? Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur? And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory.

      "I just want things to be able to sort themselves out in a much more equitable fashion. We have this enormous, artificial scarcity today over the means of communication, because the government awards licenses which self-perpetuate. They are about to do the same thing, and give every broadcast television station another license for HDTV. So if you've got a license today, you get a second one; if you don't have one, you get nothing. That is going to be our policy about HDTV. I think it would be a lot better if we had more markets, more choices, and better values. I don't know how to do better values, but we know how to do more choices. So the point is, we'll wind up with some new regime which I don't think that we can particularly predict. I don't think that it is going to be chaotic or anarchic. I think there is something about people as social animals or creatures -- we will create some new forms of social organization. There will be information middlemen; there will be the equivalent of editors and packagers. There will be trusted intermediaries who help organize these new media. If you open it up and equalize things so that everybody can participate, you will get more diversity of points of view, you will get less homogenization. One of the reasons that tons of people have just dropped out, or are in terminal couch-potato-dom is that the sets of choices and the values that come across the tube are not ones that stir the human heart. And people know that. They can't figure out what to do about that, so they sort of fuzz out on drugs and alcohol. I say let's edit TV, which is the electronic drug. Let's do something about that. DAVIES: I like your idea, Mitch. I think it's sweet. (laughter) The problem is that I really worry that the ultimate test of the future is going to be the outcome of the quest, the battle between those who are looking for the sort of vision you've got of the right of the individual, the individual being the producer.

Device driven security comprises distributed and D2D security techniques. Platform driven security will focus on centralized and D2D security techniques. Whereas, network infrastructure driven security should focus on centralized and infrastructure security methods. Lastly, location driven security should harness distributed and infrastructure security techniques. In a quest to identify potential business entities operating in each of the quadrants relevant to device management, we recognize a \u2018secure device manufacturer/provider\u2019 focuses on device-driven security. Currently, multiple device manufacturers are developing devices where security features are built-in, regardless of which network or websites the users are accessing. This built-in security can be offered to multiple kinds of devices including smartphones, tablets, pcs, wearables, and even to IoT devices with communication and computation capability. These secure devices are built in a way that it will control access to potentially harmful networks, websites, and content; even without any commercially available security applications installed. However, when a customer enterprise (e.g. the future digital hospital) is buying a fleet of hundreds of such secure devices, the question raises how to manage and configure all these devices from time-to-time. In such a case, even the secure devices will need IoT-MDM services for proper management and seamless upgrading when needed. For the platform-driven security, we observe a \u2018traditional IoT-MDM system provider\u2019 can be a good example. In many cases, IoT-MDM system providers are selling there device management systems to enterprises directly."

The operation of a micro operator is spatially confined to either its premises or to a defined area of operation. As a part of the location-specific services, these micro operators can also offer IoT-MDM services for the users through outsourcing. Further, we attempt to connect the aforementioned classification and examples of different players offering IoT-MDM services with the mixed source business model approach. Table 2 summarizes our understanding on how each kind of cybersecurity provider can open and mix the core value creation logic for end users. As mentioned previously, the mixed-source business model options are: open source (open core, open extensions), open core (open core, closed extensions), open extensions (closed core, open extensions), and proprietary (closed core, closed extensions). In relation to these mixed-source options, we analyze the plausible options for each of the four distinct cybersecurity providers in the context of this study. Secure device manufacturer/provider Secure devices Proprietary (own device, own IoT-MDM platform), Open extensions (own device, outsourced IoT-MDM service). From a secure device manufacturer perspective, device business can be considered as the core operation whereas IoT-MDM services would be extended solution. A secure device manufacturer/provider can have either a proprietary model or an open extensions model. In the proprietary model, the secure device manufacturer will offer their own devices alongwith their own IoT-MDM system/service. This is a viable case in a sense that customers who are purchasing the fleet of secure devices might prefer the IoT-MDM service from the same vendor, which is ideally less risk prone."

      "Notice also that HEAD algorithm provides 283 colors after one hour compared to less than 240 colors for the conflict optimizers. We ran the three implementations on three different servers and compared the results shown in Figure . For each implementation, the x coordinate is the running time in hours, while the y coordinate is the smallest number of colors found at that time. Results on DIMACS Graphs\n\nWe tested the implementation of each team on the DIMACS instances to gauge the performance of the conflict optimizer on other classes of graphs. We compared our results to the best known bounds and to the state of the art coloring algorithms HEAD and QACOL . The time limit for Lasa's algorithms is 1 hour. CWLS is Lasa's conflict optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in TABUCOL , while PWLS is the optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in PARTIALCOL . Gitastrophe algorithm ran 10 minutes after which the number of colors no longer decreases. Shadoks algorithm ran for 1 hour without the BDFS option (results with BDFS are worse). Results are presented in Table . We only kept the difficult DIMACS instances. For the other instances, all the results match the best known bounds. The DIMACS instances had comparatively few edges (on the order of thousands or millions); the largest intersection graphs considered in the CG:SHOP challenge had over 1.5 billion edges. We notice that the conflict optimizer works extremely poorly on random graphs, but it is fast and appears to perform well on geometric graphs (r250.5, r1000.1c, r1000.5, dsjr500.1c and dsjr500.5), matching the best-known results . Interestingly, these geometric graphs are not intersection graphs as in the CG:SHOP challenge, but are generated based on a distance threshold. On the DIMACS graphs, Lasa implementation shows better performance than the other implementations."

      "And despite what Sarkozy said about resolving the issues of the Bulgarian nurses when they were sentenced to death twice, it was Saif who played a very critical role against some very powerful forces in this country that wanted to kill those people. You know, I don't know of any incidences where I, first hand, have seen evidence of him committing human rights violations, and if he did, he has to be held accountable like everyone else. And I have said that publicly and I will say that privately. So my judgment is just based upon my experience with him, the fact that he is a knowledgeable person, he understands the need to interact and interface with the West. I think he could be a viable candidate. But ultimately, my opinion is hopefully going to be the opinion of the Libyan people. BLITZER: Because you probably have seen all of the articles, the reports over the past month, month and a half, of mass murder, of killings, not only by Saif Al-Islam, but some of his brothers that have gone on, the atrocities that have been so widely reported. I hear what you're saying about his role over the recent years when the Bush administration, and later the Obama administration, was trying to improve relations with Libya, but over the past several weeks, based on all of the international reporting we have seen, it's been a brutal record that he has accomplished. WELDON: Well, again, I don't have firsthand evidence of that. I just got here two days ago. And I fully support an international tribunal to look at human rights violations on everyone in this country. That's necessary. And if they find evidence that he has been involved in that, then he should suffer the consequences of his actions. (END VIDEOTAPE) BLITZER: In our next hour, part two of the interview with former congressman Curt Weldon. There have been some questions raised about his motive. Is he in all of this for the money? You're going to find out his answer to that and more. Stand by. Also, Washington, D.C.'s congressional delegate is telling colleagues -- and I'm quoting her now -- \"Go to hell.\""

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain. Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home) , the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock. This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time."

The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350\u00a0kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point. National Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360\u00a0kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network. It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460\u00a0kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950\u00a0kHz and later on 26,150\u00a0kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500\u00a0kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference."

      "\\section{Introduction}\nCognitive deficit of older adults is one of the biggest global public health challenges in elderly care. Approximately 5.2 million people of 65 and older are suffered with any form of cognitive impairments in United States in 2012 \\cite{stat12}. Dementia is one of the major causes of the cognitive impairments which is more acute among 85 and older population (50\\%) \\cite{stat12}. However, the costs (financial and time) of health care and long-term care for individuals with Alzheimer's (special form of dementia) or other dementias are substantial. For example, during 2016, about 15.9 million family and friends in United States provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance to those with cognitive impairments which is a contribution to the nation valued at \\$230.1 billion. One the other hand, total payments for all individuals with all form of cognitive impairments are estimated at \\$259 billion. Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from \\$259 billion in 2017 to more than \\$1.1 trillion in 2050. Among the above costs, a significant amount are relevant to clinical and diagnostic tests \\cite{stat17}. Although clinical and diagnostic tests have become more precise in identifying dementia, studies have shown that there is a high degree of underrecognition especially in early detection. However, there are many advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed as the root cause findings of impairment always lessen the progress of impairment status and sometimes symptoms can be reversible and cured. With the proliferation of emerging ubiquitous computing technologies, many mobile and wearable devices have been available to capture continuous functional and physiological behavior of older adults. Wearable sensors are now capable of estimating number of steps being taken, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and physiological outcomes (heart rate, skin conductance) of older adults \\cite{sano15}."

      "Contributions of our work are summarized as follows: 1. In our pipeline, we propose a novel algorithm that enables us to complete contours that appear to be connected to each other in an illusory form. 2. Our model is trained on just one single query image and does not need any training data. 3. Our model does not need to know which regions of the image are masked or occluded, i.e., we remove the dependency of the algorithm on the guiding mask (a guiding mask is a mask that informs the model on where the missing regions are located at). We also introduce two metrics to produce a stopping criterion to know when to stop training before the model fully overfits to the incomplete image, i.e., we guide the model to stop when the completed image is produced. Methods\n\nOur eyes are trained to predict a missing region of an occluded object within a scene. We can easily perceive or make guesses about parts of objects or shapes that we do not necessarily see. Even when we are looking at an image, we might guess about the shape, property, or other attributes of an unknown object within a scene. Such capability extends beyond just known objects or shapes. We can look at a disconnected set of contours and guess what the connected form may look like. This capability is rooted in our prior knowledge about the world. (see Figure ). In this work, we aim to achieve a similar capability using deep generative networks. Most neural networks that we work with these days are trained with a massive amount of data and one might think that this is the only way that a neural network can obtain prior information. Authors of Deep Image Prior (DIP) suggest that the convolutional architecture can capture a fair amount of information about image distribution. They show that the hourglass architectures like UNet can show some good performances in some inverse problems such as image denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. In this work, we focus on completing fragmented contours end-to-end just by using a single image."

From there, the gas then travelled the next third of the distance to the second and virtually identical compressor platform, H7. This was also responsible for maintaining pressure, but additional compression was seldom required on this final leg of the journey to Emden. Both platforms stood on the German continental shelf, but 48 kilometres of the pipeline also ran across the Danish North Sea sector. The pipeline is trenched or covered with sand.

    "question": "What is the primary reason for the improved performance of the PLS algorithm when applied to decorrelated data?",
    "choices": [
      "A) The decorrelation step reduces the dimensionality of the data, making it easier for the PLS algorithm to identify the most relevant features.",
      "B) The decorrelation step helps to eliminate the non-stationarity in the data, allowing the PLS algorithm to converge more quickly.",
      "C) The decorrelation step improves the estimation of the covariance matrix \u03a3, which is necessary for the PLS algorithm to accurately identify the atomic dynamics relevant for Y.",
      "D) The decorrelation step allows the PLS algorithm to ignore the long-range dependence in the data, which is not relevant for the problem at hand."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",

      "have shown that the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm performs exceptionally well on this type of data, leading to a small-dimensional and robust representation of proteins, which is able to identify the atomic dynamics relevant for Y . Singer et al. ( ) studied the convergence rates of the PLS algorithm for dependent observations and showed that decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm improves its performance. Since Y is a linear combination of columns of X, it can be assumed that Y and all columns of X have the same correlation structure. Hence, it is sufficient to estimate \u03a3 = cov(Y ) to decorrelate the data for the PLS algorithm, i.e., \u03a3 \u22121/2 Y = \u03a3 \u22121/2 X\u03b2 + \u03a3 \u22121/2 results in a standard linear regression with independent errors. Our goal now is to estimate \u03a3 and compare the performance of the PLS algorithm on original and decorrelated data. For this purpose, we divided the data set into a training and a test set (each with p = 10 000 observations). First, we tested whether the data are stationary. The augmented Dickey-Fuller test confirmed stationarity for Y with a p-value< 0.01. The Hurst exponent of Y is 0.85, indicating moderate long-range dependence supported by a rather slow decay of the sample autocovariances (see grey line in the left plot of Figure ). Therefore, we set q = 1 for the VST-DCT estimator to match the low smoothness of the corresponding spectral density. Moreover, the smoothing parameter is selected with the restricted maximum likelihood method and T = 550 bins are used. Obviously, the performance of the PLS algorithm on the decorrelated data is significantly better for the small number of components. In particular, with just one PLS component, the correlation between the true opening diameter on the test set and its prediction that takes into account the dependence in the data is already 0.54, while it is close to zero for PLS that ignores the dependence in the data. showed that the estimator of \u03b2 based on one PLS component is exactly the ensemble-weighted maximally correlated mode (ewMCM), which is defined as the collective mode of atoms that has the highest probability to achieve a specific alteration of the response Y ."

      "On-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell. We infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state. Concurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations. Finally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.\n. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. )."

      "contour completion problem . Different types of lines and curves have been studied to maximize the connectivity of two broken ends in the planer contour completion problem. Geometry-based constraints can be utilized to address some challenges of contour completion problems, such as smoothness and curvature consistency . However, such approaches only work for simple, smooth contours and usually fail in more complex settings. On the other hand, we currently have deep models that could easily take an incomplete image and complete the missing regions using enough training data . The amazing capability of such models especially those that are trained on different modalities with millions or billions of training data raises the question of whether we need such a large amount of training to perceive all the visual cues that are present in an image, which underlies visual perception by humans. In human vision, Gestalt psychology suggests that our brain is designed to perceive structures and patterns that are grouped by some known rules. In this work, we show that some perceptual structures can also be learned from the image itself directly using architectures that enable such learning. Earlier work has shown  This is an extraordinary capability of our human brain and in this paper, we tried to see whether convolutional neural networks can show such capabilities. that some forms of perceptual grouping can be achieved using computational models, such as stochastic completion fields . This type of learning resonates with some of the Gestalt perceptual grouping principles including \"proximity\", \"good continuation\" and \"similarity\". In scenarios where color and/or texture are present, the cue of \"similarity\" helps us group regions with consistent patterns . When color and texture are present, they provide a collection of rich information for such cues. In the present article, we probe convolutional neural networks in a scenario where both are absent, and the neural network is dealing with just forms and shapes."

      "Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25\u20131.7%, with a prevalence of 2\u201310 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency. Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5\u20131 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]\nIn the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose. In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow."

But the attorney, even though he was just vaguely familiar with Aspergers, has been very good with Craig. He has the compassion and excellence that is needed here. What started out very bad is turning into a good thing. It will probably take another 90 days or more. But Craig is working hard. Too hard sometimes. He goes to therapy 3 times a week. Doing excellent. He's more focused and can calm down easier. He's got a lot on his plate but has support from his family. From his attorney. From therapy. And from his work. He has been renting a room from a lady who has a son with ADHD. It is good for him. I'm a little worried though because since she smokes he wants to find his own place. With all the costs he has to balance it out financially. That is good. I can't help him more than I am which is good. He is stepping up and taking responsibility. He is listening much better. He is going to have an evaluation today to get an accurate diagnosis. I understand that is a little difficult since he is an adult. Also the PTSD may cover it over. The attorney stated it would help to have the diagnosis. Aware this is a long update, but thanks for reading. I am fighting much guilt still but I have a lot of peace now. My daughter and her 4 year old son also have Aspergers symptoms. So my life chapters may not close for a while. :-) My name is Mac.

For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache. \"On September 18, he complained of feeling 'out of sorts,' and stayed in his officer's quarters. His head pounded and L. decided to write a letter. .. (he wrote to his mother, and referred to his one-year old son Houston and the baby his wife Mabel was about to have: they were staying with his mother in the US). ..That night, L. started to feel chilled as the fever came on. He never went to sleep but worked at his desk all through the night, trying to get all the information about the mosquitoes organized. By morning, he showed all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever. The camp doctors made the diagnosis, and L. agreed to go to the yellow fever ward. ..L. was carried by litter out of the two-room, white pine board house in which he had lived since he and Mabel first arrived in Cuba. .. (In the yellow fever ward, in a separate one-room building), Lena Warner (the immune nurse who had survived the yellow fever in 1878, when she was nine, and was found in her boarded-up house by a former slave who first thought she was dead, and carried her to safety) nursed J.L., recording his vitals. (I put up a link to his case record and vital signs last week. The surgeon general required that this record be made for every yellow fever patient.)...

      "If we use ${t}$ to slice our spacetime into three-dimensional hyperplanes, each corresponding to ``space at time ${t}$,'' then each of those 3-spaces has the same spatial geometry. A mixed term would indicate that those slices of space would need to be shifted relative to another in order to identify corresponding points. The mixed term's absence indicates that in adapted coordinates, there is no need for such an extra shift. In those coordinates, we can talk about the 3-spaces as just ``space,'' without the need for specifying which of the slices we are referring to. In the case of spherical symmetry, we can introduce spherical coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry: a radial coordinate $r$ and the usual angular coordinates $\\vartheta,\\varphi$, so that the spherical shell at constant $r$ has the total area $4\\pi r^2$. In consequence, the part of our metric involving $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$ will have the standard form\n\\begin{equation}\nr^2(\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\varphi^2) \\equiv r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the right-hand side defines $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2$, the infinitesimal solid angle corresponding to each particular combination of $\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varphi$.\n\nThe radial coordinate slices space into spherical shells, each corresponding to a particular value $r=const.$ The rotations around the origin, which are the symmetry transformations of spherical symmetry, map each of those spherical shells onto itself, and they leave all physical quantities that do not explicitly depend on $\\vartheta$ or $\\varphi$ invariant. In what follows, we will use the basic structures introduced in this way --- the slices of simultaneous ${t}$, the radial directions within each slice, the angular coordinates spanning the symmetry--adapted spherical shells of area $4\\pi r^2$ --- as auxiliary structures for introducing spacetime coordinates. For now, let us write down the shape that our metric has by simple virtue of the spherical symmetry, the requirement that the spacetime be static, and the adapted coordinates, namely\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \\mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \\mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\\:\\mathrm{d}\\Omega^2."

      "In this work, we propose a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in the V2X network. A coupled generalized dynamic Bayesian network (C-GDBN) is employed to learn the interaction between RF signals received by the RSU from multiple vehicles and their corresponding trajectories. This integration of vehicles' positional information with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications allows semantic learning while mapping RF signals with vehicles' trajectories and enables the RSU to jointly predict the RF signals it expects to receive from the vehicles from which it can anticipate the expected trajectories. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \\textit{i)} A joint GPS spoofing and jamming detection method is proposed for the V2X scenario, which is based on learning a generative interactive model as the C-GDBN. Such a model encodes the cross-correlation between the RF signals transmitted by multiple vehicles and their trajectories, where their semantic meaning is coupled stochastically at a high abstraction level. \\textit{ii)} A cognitive RSU equipped with the acquired C-GDBN can predict and estimate vehicle positions based on real-time RF signals. This allows RSU to evaluate whether both RF signals and vehicles' trajectories are evolving according to the dynamic rules encoded in the C-GDBN and, consequently, to identify the cause (i.e., a jammer attacking the V2I or a spoofer attacking the satellite link) of the abnormal behaviour that occurred in the V2X environment. \\textit{iii)} Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the vehicles' trajectories from the predicted RF signals, effectively detect any abnormal behaviour and identify the type of abnormality occurring with high detection probabilities. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies the joint detection of jamming and spoofing in V2X systems. \\section{System model and problem formulation}\nThe system model depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig_SystemModel}, includes a single cell vehicular network consisting of a road side unit (RSU) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{R}=[{x}_{R},{y}_{R}]$, a road side jammer (RSJ) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{J}=[{x}_{J},{y}_{J}]$, a road side spoofer (RSS) located at $\\mathrm{p}_{s}=[{x}_{s},{y}_{s}]$ and $N$ vehicles moving along multi-lane road in an urban area."

      "We remind as displayed in Fig. 2(a) that a finite bandgap opens only for strain larger than $\\sim 23 \\%$ and the zigzag (not armchair) is the preferred direction for bandgap opening under a tensile strain \\cite{per209}. We extend our investigation to the case of compressive strain and find  (see in Fig. 2(b) ) that (i) the same gap threshold of $\\sigma \\simeq 23 \\%$ is observed but (ii) the preferred direction to open the gap under a compressive strain is the armchair, not the zigzag as the case of tensile strain. This implies that the properties of graphene bandstructure at low energy should be qualitatively the same when applying strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma ,\\theta } \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma ,\\theta + 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. This feature can be understood by considering, for example, strains of $\\left\\{ {\\sigma , \\theta = 0} \\right\\}$ and of $\\left\\{ {-\\sigma , \\theta = 90^\\circ} \\right\\}$. Indeed, these strains result in the same qualitative changes on the bond-lengths, i.e., an increased bond-length $r_3$ and reduced bond-lengths $r_{1,2}$. However, for the same strain strength, because of the exponential dependence of hoping energies on the bond-lengths, the compressive strain generally induces a larger bandgap than the tensile one, as can be seen when comparing the data displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). To conclude, we would like to emphasize that a large strain is necessary to open a bandgap in graphene. This could be an issue for practical applications, compared to the use of graphene strained junctions explored in \\cite{hung14}. We now go to explore the properties of conduction gap in the graphene strained junctions. In Fig. 3, we display the conductance as a function of energy computed from Eq. (5) using the Green's function technique. As discussed above, a small strain of a few percent (e.g., 4 $\\%$ here) can not change the gapless character of graphene, i.e., there is no gap of conductance in the case of uniformly strained graphene. However, similar to that reported in \\cite{hung14}, a significant conduction-gap of a few hundreds meV can open in the unstrained/strained graphene junctions."

      "In addition, hemoglobin H tends to precipitate out in the cells, causing damage to the red blood cell membrane. When affected individuals are exposed to certain drugs and chemicals known to make the membrane more fragile, the cells are thought to become vulnerable to breakdown in large numbers, a complication called hemolytic anemia. Fever and infection are also considered to be triggers of hemolytic anemia in hemoglobin H disease. This can result in fatigue, paleness, and a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of eyes called jaundice. Usually, the anemia is mild enough not to require treatment. Severe anemia events may require blood transfusion, however, and are usually accompanied by such other symptoms as dark feces or urine and abdominal or back pain. These events are uncommon in hemoglobin H disease, although they occur more frequently in a more serious type of hemoglobin H disease called hemoglobin H/Constant Spring disease. Individuals effected with this type of hemoglobin H disease are also more likely to have enlargement of and other problems with the spleen. Alpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha globin is a necessary component of all major hemoglobins and some minor hemoglobins, absence of all functioning alpha globin genes leads to serious medical consequences that begin even before birth. Affected fetuses develop severe anemia as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. The placenta, heart, liver, spleen, and adrenal glands may all become enlarged. Fluid can begin collecting throughout the body as early as the start of the second trimester, causing damage to developing tissues and organs. Growth retardation is also common. Affected fetuses usually miscarry or die shortly after birth. In addition, women carrying affected fetuses are at increased risk of developing complications of pregnancy and delivery. Up to 80% of such women develop toxemia, a disturbance of metabolism that can potentially lead to convulsions and coma. Other maternal complications include premature delivery and increased rates of delivery by cesarean section, as well as hemorrhage after delivery."

The viscosity effect is feeble compared to the shock compression effect, so it does not significantly affect the deformation of the bubble. Therefore, in this part, the relaxation time \u03c4 is set sufficiently small. The inflow (outflow) boundary condition is used in the left (right) boundary, and the periodic boundary is adopted in the y direction. The first-order forward difference scheme is used to calculate the temporal derivative, and the second-order nonoscillatory nonfree dissipative scheme is adopted to solve the spatial derivative in Eq. ( ) . Two quantitative comparisons between experimental results and DBM simulations are shown in the following part, including snapshots of schlieren images and evolutions of characteristic scales for the bubble. The first is shown in Fig. non-organized momentum flux (NOMF) uously to form a diffracted shock (DS). As TS propagates, it will split into three branches due to the considerable pressure perturbations caused by the gradual decay of the DS strength . Afterward, as shown in the subfigure at about t = 128\u00b5s, two high pressure regions (ROH) generate because of the interaction of these branches. Subsequently, at about t = 148\u00b5s, the two ROHs meet, causing the shock focusing. On the one hand, at about t = 168\u00b5s, the shock focusing causes the generation of downstream-propagating second transmitted shock (STS) and upward-moving rarefaction wave. On the other hand, it will produce high pressure region inside the bubble, which later leads to a jet structure, as shown at about t = 288\u00b5s. At about t = 428\u00b5s, due to the deposited vorticity, there will produce a pair of counter-rotating vortexes at the pole region of the bubble. The further development of the vortex pair and the effect of viscosity decrease the amplitude of the jet."

Between 1999 and 2001, Medicaid shelled out $935,634 for OxyContin prescriptions written by Luyao. That was just OxyContin. Luyao was prescribing an array of addictive drugs. In the 12 months leading up to the clinic raid, Medicaid paid roughly $1 million for 7,000 prescriptions, only about 17 percent of them for OxyContin. Nor did the raid slow her down. Between the raid and her arrest on trafficking charges four months later, Luyao wrote another 282 OxyContin prescriptions billed to Medicaid. She was not an outlier. In 24 months, taxpayers footed the bill for more than 49 million doses of pills containing oxycodone, even though there were only 1.36 million Medicaid patients. Half were children. The sheer volume of pills might have been a tipoff that the drugs were not all intended for legitimate use. So were arrest reports dating to 2001. One man had used his 7-year-old son\u2019s Medicaid number to doctor-shop for OxyContin. A Miramar pharmacist who billed Medicaid $3.7 million for OxyContin pills was charged with paying Medicaid patients $150 each to use their IDs.

History of data production and publication\nArchaeobotanical data falls within the category of observational data in archaeology (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). Archaeobotanical data is considered as the quantitative assessment of plant macrofossils present within a sample from a discrete archaeological context, which can include species identification, plant part, levels of identification (cf. \u2013 confer or \u201ccompares to\u201d), and a range of quantification methods including count, minimum number of individuals, levels of abundance and weight (Popper 1988). Archaeobotanical data is usually entered into a two-way data table organised by sample number. Alongside the counts of individual taxa, other information is also necessary to interpret archaeobotanical data, including sample volume, flot volume, charcoal volume, flot weight, level of preservation, sample number, context number, feature number, feature type and period. Beyond taxonomic identifications, a range of other types of data are increasingly gathered on individual plant macrofossils (morphometric measurements, isotopic values, aDNA). Archaeobotanical training places a strong emphasis on recording data on a sample-by-sample basis (Jacomet & Kreuz 1999: 138\u2013139; Jones & Charles 2009; Pearsall 2016: 97\u2013107). Time-consuming methodologies utilised in the pursuit of accurate sample-level data recording include sub-sampling and splitting samples into size fractions and counting a statistically useful number of items per sample (Van der Veen & Fieller 1982). The creation of sample-level data means analysis is often undertaken on the basis of individual samples, for instance the assessment of crop-processing stages and weed ecological evidence for crop husbandry practices. The analysis of sample level data also enables archaeobotanical finds to be integrated alongside contextual evidence from archaeological sites. Requirements for the publication of this data are in place in some archaeological guidelines, for instance current Historic England guidelines for archaeological practice in England (Campbell, Moffett & Straker 2011: 8)."

It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase. There is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible. There is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5. There are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?"

      "\u00a7Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life is a prominent phenomenon in soils and sediment ecology resulting from anaerobic respiration. The microbial fuel cell mimics this ubiquitous natural phenomenon. Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants. In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. \"Revitalization\" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films. As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha."

      "The bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process. The goal is to prevent a vertex in conflict with some adjacent colored vertices from entering in the conflict set. At the first level, the algorithm searches for a recoloring of some adjacent vertices which allows us to directly recolor the conflict vertex. If no solution is found, the algorithm In both figures the algorithm uses p = 1.2, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. For \u03c3 \u2265 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. could recolor some vertices at larger distances from the conflict vertex. To do so, a local search is performed by trying to recolor vertices at a bounded distance from the conflict vertex in the current partial solution. The BDFS algorithm has two parameters: adjacency bound a max and depth d. In order to recolor a vertex v, BDFS gets the set C of color classes with at most a max neighbors of v. If a class in C has no neighbor of v, v is assigned to C. Otherwise, for each class C \u2208 C, BDFS tries to recolor the vertices in C which are adjacent to v by recursively calling itself with depth d \u2212 1. At depth d = 0 the algorithm stops trying to color the vertices. During the challenge the Shadoks used BDFS with parameters a max = 3 and d = 3. The depth was increased to 5 (resp. 7) when the number of vertices in the queue was 2 (resp. 1). Degeneracy order Given a target number of colors k, we call easy vertices a set of vertices Y such that, if the remainder of the vertices of G are colored using k colors, then we are guaranteed to be able to color all vertices of G with k colors. This is obtained using the degeneracy order Y . To obtain Y we iteratively remove from the graph a vertex v that has at most k \u2212 1 neighbors, appending v to the end of Y . We repeat until no other vertex can be added to Y . Notice that, once we color the remainder of the graph with at least k colors, we can use a greedy coloring for Y in order from last to first without increasing the number of colors used."

      "We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate \u03b7 p and amplitudes of different terms \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it). To have comparable results, we divide \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate \u03b7 p with \u03b8 max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, \u03b7 norm p = \u03b7 p \u2022 \u03b8 max . In the following, we always use normalized \u03b7 p and \u03b8, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism . The agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation. The remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (\u03c3 = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task. We first look at the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition. The first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the \"correct\" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions."

      "Discussion. We have uncovered the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect characteristic of layer hybridized electronic states in twisted bilayers, and elucidated its geometric origin in the k -space curl of interlayer BCP. It offers a new tool for rectification and frequency doubling in chiral vdW bilayers, and is sizable in tTMD and tBG. Here our focus is on the intrinsic effect, which can be evaluated quantitatively for each material and provides a benchmark for experiments. There may also be extrinsic contributions, similar to the side jump and skew scattering ones in anomalous Hall effect. They typically have distinct scaling behavior with the relaxation time \u03c4 from the intrinsic effect, hence can be distinguished from the latter in experiments . Moreover, they are suppressed in the clean limit \u03c9\u03c4 1 [(\u03c9\u03c4 ) 2 1, more precisely] . In high-quality tBG samples, \u03c4 \u223c ps at room temperature . Much longer \u03c4 can be obtained at lower temperatures. In fact, a recent theory explaining well the resistivity of tBG predicted \u03c4 \u223c 10 \u22128 s at 10 K . As such, high-quality tBG under low temperatures and sub-terahertz input (\u03c9/2\u03c0 = 0.1 THz) is located in the clean limit, rendering an ideal platform for isolating the intrinsic effect. This work paves a new route to driving in-plane response by out-of-plane dynamical control of layered vdW structures . The study can be generalized to other observables such as spin current and spin polarization, and the in-plane driving can be statistical forces, like temperature gradient. Such orthogonal controls rely critically on the nonconservation of layer pseudospin degree of freedom endowed by interlayer coupling, and constitute an emerging research field at the crossing of 2D vdW materials, layertronics, twistronics and nonlinear electronics.

The final single dimensional score represents machine learning based TS score.\n\\section{Physiological Sensor Signals Processing} The autonomic nervous system (ANS) restrains the body's physiological activities including the heart rate, skin gland secretion, blood pressure, and respiration. The ANS is divided into sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches. While SNS actuates the body's resources for action under arousal conditions, PNS attenuates the body to help regain the steady state. Mental arousal (say stress, anxiety etc.) activates the sweat gland causing the increment and reduction of  Skin Conductance on SNS and PNS physiological conditions respectively. However, Instant Heart Rate also has similar effect on SNS and PNS physiological condtions i.e., a higher value of heart rate is the effect of SNS and lower value is the outcome of PNS. EDA and PPG sensors are widely used to estimate the instant value of skin conductance and heart rate respectively \\cite{alam16}. \\subsection{EDA Sensor Signal Processing}\nEDA is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin which varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. There are three types of arousal: \\emph{cognitive, affective and physical}. \\emph{Cognitive} arousal occurs when a person tries to solve any problem using her cognitive ability. \\emph{Affective} arousal occurs when a person is worried, frightened or angry either doing daily activities or in resting position. On the other hand, \\emph{physical} arousal is related to the brain command to move bodily parts which is imposed on the total arousal as an artifact, called \\emph{motion artifact}. However, there are always some noises due to the weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and device motion."

      "The cost of the $600 million project is being equally shared by the two countries. The MTA, when developed, will have ready market for 205 aircraft - 45 for the Indian Air Force, 100 for the Russian Air Force, and 60 more for exporting to friendly countries. The international market for MTA is estimated at 390 planes. Under the agreement, thirty percent of the annual production of planes could be exported to third countries. The MTA was expected to go in service with the Russian and Indian Air Forces in 2015. But the project faced a number of problems, delaying the development of the MTA. The project got into rough weather after India felt there was nothing much for Indian engineers and scientists to do in the design and development of the MTA. However, all the issues related to the project were resolved with the Russians when the HAL undertook to carry out design and development of its work-share of MTA at Aircraft R&D Centre at Bangalore. Russian Ilyushin Design Bureau and the Irkut Corporation and HAL are participating in the project. The first flight is expected to take place in 2017-18. The MTA would replace the AN- 32 aircraft being used by the IAF. It will be used for both cargo and troop transportation, para-drop and air drop of supplies, including low-altitude parachute extraction system.

They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities."

    "documentation": [
      "Therefore, hemoglobin E is unique in that it is both a quantitative (i.e. thalassemia-like) and qualitative trait. When co-inherited with a beta thalassemia trait, it causes a disease that is almost indistinguishable from beta thalassemia disease. Large deletions around and including the beta globin gene can lead to delta/beta thalassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Interestingly, delta/beta thalassemia trait behaves very similarly to beta thalassemia trait in its clinical manifestations. However, HPFH trait does not tend to cause hemoglobin disease when co-inherited with a second thalassemia or other beta globin mutation. ALPHA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have four normal copies of the alpha globin gene, two copies on each chromosome 16. These genes make the alpha globin component of normal adult hemoglobin, which is called hemoglobin A. Alpha globin is also a component of fetal hemoglobin and the other major adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin A2. Mutations of the alpha globin genes are usually deletions of the gene, resulting in absent production of alpha globin. Since there are four genes (instead of the usual two) to consider when looking at alpha globin gene inheritance, there are several alpha globin types that are possible. Absence of one alpha globin gene leads to a condition known as silent alpha thalassemia trait. This condition causes no health problems and can be detected only by special genetic testing. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs when two alpha globin genes are missing. This can occur in two ways. The genes may be deleted from the same chromosome, causing the 'cis' type of alpha thalassemia trait. Alternately, they may be deleted from different chromosomes, causing the 'trans' type of alpha thalassemia trait. In both instances, there are no associated health problems, although the trait status may be detected by more routine blood screening. Hemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of three alpha globin genes, such that there is only one functioning gene."

The channel is then displayed to the user with an interface generated by the user interface engine 260. Referring now to FIG. 3B, one embodiment of a scoring engine 211 is shown in more detail. The scoring engine 211 includes a query generator 301, a global scorer 302 and a content stream generator 304 that are each coupled to signal line 228. The global scorer 302 is used to rank new content items that are stored in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 (depending upon the embodiment). The global scorer 302 uses signals from the different verticals to compute a global user-independent score for each item to approximate its popularity or importance within the stream that produced it. The global scorer 302 normalizes the score across streams so that items from various streams are comparable to aid in generating a quick yet reasonable ranking of items. The global score is a combination of its quality specific to the source stream (depending on the rank of the source, number of known followers of a source, etc.) and its global popularity (trigger rate on universal search, relevance to trending queries, number of clicks, long clicks received, etc.). The global scorer 302 transmits the global score to storage where it is associated with the item. The global score helps rank the items for faster retrieval. For example, if the query generated by the query generator 301 includes a request for the top ten items about skiing, those items are already organized in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 according to the global score. The query generator 301 receives a request for a stream of content for a channel from the channel engine 240. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel attributes that are included in the request."

      "In order to speed up the convergence of radiative transfer in clouds, a quasi-diffusion method has been developed \\cite{aristova}. In addition, the DSA-multigrid method was developed to solve problems in electron transport more efficiently \\cite{trucksin}. One of the most recent convergence methods developed is Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration (FPSA) \\cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}. FPSA accelerates up to $N$ moments of the angular flux and has shown significant improvement in the convergence rate for the types of problems described above. The method returns a speed-up of several orders of magnitude with respect to wall-clock time when compared to DSA  \\cite{JapanFPSA}. In this paper, we introduce a new acceleration technique, called \\textit{Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration} (NFPA). This  method  returns  a  modified  Fokker-Planck (FP) equation  that  preserves  the  angular moments of the flux given by the transport  equation. This preservation of moments is particularly appealing for applications to multiphysics problems \\cite{multiphysics}, in which the coupling between the transport physics and the other physics can be done through the (lower-order) FP equation. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a numerical method that returns a Fokker-Planck-like equation that is discretely consistent with the linear Boltzmann equation. This paper is organized as follows. \\Cref{sec2} starts with a brief description of FPSA. Then, we derive the NFPA scheme. In \\cref{sec3}, we discuss the discretization schemes used in this work and present numerical results. These are compared against standard acceleration techniques. We conclude with a discussion in \\cref{sec4}. \\section{Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\\label{sec2}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0} In this section we briefly outline the theory behind FPSA, describe NFPA for monoenergetic, steady-state transport problems in slab geometry, and present the numerical methodology behind NFPA. The theory given here can be easily extended to higher-dimensional problems."

      "Labels: Kevin Pierre-Louis, Links, Phil Steele, Steve Hailey\nNo King at BC may be a good thing\nNearly everything that needs to be said about Penn State and Joe Paterno has been said. But one point that Bruce Feldman made regarding College Football's King culture reminded me of how different BC is from most FBS schools. We don't and never have had a \"King.\" I've often longed for that iconic winner that could serve as the face of the program, but maybe it is better that we don't. For whatever we miss by not having a \"Woody\" or a \"JoePa\" or \"Bear\" we also avoid the power struggles and corruption that often comes with an all-powerful Head Coach. What does a King really provide anyway? Branding...a little nostalgia...someone to embrace. But it doesn't really win you football games or make you a better school. Florida State's losing in the final Bowden years proved that and Penn State has a permanent stain on their whole community because of their Kingdom. BC's had some dynamic leaders, but none have ever stayed long enough to reach statue status. Our winningest coach and longest tenured even left and no one put up a fight to keep him. TOB could have been our icon. A little more fire and one or two more critical wins and we would have celebrated him like other schools have done with their biggest winners. But it wasn't to be and that's probably a good thing. When I've profiled coaching candidates in the past, I've hoped that one would stay for a long time. That's changed. I don't want a guy who want to be bigger than the University. Things are better that way.

      "Once the most likely network has been identified through the decimation procedure, we perform the same analysis displayed in Fig. \\ref{Jor1_dec}  for ordered and then quenched disordered real-valued couplings\nand in Fig. \\ref{Jor3_dec} for  complex-valued ordered couplings. In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg},\n  the PLM with decimation leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. \\ref{MF_PL_err} and \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in respect to ones of the PLM with $l_2$-regularization. These two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-field technique previously implemented on the same XY systems\\cite{Tyagi15}. For what concerns the network of connecting links, in Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the TP curves obtained with the three techniques. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. The four graphs are related to different sample sizes, with $M$ increasing clockwise. When $M$ is high enough, all techniques reproduce the true network. However, for lower values of $M$ the performances of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and with decimation drastically overcome those ones of the previous mean field technique. In particular, for $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field method fails to find more than half of the couplings. When $M=128$, the network is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with decimation while the PLM with $l_2$ regularization underestimates the couplings. Furthermore, we notice that the PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$ signalling that it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime $M<N$.  \n \n \nIn Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_err} we compare the temperature behaviour of the reconstruction error. In can be observed that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes  the reconstruction error, ${\\rm err_J}$, (plotted here in log-scale) obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than \nthat one obtained with the other techniques."

      "The qualitative relation between \u03b7 p and parameters of environment d e , \u03c3 and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form \u2206W t = \u03b7 p X t [\u03b1 y R t + \u03b2 y ]. Thus, the \u2206W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b2 y /\u03b1 y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold. These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously. Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions. The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red). In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food."

      "Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home\nFront Page \u00bb Time to clean house in Paso Robles\nSeptember 5, 2010 Opinion By JIM REED\nI\u2019d like to give you an update on the issue of our civil servants cramming hundreds of millions of dollars in spending down our throats after the people of Paso Robles voted down the water rate increase last November. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney. Even if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again. There is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles. It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens\u2019 wishes. City Councilmen Ed Steinbeck, Nick Gilman and Mayor Duane Picanco, on August 19th, voted unanimously to hire the same law firm employed by the City of Bell. You may have heard the recent news story about the City of Bell\u2019s corrupt city representatives. This law firm allowed the elected officials and City employees to pillage the General Fund for their own benefit, contrary to the rights and interests of the citizens. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. What does this say about our elected representatives? I believe most residents are like me. We elect people we believe have our best interest in mind. Over the last few years I have seen that nothing is farther from the truth. The people we have elected have lost track of the fact that \u201cthe City\u201d exists to protect and deliver services to the citizens. To them it is some all-important ideal they strive to cultivate and improve according to their agenda. They have forgotten that they are elected to represent the citizens. We have an election coming up in November. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us."

      "Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies. In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse. Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions. The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures. Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\". In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance. After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted. In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy. U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\" In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\"."

But the story is familiar and the consequences tragic. We live in those consequences. So what does this story have to tell us about the world today and our lives in it? You can learn a lot about sin and humanity by really chewing on the details here. Consider:\nThe serpent (we\u2019re later told it\u2019s also Satan) begins with questioning what God has said. The question overgeneralizes and invites a conversation. The woman adds to God\u2019s commandment. The serpent challenges God and offers a desirable half-truth. The woman (although perfect) is tempted. That temptation draws her to inspect the fruit. Looking at the fruit, the woman focused on the positive side of the equation. She risked her life trusting the serpent over God, because eating the fruit should have meant certain death. The man ate without any signs of a struggle. Their eyes were open. Before they knew only the good; now they knew good and evil. Their first response to sin is to cover up, which indicates fear and probably shame. Their response to God (their creator whom they knew personally!) was to hide. Apparently they either didn\u2019t know or forgot that God is everywhere and knows everything. God asks the man a question for effect. The man blames his wife and even seems to accuse God. The woman blames the serpent and even seems to deflect by saying she was tricked. At this point God punishes the serpent, the man, and the woman by cursing all creation. Work will be hard, childbearing will be painful. But there is hope in the promise of One to come who will crush the serpent. I love how the Good News glimmers even in that first dark moment. It\u2019s so tempting to read more into the story because there are so many more details we wish we had. The gaps in the story invite our imaginations to jump in, but we need to be careful not to put words in God\u2019s mouth. One theme we see in the Fall is one broken relationship after another."

      "\\section{Introduction}\n\nSpectral line surveys have revealed that high-mass star-forming\nregions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species\nto complex and larger molecules (e.g.,\n\\citealt{schilke1997b,hatchell1998b,comito2005,bisschop2007}). However, there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the\nchemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest\nevolutionary stages, i.e., from High-Mass Starless Cores (HMSCs) and\nHigh-Mass Cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass protostars\ndestined to become massive stars, via High-Mass Protostellar Objects\n(HMPOs) to the final stars that are able to produce Ultracompact H{\\sc\n  ii} regions (UCH{\\sc ii}s, see \\citealt{beuther2006b} for a recent\ndescription of the evolutionary sequence). The first two evolutionary\nstages are found within so-called Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). While\nfor low-mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular\nfreeze-out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied (e.g.,\n\\citealt{bergin1997,dutrey1997,pavlyuchenkov2006,joergensen2007}),\nit is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present\nduring massive star formation. To better understand the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming\nregions we initiated a program to investigate the chemical properties\nfrom IRDCs to UCH{\\sc ii}s from an observational and theoretical\nperspective. We start with single-dish line surveys toward a large\nsample obtaining their basic characteristics, and then perform\ndetailed studies of selected sources using interferometers on smaller\nscales. These observations are accompanied by theoretical modeling of\nthe chemical processes. Long-term goals are the chemical\ncharacterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star\nformation, the development of chemical clocks, and the identification\nof molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes\nduring different evolutionary stages. Here, we present an initial\nstudy of the reactive radical ethynyl (C$_2$H) combining single-dish\nand interferometer observations with chemical modeling."

      "Ann's Mega Dub: 12/19/10 - 12/26/10\nGot o have a penis to be an expert\nThursday on NPR's Fresh Air, Terry Gross wanted to talk film and music. Since women don't know a thing about either and aren't interested in either, Terry had to find men who were 'experts. 'This is C.I.'s \" Iraq snapshot Friday, December 24, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Nouri's incomplete Cabinet continues to receive criticism, a father offers an 'excuse' for killing his own daughter, and more. Marci Stone (US Headlines Examiner) reports, \"Friday afternoon, Santa is currently in Baghdad, Iraq and on his next stop is Moscow, Russia, according to the 2010 NORAD Santa Tracker. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has been tracking Santa as he makes his annual journey throughout the world.\" Gerald Skoning (Palm Beach Post) quotes Santa saying, \"We send our special wishes for peace and goodwill to all. That includes the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.\" Please note that this is Santa's seventh trip to Iraq since the start of the Iraq War and, as usual, his journey was known in advance. No waiting until he hit the ground to announce he was going to Iraq -- the way George The Bully Boy Bush had to and the way US President Barack Obama still has to. In the lead up to Santa's yearly visit, many 'authorities' in Iraq began insisting that Christmas couldn't be celebrated publicly, that even Santa was banned. Gabriel Gatehouse (BBC News) quotes Shemmi Hanna stating, \"I wasn't hurt but I wish that I had been killed. I wish I had become a martyr for this church, but God kept me alive for my daughters.\" Shemmi Hanna was in Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad when it was assaulted October 31st and she lost her husband, her son, her daughter-in-law and her infant grandson in the attack. The October 31st attack marks the latest wave of violence targeting Iraqi Christians. The violence has led many to flee to northern Iraq (KRG) or to other countries. Zvi Bar'el (Haaretz) notes, \"This week the Iraqi legislature discussed the Christians' situation and passed a resolution in principle to help families who fled."

      "Finally, the jet structure disappears. The second quantitative comparison is the interface structure described by the length and width of the bubble, as shown in Fig. . The experimental data are extracted from Fig. , in Ref. . Quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results are seen. For the profile of bubble width, there are mainly two stages. At an early time (t < 150\u00b5s), it decreases to a minimum value because of the shock compression effect. After the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 150\u00b5s), the developed vortex pair caused by the deposited vorticity gradually dominates the growth of bubble width. Different from width evolution, the temporal variation of length experiences three stages. In the early stages (t < 150\u00b5s), it decreases quickly due to the shock compression effect. Then, the jet structure emerges, which results in a growth in length (150\u00b5s < t < 250\u00b5s). Because the upstream interface moves faster than the downstream interface, the bubble length would decrease at 250\u00b5s < t < 500\u00b5s. In the third stage (t > 500\u00b5s), the vortex pair forms and then leads to a continuous development of bubble length. Both the length and width experience oscillations in the later stages due to complex wave patterns. The quantitative agreements between DBM simulation and experimental results indicate the following two facts: (i) the order of TNE considered in the current DBM is sufficient, (ii) the choosing of discrete velocities and spatial-temporal steps and simulation parameters like the relaxation times is suitable for characterizing the deformation of bubble, wave patterns, main characteristics of flow morphology. Effects of specific-heat ratio on SBI\n\nThe major of current works on SBI research have not focused on specific-heat ratio effects. In this part, the simulation parameters are fine-adjusted based on the parameters in Section 3.1 to highlight the influence of specific-heat ratio. Through adjusting the extra degree of freedom I, five cases with various specific-heat ratios of the bubble are simulated, i.e., \u03b3 = 1.4,\n1.28, 1.18, 1.12, and 1.09."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain. The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich \u03b3-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body."

    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The first two of those values -- it will not surprise you to know -- were freedom of discourse and individual privacy. But there were more: freedom of economic choice is one; the general welfare another; popular sovereignty, worth pausing on, I described as avoiding concentrations of economic and political power in any sector of industry or government that impinge unduly on the freedoms or welfare of the citizenry. And then there is progress, social progress, the fostering, I said, of market incentives and opportunities for technological and service innovations and for widened consumer choice among technologies and services. Now obviously if you give just a moment's thought to it, you will recognize, as I think we have in this conference, that these values can collide with each other at key points, and therefore accommodations must be made. For that we need processes of accommodation. I also suggested some of those. After you identify the relevant values and goals, you then should ask yourself about the necessity and the appropriateness of having government make any decision on the matter. And this has to do with such things like the adequacy of decision-making standards, the availability of adequate information, and the adequacy of personnel resources to deal with it. Then you get into dividing up the possible roles of the various elements of government -- the regulatory agencies, the Executive Branch, the Judiciary, and the Congress. It doesn't stop there, because you need to ask about international implications, which we have done some of here. And federal/state implications -- very often allowing the state to make a stab at social ordering in the first instance is, as Justice Brandeis often said, the best way, through the social laboratory technique, to try out what is the right answer, without endangering the whole society. And as we have heard today, we need also to think about the availability of non-coercive instruments of accommodation, like a federal data protection board."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843\u201344 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially. The first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes."

      "I know this article is narrowly focused on the hardware, but MS and Intel getting into hardware, Amazon getting into hardware, Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Automobile companies started making their own engines and with rare exceptions, never went back to being more horizontal. Same with retail and their store brands. Same with cloud companies and their servers. Same with mobile companies and their OSs. The horizontal market of PCs created by long-lasting standards and loose hegemony is the exception, not the norm. Why wouldn't the foundries be able close the process gap with Intel? Is it a matter of money? Scale? I'm not so sure about several things:1- Moore's law's relevance. Moore's Law is about ICs. ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops: screens, batteries, radios are a huge part of tablets' and phones' costs, as opposed to the bare SoC + RAM.2- The tablet vs phone dichotomy. For some reason (probably price insensitivity due to subsidies), Phones have a tendency to be more powerful than Tablets, ie phone SoCs are more than good enough for tablets. Since the OS and peripherals are the same, it makes more sense to design and build just one type of SoC, and just disable the phone-modem part of it (even the other radios are still required: BT, Wifi, GPS...), same as Intel disable cache and cores for their entry-level CPUs. Once you're fabbing a SoC, it makes more sense to make more of the same than to setup a separate run of a cut-down SoC on an older process, unless volumes are huge. We might still be getting previous-generation, well amortized SoCs in cheaper tablets, though.3- On the contrary, I see a tablet and phone convergence (the ugly phablet). I'm patiently waiting for the new 6\"+ phones to replace my Nook Color and Galaxy Note 1 with a single device.4- The advantage of diversity ?"

      "In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace\u2014the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years. In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood."

      "This will increase yields dramatically. Of course Samsung and TSMC will build ARM out, but it definitely puts quite a bit of pressure on all other manufacturers. As the article mentions Intel and Samsung are the only ones who control production top to bottom, and Samsung must share some of the benefits with ARM. As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy. The mobile industry moved to horizontal integration a long time ago. Better indicators than these odd contemporary obsessions with the relatively non-innovative Samsung and Apple where when Motorola spun out its semiconductor division as Freescale, Nokia stopped making it's own custom designs with TI and ST, and Ericsson spun out it's Ericsson Mobile Platforms division and formed ST-Ericsson with ST.The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. Under the hood most stuff has been on a simple linear evolutionary path by the SoC providers since then. The phone manufacturers have then mainly been simply sticking these off-the-shelf SoCs (and their included low-level software stacks) in a box, a job made all the easier with the SoC manufacturer collaboration providing the bulk of the work for the AOSP.

      "In our experiments, we tried two datasets of images with different gap sizes. We observed that the best the \u03b3 for one set of samples is \u223c 5 (the set with shorter gaps) while it is \u223c 23 for samples from the other set, i. e, the set with longer gaps (see Figure for some completed examples). Experiments and Results\n\nPerforming unsupervised contour completion is a difficult task to benchmark as one can never know what fragments exactly are connected to each other in a real-world scenario. This makes the problem of contour completion a hard problem to solve. In this paper, we tried to create artificial shapes that are occluded by some masks and then tried to see if our model can regenerate the missing pieces and glue those divided contours together. To demonstrate our model's behavior, we will conduct experiments on datasets created for this task and will report on them in this section. To compare network results in different settings, we will use pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Intersection over Union (IoU) between the produced result of the network and unmasked ground truth data and the reconstructed image on black pixels (where contours live). Data\n\nWe prepared two datasets, one labeled \"Simple\" and one \"Complex\", in accordance with the number of gaps in each shape. Both datasets contain nine different categories of shapes. In order to generate the Complex dataset, we used FlatShapeNet which is a dataset for the educational game Ariga. The dataset includes the following categories: Circle, Kite, Parallelogram, Rectangle, Rhombus, Square, Trapezoid, Triangle and Overlap. The \"overlap\" category contains images that are made as a mixture of two shapes that are overlapping from the previous categories. These are some standard shapes with a few gaps in simple dataset, while the complex dataset has some hand-drawn shapes with fragmented lines and more gaps that produce more variety in general. For each instance, a ground truth image is available for comparison. Most of our experiments have been conducted using the complex dataset in order to evaluate the generalization of our approach."

      "These 6 classes are a proper subset of the 9 classes from Track-1. Thus, an intuitive baseline for Track-2 is to use the model finetuned for Track-1, whilst considering only the relevant classes for the latter task. The classes EN , ES and P T , i.e. the classes without any national dialect associated with them are not included in Track-2 as compared to Track-1. Thus, we calculate the predictions for the Track-2 validation dataset using the models for Track-1 and exclude the metrics for Track-1 specific classes to get the metrics for this \"adapted\" 2-way classification. We show the results of this experiment in Table and observe that, as expected, the adapted 2-way classification performs worse compared to the explicitly finetuned variant. Results for Track-1 and Track-2\n\nWe now present our experiments and their performance for both tracks. Our experiments for Track-1 are described in Table and our experiments for Track-2 are described in Table . The participants were allowed three submissions for evaluation on the test set, so we submitted predictions using the three systems which performed the best on the validation set. As mentioned in Section 5.2, we performed 2 3 , i.e. a total of 8 experiments using the two best models for each language. We observed that RoBERTa base on English, Spanish BERT base on Spanish and Portuguese BERT base performed the best on the testing set for Track-1. The same combination, with RoBERTa base for English, worked best for Track-2. All of our submissions were the top submissions for each track, which surpassed the next best competitors by a margin of 4.5% and 5.6% for Track-1 and Track-2 respectively. Ablation of best submissions\n\nWe hereby make some observations of our submissions and other experiments. To assist this, we plot the confusion matrices of our best submissions for Track-1 and Track-2 in Figures respectively.

      "But there is the other side, and that's the planetary managers. Planetary management is the path of the least resistance. You know all the powermongers go for the planetary management model, because they all think they can clamber over the bodies to get to the top. Ultimately the test is going to be who comes out on the top, the individual rightist or the planetary managers. Unfortunately, I'm not a betting man, but at the moment I'd like to bet on the planetary managers. DYSON: Part of this issue is reducing the value of incumbency, whether it's incumbency in prime time live, or incumbency in the government. There is much more fluidity of movement; you can't accumulate power because the unorganized forces have more power than you do. P. DENNING: I feel a little strange being on the left end of the stage, because most people think of me as being on the far right sometimes, but right now I'd like to comment on something that is halfway between what Mitch is saying, and what Simon is saying. The way I hear what Simon is saying, is that there is a disease of today which I will call inward- centeredness. We are very worried about ourselves and our organizations. We find in that orientation a lot of instability of things and technologies that change rapidly. In order to achieve the world that Mitch is talking about, we need to cure the disease, and instead come from an orientation that we could call outward-centeredness, instead of inward-centeredness. The question is the shift from, How do we accumulate power? to, How do we help others accumulate power? How do we go from looking for stability in things to looking for stability in relationships? In watching my own children grow up, I am convinced that they know more about this than I do. In listening to some of the younger people here, I'm more convinced that they know more about this than I do. They know something about the outward-centeredness that I have yet to learn. Observing this among children and among students gives me a lot of optimism, as a matter of fact, against the apocalypse that Simon talks about, because Simon is talking about the world that would be created if we continued \"us,\" and I think that the world that is being created by our children with their outward-centeredness is going to be the kind of world that Mitch is pointing towards."

      "Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer. Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \\cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal L}\\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mbox{L}_i\n    \\end{eqnarray}  \n    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small.

Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place. Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\\cal L}$ is defined as,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{L}_t &\\equiv& \\mathcal{L}  - x \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}} - (1-x) \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}} \\label{$t$PLF} \n   \\end{eqnarray}\n   where \n   \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables.

In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\\cite{Decelle14}.

      "Recent work on the availability of data on lithics assemblages found a low level of data sharing (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018) and there are perceptions of low levels of data reuse (Huggett 2018; Kintigh et al. 2018). Within zooarchaeology numerous studies have explored issues of data sharing and reuse (Kansa & Kansa 2013, 2014), and the sub-discipline is seen as one of the most advanced areas of archaeology in regards to open science (Cooper & Green 2016: 273). Beyond zooarchaeology, however, explicit discussion has remained limited. This paper assesses data sharing and reuse practices in archaeology through the case study of archaeobotany \u2013 a long established sub-discipline within archaeology which has well-established principles of data recording. Archaeobotany is an interesting case study for data sharing in archaeology as it straddles the division of archaeology between scientific and more traditional techniques. Quantitative data on archaeological plant remains are also of interest to a range of other fields, including ecology, environmental studies, biology and earth sciences. The key issues of data sharing and data reuse (Atici et al. 2013) have been touched upon in archaeobotany over the past decade within broader discussions on data quality (Van der Veen, Livarda & Hill 2007; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). These earlier studies focussed on the quality and availability of archaeobotanical data from developer-funded excavations in Britain and Cultural Resource Management in North America (Vanderwarker et al. 2016: 156). However, no discussion of data-sharing and reuse in academic archaeobotany occurred. A recent review of digital methods in archaeobotany is the notable exception, with discussions of the challenges and methods of data sharing (Warinner & d\u2019Alpoim Guedes 2014). Currently, we have no evidence for the levels of data sharing and reuse within archaeobotany. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of 1) data publication in recent archaeobotanical journal articles 2) data citation in recent archaeobotanical meta-analysis 3) the reuse of archaeobotanical datasets, in order to assess whether practices need to change and how such changes can take place."

      "Well, the civil war appears to be over. And Islamism won it. The loser, moderate Islam, is always deceptively well-represented on the level of the op-ed page and the public debate; elsewhere, it is supine and inaudible. We are not hearing from moderate Islam. Whereas Islamism, as a mover and shaper of world events, is pretty well all there is. So, to repeat, we respect Islam - the donor of countless benefits to mankind, and the possessor of a thrilling history. But Islamism? No, we can hardly be asked to respect a creedal wave that calls for our own elimination. More, we regard the Great Leap Backwards as a tragic development in Islam's story, and now in ours. Naturally we respect Islam. But we do not respect Islamism, just as we respect Muhammad and do not respect Muhammad Atta. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649

      "Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector. The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate. Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process. The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership."

      "EXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate our model on a simulated navigation task where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a priori while respecting the path preferences indicated by a human. The robot navigates in a grid world containing obstacles. The transition model is deterministic: the robot selects an adjacent location on the grid to reach at the next time step. The robot is also allowed to take diagonal actions. Each location s t in the map can be mapped to a vertex v t \u2208 G. Therefore, the actions leading to locations mapped to different vertices correspond to edges on the graph. We note f (s t , a t ) the edge crossed by taking action a t from location s t . The robot is given a mission time limit T max for reaching the goal. In this problem, we assume that the human selects actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is defined as per eq. ( ), corresponding to the length of the shortest path to the goal constrained by the preference (where the robot is only allowed to make transitions on G along preferred edges). More specifically, where \u03b4(s t , g | o t , p vt ) designates the length of the shortest path from s t to g passing by o t and constrained by preference p vt . This is a slight variant of the cost function proposed by Best and Fitch , where we add in a conditioning on the path preference. We compute costs by running the A path planning algorithm on the environment maps (grid worlds with diagonal actions) and impose preference constraints by pruning invalid transitions from the search tree. Reward model. At each step in time, the robot receives a reward which is a sum of three components: a goal-specific reward a preference-specific reward or penalty We compute solutions to the POMDP defined in section III-B with the online solver POMCP , and with the particularity that within the rollouts, the robot does not expect to collect human inputs. Each time a solution is computed, the robot takes an action and may receive an observation. If it does, it updates its belief distribution over the unknown problem variables and resolves the POMDP over a receding horizon."

      "Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society. Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra\u2018ad (\u0631\u0639\u062f) applied to the electric ray. Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature."

      "Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer. Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \\cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal L}\\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mbox{L}_i\n    \\end{eqnarray}  \n    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place. Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\\cal L}$ is defined as,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{L}_t &\\equiv& \\mathcal{L}  - x \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}} - (1-x) \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}} \\label{$t$PLF} \n   \\end{eqnarray}\n   where \n   \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables. In the XY case: $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}=-\\ln{2 \\pi}$.\n   \\item\n   $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood in the fully-connected model and it is maximized over all the $N(N-1)/2$ possible couplings. \n   \\end{itemize} At the first step, when $x=1$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm max}$ and  $\\mathcal{L}_t=0$. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\\mathcal{L}_t =0$. In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \\ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings."

      "In that this technology is a vehicle of communication, I believe that it is a vehicle of the truth, and as long as we keep it free, the truth will be heard that much more. Now I have kind of a question with a bit of a statement. I am a learning-disabled college student. I didn't ever finish high school. I had a freshmen education in high school, because of educational problems, and adjustment problems, I never really got too far beyond that. I write probably a fifth of the speed of anyone in this room and I have a real hard time doing math without a calculator. That's part of the reason why I wasn't able to do well in school. I read very well, fortunately, so I was able to go in when I was eighteen and take my GED just flat out without studying for it. I'm not dumb, or uneducated by any standards, but what has allowed me to get an associate's degree in college, and what has allowed me to approach graduation and get a bachelor's degree in college is the kind of technology that we are dealing with. I have never had easy access to that technology. The barriers that I have faced have been ones of order, regimentation, and where people try and say, \"Oh well, you don't fit in, you're not a CS student, you don't need those resources.\" I'm good with computers, I do a lot with them, I spend a lot of time with them. I hack, I don't do anything illegal, but I took a hacksaw to the frame of my nasty little 8088 about two years ago to cram some RAM into it, because that was the only way I could get it to fit and I needed it. Now I'm in a little bit better shape. I'm approaching the point where I would like to see ISDN real soon, because I need that kind of connectivity. You know, I'm doing interesting things that I find absolutely wonderful, but the idea that the kind of technology that is available to us, that is just there for the using, could be limited and unavailable to people, or that people would have to go through some of the things that I have had to go through, not being able to do well on tests, because I had no word processor available to me."

The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force. Goodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities.

      "The Raithel group also found direct evidence for electron collisional $\\ell$-mixing in a Rb MOT \\cite{Dutta}, and used selective field ionization to monitor evolution to plasma on a microsecond timescale in ultracold $^{85}$Rb $65d$ Rydberg gases with densities as low as $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ \\cite{WalzFlannigan}. Research by our group at UBC has observed very much the same dynamics in the relaxation of Xe Rydberg gases of similar density prepared in a molecular beam \\cite{Hung2014}. In both cases, the time evolution to avalanche is well-described by coupled rate equations (see below), assuming an initializing density of Penning electrons determined by Robicheaux's criterion \\cite{Robicheaux05}, applied to an Erlang distribution of Rydberg-Rydberg nearest neighbours. Theoretical investigations of ultracold plasma physics have focused for the most part on the long- and short-time dynamics of plasmas formed by direct photoionization \\cite{PhysRept,Lyon}. In addition to studies mentioned above, key insights on the evolution dynamics of Rydberg gases have been provided by studies of Pohl and coworkers exploring the effects of ion correlations and recombination-reionization on the hydrodynamics of plasma expansion \\cite{Pohl:2003,PPR}. Further research has drawn upon molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reformulate rate coefficients for the transitions driven by electron impact between highly excited Rydberg states \\cite{PVS}, and describe an effect of strong coupling as it suppresses three-body recombination \\cite{Bannasch:2011}. MD simulations confirm the accuracy of coupled rate equation descriptions for systems with $\\Gamma$ as large as 0.3. Newer calculations suggest a strong connection between the order created by dipole blockade in Rydberg gases and the most favourable correlated distribution of ions in a corresponding strongly coupled ultracold plasma \\cite{Bannasch:2013}.

The Society Committee on Budget & Finance met on Saturday, March 24, to review the society's 2006 financial performance. The society ended 2006 with a net contribution from operations of $12.2 million, on revenues of $424.0 million and expenses of $411.8 million. This was $7.8 million favorable to the approved budget. After including the results of the Member Insurance Program and new ventures, the society's overall net contribution for 2006 was $11.5 million, which was $7.4 million favorable to the approved budget. The favorable variance was primarily attributable to higher than budgeted electronic services revenue and investment income, as well as expense savings from lower than budgeted health care costs and reduced IT spending. In addition, the society ended the year in compliance with the board-established financial guidelines. The Society Committee on Education (SOCED) received an update from President Catherine Hunt on the thematic programming featured in Chicago focusing on the sustainability of energy, food, and water. President-Elect Bruce Bursten solicited input from the committee pertaining to the central role of education in his agenda. SOCED received a presentation from the Membership Affairs Committee on its white paper on membership requirements. Committee members strongly support the proposal to include undergraduates as members of the society, but they requested that financial arrangements be clearly spelled out in the petition to ensure that the highly successful Student Affiliates program remains intact. The committee discussed the Education Division programs that were reviewed in 2006 and those that will be reviewed in 2007, under the auspices of the Program Review Advisory Group.

(b) ZFC-FC curves for in-plane and out-of-plane applied fields (0.015 T).}\n\\label{fig10}\n\\end{figure} In order to derive the magnetic size and anisotropy of the Mn-rich nanocolumns embedded in the Ge matrix, we have fitted the inverse normalized in-plane (resp. out-of-plane) susceptibility: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}$ (resp. $\\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}$). The corresponding experimental ZFC-FC curves are reported in Fig. 10b. Since susceptibility measurements are performed at low field (0.015 T), the matrix magnetic signal remains negligible. In order to normalize susceptibility data, we need to divide the magnetic moment by the saturated magnetic moment recorded at 5 T. However the matrix magnetic signal becomes very strong at 5 T and low temperature so that we need to subtract it from the saturated magnetic moment using a simple Curie function. From Fig. 10b, we can conclude that nanocolumns are isotropic. Therefore to fit experimental data we use the following expression well suited for isotropic systems or cubic anisotropy: $\\chi_{\\parallel}^{-1}= \\chi_{\\perp}^{-1}\\approx 3k_{B}T/M(T)+\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$. $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $M=M_{s}v$ is the magnetic moment of a single-domain nanostructure (macrospin approximation) where $M_{s}$ is its magnetization and $v$ its volume. The in-plane magnetic field is applied along $[110]$ or $[-110]$ crystal axes. Since the nanostructures Curie temperature does not exceed 170 K, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization is also accounted for by writting $M(T)$. Antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures are also considered by adding an effective field estimated in the mean field approximation \\cite{Fruc02}: $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$.\nThe only fitting parameters are the maximum magnetic moment (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature) per nanostructure: $M$ (in Bohr magnetons $\\mu_{B}$) and the maximum interaction field (\\textit{i.e.} at low temperature): $\\mu_{0}H_{eff}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\center\n   \\includegraphics[width=.7\\linewidth]{./fig11.eps}\n\\caption{Temperature dependence of the inverse in-plane (open circles) and out-of-plane (open squares) normalized susceptibilities of a Ge$_{0.887}$Mn$_{0.113}$ sample grown at 115$^{\\circ}$C.

Types of data collected on fishing behaviour and catch composition during daily landings data collection at Tanjung Luar. From fishing behaviour and catch data we calculated the overall species composition of catch. We calculated catch per unit effort (CPUE) by number of individuals using both catch per set (hereafter CPUE per set) and catch per 100 hooks per set (hereafter standardised CPUE) [25,26]. This was deemed necessary since different vessels and gear-types systematically deploy different numbers of hooks, and standardised CPUE allows for a more meaningful comparison. To understand factors influencing overall CPUE we log transformed CPUE per trip to fit a normal distribution, and fitted linear models (LMs) of CPUE per trip to fishing behaviour variables (Table 1). We considered all variables and used minimum AIC values with stepwise analysis of variance to identify the best fit and most significant influencing variables. To inform the development of practical fisheries management measures (e.g. gear restrictions), we also specifically analysed differences in CPUE for surface and bottom longline gears employed in the fishery, using two-way ANOVAs.

      "We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods. However, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance. System Description\n\nThis was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT). The LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification. For dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa. All models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results\n\nExperiments using Large Language Models\n\nFor the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned. First, we experimented with different models for Track-1. All the models were trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-6, weight decay 1e-6 and a batch size of 8."

JACK CAFFERTY, THE CAFFERTY FILE: Well, they had another little temblor in Japan -- a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Northeastern Japan today, the strongest aftershock since that massive 9.0 quake and tsunami that followed devastated that nation four weeks ago. And this one today was in roughly the same area. One of the big concerns, of course, is possible further damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, which operates the plant -- or what's left of it -- said there were no serious incidents as a result of today's aftershock. So they say. Radioactivity from that plant has poisoned the surrounding land, air and ocean. Millions of people have been exposed. Millions more could be, as radioactivity has been picked up in food and drinking water and detected in faraway places, like California."

Hundreds of individuals have contributed to this major effort, since MAC began such discussions at the spring 2004 national meeting. The Committee on Ethics met in Chicago and discussed the possibility of organizing and scheduling a committee retreat in the near future to enable the committee to move from the current stage of exploring the needs and interests of ACS members to setting priorities for the next few years. The Project SEED program offers summer research opportunities for high school students from economically disadvantaged families. Since its inception in 1968, the program has had a significant impact on the lives of more than 8,400 students. At the selection meeting in March, the committee approved research projects for 340 SEED I students and 98 SEED II students for this summer in more than 100 institutions.

      "Leading up to this I had been battling anxiety and depression which my husband found very hard to cope with. Over the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage. Please Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future. Thank you for listening and your site. I have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate. I did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she\u2019s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn\u2019t want to come home (the next day after school).

Daughter\u2019s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it). I didn\u2019t really want this but made a compromise that daughter would go there Tues morning \u2013 Friday afternoon as the friend is an A student whereas my daughter is failing.

      "Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage. So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, \"Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?\" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction. Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society."

He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations\u2014he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact. At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the M\u0101ori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister.

      "This will increase yields dramatically. Of course Samsung and TSMC will build ARM out, but it definitely puts quite a bit of pressure on all other manufacturers. As the article mentions Intel and Samsung are the only ones who control production top to bottom, and Samsung must share some of the benefits with ARM. As someone who has worked in the semiconductor industry for longer than contemporary fanboys have existed, I'm getting a bit fed-up seeing many of these articles which rewrite history with analyses distorted by the lens of the contemporary Apple or Samsung fanboy. The mobile industry moved to horizontal integration a long time ago. Better indicators than these odd contemporary obsessions with the relatively non-innovative Samsung and Apple where when Motorola spun out its semiconductor division as Freescale, Nokia stopped making it's own custom designs with TI and ST, and Ericsson spun out it's Ericsson Mobile Platforms division and formed ST-Ericsson with ST.The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. Under the hood most stuff has been on a simple linear evolutionary path by the SoC providers since then. The phone manufacturers have then mainly been simply sticking these off-the-shelf SoCs (and their included low-level software stacks) in a box, a job made all the easier with the SoC manufacturer collaboration providing the bulk of the work for the AOSP.

      "However, the difference is not significant for RSA (t = 1.117, p = 0.327). Specifically, the similarity score of SEW ResNet152 is only slightly higher than that of ResNet152, and at the depth of 50 and 101, SEW ResNet's scores are lower than ResNet's. Macaque-Synthetic dataset. Similar to the results of Allen Brain dataset, no model performs best for all three metrics. SEW ResNet performs moderately better than ResNet (t = 3.354, p = 0.028; t = 3.824, p = 0.019; t = 2.343, p = 0.079). The only contrary is that SEW ResNet18 performs worse than ResNet18 for RSA. Further, to check the details of comparison between the SNNs and their CNN counterparts, we analyze the trajectories of similarity score across model layers (Figure ). As for ResNet and SEW ResNet with the same depth, the trends of their similarities across model layers are almost the same, but the former's trajectory is generally below the latter's. In other words, the similarity scores of SEW ResNet are higher than those of ResNet at almost all layers. Taken together, the results suggest that when the overall results that appear below also correspond to the three metrics in this order, unless the correspondence is stated in the text. architectures and depth are the same, SNNs with spiking neurons perform consistently better than their counterparts of CNNs with an average increase of 6.6%. Besides, SEW ResNet14 also outperforms the brain-like recurrent CNN, CORnet-S, with the same number of layers (see more details in Appendix B). Two properties of SNNs might contribute to the higher similarity scores. On the one hand, IF neurons are the basic neurons of spiking neural networks. The IF neuron uses several differential equations to roughly approximate the membrane potential dynamics of biological neurons, which provides a more biologically plausible spike mechanism for the network. On the other hand, the spiking neural network is able to capture the temporal features by incorporating both time and binary signals, just like the biological visual system during information processing."

Mathis, Jennifer L. Furman, Christopher M. Norris. Institutions: University of Kentucky College of Public Health, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine. The rodent hippocampal slice preparation is perhaps the most broadly used tool for investigating mammalian synaptic function and plasticity. The hippocampus can be extracted quickly and easily from rats and mice and slices remain viable for hours in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, basic electrophysisologic techniques are easily applied to the investigation of synaptic function in hippocampal slices and have provided some of the best biomarkers for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity."

      "Each of those manufacturers knew that smartphones would eventually be awesome, but none of them had the UI and software design to make a truly breakout product.

And when you think about it, which consumes more man years of engineering effort per year at this point.... iterating that cellular black box or developing the OS, services and apps that power today's smartphones?\nIntel had better decide that they are competing in this space \"for real\", or they are screwed. They've already let the Atom languish for five years, during which ARM has completely caught up in performance. Just like Tim Cook said, if you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you. Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. Personally, I hope they don't; if Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits. I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package. Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage. This isn't just going to impact mobile either. Take a look at that JEDEC link."

In addition to obtaining the power-law exponents, we have also verified the adequacy of the power-law hypothesis using the procedure originally proposed by Clauset et al. as adapted by Preis et al. . This procedure consists of generating synthetic samples under the power-law hypothesis with the same properties of the empirical data under analysis (that is, same length and parameters \u03b1 and r min ), adjusting the simulated data with the power-law model via the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method, and calculating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (\u03ba syn ) between the distributions obtained from the simulated samples and the adjusted power-law model. Next, the values of \u03ba syn are compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic calculated between empirical data and the power-law model (\u03ba). Finally, a p-value is defined by calculating the fraction of times for which \u03ba syn > \u03ba. We have used one thousand synthetic samples for each position of the expanding time window and the more conservative 90% confidence level (instead of the more lenient and commonly used 95% confidence level), such that the power-law hypothesis is rejected whenever p-value \u2264 0.1. We have estimated the effects of age and market capitalization on the power-law exponents associated with positive or negative returns of a given cryptocurrency using the linear model where \u03b1 t represents the power-law exponent, log c t is the logarithm of the market capitalization, and y t is the age (in years) of the cryptocurrency at t-th observation. Moreover, K is the intercept of the association, while C and A are linear coefficients quantifying the effects of market capitalization and age, respectively. Finally, N (\u00b5, \u03c3 ) stands for the normal distribution with mean \u00b5 and standard deviation \u03c3 , such that the parameter \u03b5 accounts for the unobserved determinants in the dynamics of the power-law exponents.

He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know. I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling."

By solving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations. \\section{Experimental section}\n\nThe experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum."

      "You can see the execution of the third experiment in the middle part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to perform robot to human handovers. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the vertical position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, the arm stays still, the human grasps the object from the bottom and slightly pushes it up, the hand then detects that there is a supporting surface and starts to slowly release the object. You can see the execution of the fourth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . This experiment is similar to previous one, but the grasp type that the robot uses is a pinch grasp, that involves only the thumb and the index finger. To perform this we only had to alter the grasp type conditional variable that was given to the posture mapping function. You can see the execution of the fifth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . In the first part (blue) of the experiment the robot closes its grasp, by reducing the grasp size, until the normal force is below the force offset. In the next three parts (pink, green, red) the person throws coins in the cup to increase its weight. You can see in the signal plots that each time coins are added the tangential force decreases so the normal force threshold decreases too. The grasp sizes then decreases as well in order to apply more normal force. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle perturbations in the weight of the object during grasping. CONCLUSION In summary, we presented a controller that uses force feedback integrated with conditional synergies to control a dexterous robotic hand to grasp and release objects. We demonstrated that our controller can lift objects of different weights and materials while avoiding slip, react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans."

    "question": "What is the primary reason why the moving agents' evolved learning rate \u03b7p decreases as the transition probability p_tr increases?",

      "A) The moving agents' initial weights are set to the average of E1 and E2, which leads to a slower learning rate.",
      "B) The increased transition probability p_tr allows the agents to gather more data, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the environment's ingredient values.",
      "C) The moving agents' plastic network is less effective in converging to interpretable weights due to the increased environmental complexity.",
      "D) The moving agents' dependence on the parameters of the environment, including d_e and p_tr, leads to a decrease in the evolved learning rate \u03b7p as p_tr increases."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "D)",
    "documentation": [
      "The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ). After \u223c 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr . At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions. Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents. This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p are largely maintained in the moving agents."

One way of looking at this is choosing to believe that seeing a cardiologist will ease your mind one way or the other \u2013 so this is something to look forward to, not dread. If the cardiologist spots something suspicious, a treatment plan will be created. If not, you can wave goodbye and go back to happily living your life. Try thinking of this cardiology appointment just as you would if your car were making some frightening noises and you were bringing it to your mechanic for a check up. You could work yourself into a complete state worrying ahead of time if the car trouble is going to be serious, or you could look at this appointment as the solution \u2013 at last! \u2013 to figuring out what\u2019s wrong so the mechanic can recommend the next step.

THANK YOU, I have been looking for translations FOR PATIENTS not med school graduates\u2013 like this for three years. My family doctor had me wear a 24 hr EKG. After reading the results, she has scheduled a scope to look inside my heart by a specialist. Completely forgoing a stress test. Said I have major changes in the EKG, what type of changes could they be looking at? Had LAD STENT INSERTED 7 YRS AGO \u2013 WHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR? This is a great wealth of information, Carolyn! I looked and did not see my diagnosis, which is aortic stenosis. I looked under aortic as well as stenosis. Did I just miss it somehow? I learned some new information, I am a bit familiar now, but not when I had my MI, it was like learning a new language. But, my favorite part was seeing SCAD on this list! Thank you.\nThanks and welcome! I was thinking of editing that SCAD definition actually: I suspect that that it isn\u2019t so much that SCAD is \u201crare\u201d, but it\u2019s more that it\u2019s \u201crarely correctly diagnosed\u201d.

These documents were approved and signed by Sonny Partono (Director General of Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem MoEF), Sjarief Widjaja (Secretary General MMAF), and Djoko Suprianto (Acting Head of MFA of West Nusa Tenggara Province). Due to this MoU and TCA no specific research permit was required. We collected data by measuring sharks that were already caught, dead, and landed by fishers in Tanjung Luar, with no incentives, compensation or specific requests for killing sharks for this study. WCS participates in the Conservation Initiative on Human Rights and the rules and guidelines of our Internal Review Board ensures that any research protects the rights of human subjects. We did not apply for an IRB permit for this study because our study design focused on collecting fish and fisheries data as opposed to personal socio-economic data. The FDGs and interviews were conducted to obtain early scoping information about fishing practices, and to establish protocols for more detailed fisheries data collection (as used in this study), and socio-economic data collection (as used in a later study (Lestari et al ), which underwent further ethical review due to the specific focus on human subjects). Tanjung Luar, located in East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia (Fig 1), is a landing site for one of Indonesia\u2019s most well-known targeted shark fisheries. Tanjung Luar serves at least 1,000 vessels, and the majority of these are less than 10 gross tonnes (GT) in size . A group of specialised fishers operating from Tanjung Luar village and a neighbouring island, Gili Maringkik, specifically target sharks. Shark catch is landed in a dedicated auction facility at the Tanjung Luar port."

      "(1) polynomial \u03c3 ( (  To test how robust our approach is to deviations from the Gaussian assumption, we simulated the data from gamma and uniform distributions and conducted a simulation study for the same scenarios and examples. The results are very similar to those of the Gaussian distribution, see supplementary materials for the details. Application to Protein Dynamics\n\nWe revisit the data analysis of protein dynamics performed in Krivobokova et al. (2012) and . We consider data generated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the yeast aquaporin (Aqy1) -the gated water channel of the yeast Pichi pastoris. MD simulations are an established tool for studying biological systems at the atomic level on timescales of nano-to microseconds. The data are given as Euclidean coordinates of all 783 atoms of Aqy1 observed in a 100 nanosecond time frame, split into 20 000 equidistant observations. Additionally, the diameter of the channel y t at time t is given, measured by the distance between two centers of mass of certain residues of the protein. The aim of the analysis is to identify the collective motions of the atoms responsible for the channel opening. In order to model the response variable y t , which is a distance, based on the motions of the protein atoms, we chose to represent the protein structure by distances between atoms and certain fixed base points instead of Euclidean coordinates. That is, we calculated where A t,i \u2208 R 3 , i = 1, . . . , 783 denotes the i-th atom of the protein at time t, B j \u2208 R 3 , j = 1, 2, 3, 4, is the j-th base point and d(\u2022, \u2022) is the Euclidean distance. Figure shows the diameter y t and the distance between the first atom and the first center of mass. It can therefore be concluded that a linear model Y = X\u03b2 + holds, where\n. This linear model has two specific features which are intrinsic to the problem: first, the observations are not independent over time and second, X t is high-dimensional at each t and only few columns of X are relevant for Y ."
